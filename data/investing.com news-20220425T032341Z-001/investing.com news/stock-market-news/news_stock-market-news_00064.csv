LONDON/FRANKFURT/GENEVA (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) and alliance partner Nissan (T:7201) are discussing plans for a closer tie-up in which the Japanese carmaker would acquire the bulk of the French state's 15 percent Renault holding, people close to the matter told Reuters.
The carmakers are in talks with government officials over proposals by Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn that would see Paris give up influence at Renault and the French carmaker relinquish control over Nissan, according to three sources.
But any deal still faces significant hurdles - not least its extreme political sensitivity in France - and has yet to win government approval, they said. To do so, it must balance French and Japanese interests, avoiding the appearance of a takeover.
""Any discussion about a share transaction involving Renault, Nissan or the French state is pure speculation,"" Renault-Nissan spokesman Jonathan Adashek said. The alliance ""has no plans to change the cross-shareholding ratio of its member companies"", he added.
An official at the French finance ministry said the government ""totally denied"" it was ready to sell its Renault shares to Nissan. 
The sources said Renault was being advised by  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Nissan by Nomura on the planned stake sale, which would happen either as part of a broader Renault-Nissan combination or as a ""stepping stone"" on the way to one. The banks did not respond to requests for comment.
Ghosn has also proposed an interim structure that would see management of Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) overseen by a Dutch foundation as a prelude to their integration as a global automotive group based in Amsterdam, sources said.
""For the government, a Dutch foundation is not an option,"" said the finance ministry official, who declined to be named. 
Renault shares closed up around 5.6 percent at 94.44 euros.
The Renault-Nissan alliance, underpinned by cross-shareholdings, has wrestled intermittently since its 1999 inception with plans for full mergers that have foundered on objections from France, Renault's biggest shareholder.
But with Ghosn, the alliance's main architect, now beginning his final term as Renault CEO, the government has been pressing for a tie-up to secure the future of Renault-Nissan, the world's largest carmaking group by sales last year.
President Emmanuel Macron's government recently told Ghosn's representatives it would be ready to exit or sell down its Renault holding as part of a merger deal that secured French interests, according to multiple sources close to the talks.
Renault holds 43.4 percent of Nissan but agreed to limit formal control of its larger partner in a 2015 shareholder pact that defused a boardroom standoff with the French government. Nissan currently owns a 34 percent controlling stake in Mitsubishi and 15 percent of Renault, but no voting rights.
Under Tokyo market rules, Renault would lose all voting rights on its Nissan holding if the Japanese carmaker raised its Renault stake to 25 percent or more.
Any move by France to sell most or all of its Renault stake could prove politically risky for Macron, already under fire for letting national champions such as TGV train maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) fall into foreign hands.
Beyond its dilution and loss of influence, France remains concerned about the impact on technology centers, industrial jobs and tax revenues from a combined group headquartered elsewhere, the sources said.

To win acceptance, they added, the deal would need to include powerful concessions and guarantees to France, in areas such as jobs and investment, board representation and possible ""golden share"" veto rights over major strategic decisions.

Airbus, whose main rival is Boeing (N:BA), has cut production rates of the A380 - the world's largest passenger jet - due to weak demand, and it has also faced delays and cost overruns on the A400M military plane program.

16,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 09:52AM ET</span>",Trump's new tariffs couldn't come at a worse time for the auto industry," President Trump's new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum couldn't come at a worse time for the US automotive industry.
Auto sales in the US have already reached an inflection point after seven years of rocketing growth, and rising costs resulting from tariffs, higher interest rates, and any disruptions to global trade could all exacerbate any slowdown in the industry.
""If all this was happening in 2015 it wouldn't be as concerning because the market was growing like crazy"" Karl Brauer, publisher of Kelly's Blue Book said in an interview. ""But now we're in sort of a whipsaw effect at the end of a 7 year growth spurt.""
In February, US  new vehicle sales declined 2.4% from the previous month. That's less than the expected 4% drop, but continues a trend that began in 2017 when sales peaked after a strong run. The US auto market has grown from 10 million units sold in 2009 to over 17 million in 2016.
As car sales were taking off, steel production in China skyrocketed, creating a global glut that drove down prices worldwide. As this chart shows below, Chinese steel capacity (green) is barely a blip on the radar in 2000, but a majority of the world's production by last year.

""There's a problem with aluminum and steel production in the global economy largely because China has grown from being a very insignificant producer to supporting a huge growth in steel and aluminum production capacity,"" Kristin Dziczek, head of the industry, labor and economics group at the non-profit Center for Automotive Research, said in an interview.
""Now the US auto industry does not use a lot of Chinese steel, but the effect of that is that it pressures prices downward.""
If protections were to be placed on US production by the government, says Dziczek, prices will rise because manufacturers will be pushed to using domestic sources. Elsewhere, steel prices will stay low thanks to the economic principles of supply and demand. This is something US auto executives have already warned about.
“Tariffs are not good for anybody,” Steven Armstrong, head of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co.’s European operations, told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. “Any form of tariff is going to be bad news for us and lift our costs, and we’re going to pass that through, probably to the consumer.""
Other European carmakers echoed Armstrong's sentiment in Geneva this week.
""We all put our efforts into globalization in the past decades, and I think we shouldn't give up that idea so easily,"" Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Matthias Mueller told Automotive News. More than half of the 804,000 cars produced in Germany last year were exported outside the country, according to the German auto industry association.
To top it all off, rising interest rates as the Fed ends its quantitative easing program also have an outsize impact on the US auto industry.
""A strong economy, with low unemployment, and now a tax cut are all pushing toward increased consumer confidence and spending,"" said Kelly Blue Book's Brauer.
""That would generally translate into higher sales in every industry including automobiles, but what's counteracting that specifically for autos versus something like computers or houses are some additional forces that aren't as big a deal in some of those other industries like interest rates or the previous buying frenzy that has used up a lot of its energy — at least for the current cycle."""

The S&P 500 was down 13 points or 0.49% to 2,714.68 as of 9:43 AM ET (14:43 GMT) while the Dow composite decreased 152 points or 0.61% to 24,731.57, and tech heavy NASDAQ Composite slumped 23 points or 0.31% to 7,348.84.
Markets have been on edge since last week when U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States would impose 25% import tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminum. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:NYSE:GS) executive, was largely against the tariffs. Investors worry that his resignation could mean Trump will pass the tariffs and create a trade war.
Trump is expected to finalize the tariffs later in the week and choose a National Economic Council Director to replace Cohen in the next few weeks.
Airline maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) was among the lowest performers after the morning bell, falling 1.06% while  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) was down 1.46%. Streaming site Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) slumped 1.12% and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) decreased 1.50% while  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) inched down 1.07%.
Meanwhile United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) gained 2.99% and Abercrombie & Fitch Company (NYSE:ANF) surged 8.15% after its earnings were much higher than expected.
In economic news, U.S. private employers  added 235,000 jobs in February, much higher than expected. The numbers from payrolls processor ADP are a precursor to the jobs report on Friday and increase confidence on the strength of the U.S. economy.
In Europe stocks were up. In Germany the DAX rose 91 points or 0.76% while France’s CAC 40 increased 21 points or 0.42% and in London the FTSE 100 gained 2 points or 0.37%. Meanwhile Spain’s IBEX 35 was up two points or 0.02% and the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 inched up 11 points or 0.35%.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE), which was the most valuable publicly traded U.S. industrial conglomerate at the beginning of the year, could sink to the No. 4 spot after a prolonged selloff that has shaken confidence in the company.
Valued at close to $580 billion at the turn of the millennium, GE has dropped to around $125 billion and it was surpassed in value by 3M Co (N:MMM) in January for the first time since the 1970s.
At one point last week, the gap between GE and fellow U.S. industrial Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) was $6 billion, or 5 percent. The difference between GE and  United Tech  Corp's (N:UTX) market values fell to $15 billion.
(GRAPHIC: GE Market value - http://reut.rs/2D6JFB5)
Helping to narrow the gap is a 45 percent slide in GE stock over 2017 and a 16 percent fall this year.
Driven in value by a series of investments in several sectors during the 1990s, GE is now paying the price for focusing outside its traditional industrial manufacturing turf, while its rivals have enjoyed a more steady ascent thanks to a sharper focus on their industrial roots.
""All the large-cap diversified industrials like Honeywell, United Technologies and 3M to name a few, have benefited from some of the money that's come out of GE,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Steve Tusa, who has a five-star rating on Thomson Reuters Eikon for recommendation performance.
""You're really talking about maybe a mid-teens stock at 2020 ... $20 I think is a very long-term target that really isn't in the equation at this point,"" Tusa said of GE's shares, which closed at $14.64 on Monday.
Tusa rates GE's stock ""underweight"" with a price target of $14.
But some analysts are optimistic about GE's stock and future prospects.
William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann believes that the worse could be over for GE, and its shares are likely to begin stabilizing before moving higher as 2018 progresses.
""I think GE shares have been a bit oversold due to excessive fears about liquidity,"" Heymann wrote in a note.
Heymann cites higher oil prices, improving performance of GE's aviation and healthcare businesses, and the recent nomination of three ""exceptionally talented"" directors to GE's board. He has an ""outperform"" rating on the stock. 
GE shares slid even after the company replaced Jeff Immelt as CEO last August with John Flannery. His turnaround plan, which includes cutting jobs, slashing GE's dividend and a possible break-up of the conglomerate, is likely to take a year or more to show results.
When Immelt took over in September 2001, GE was the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company. But during his tenure, which ended July 2017, the stock price fell about 40 percent.
Over Jack Welch's stint as CEO from 1981 to 2001, GE's value rose from $13 billion to several hundred billions of dollars. Welch has since written or co-written bestselling books on management.
(GRAPHIC: GE share performance under three different CEOs - http://reut.rs/2Fh6rfu)
GE's stock trades at roughly 14 times its forecasted earnings, well below the multiples of its peers, as the graphic below shows. The number helps investors gauge the value of a company relative to its earnings.
Saint Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, best known for its Post-it notes and Scotch tape, saw its stock rise nearly 32 percent last year thanks to strong results that helped the company lift its yearly earnings forecast three times.
Honeywell's stock also rose around 32 percent in 2017, as the company sold more aircraft parts and as its energy customers bought more industrial equipment. Its warehouse automation equipment and software benefited from an ecommerce boom.
(GRAPHIC: GE Forward Earnings - http://reut.rs/2FlZtGg)
""We like Honeywell, given a solid management team and exposure to end markets we favor,"" said Richard Grasfeder, a portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth LLC, which holds about 787,600 shares in GE as of the end of 2017.
United Tech, which sells the Pratt & Whitney jet engines, has a ""significant long-term advantage"" over GE, Grasfeder said.

""We think United Tech could provide learning points for GE management and investors,"" Grasfeder said. ""Good leadership is critical.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain's biggest carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover (NS:TAMO) cautioned Prime Minister Theresa May that their plants would become more expensive and complicated to run if Brexit creates barriers to trade.
Ahead of Britain's exit, the world's biggest car companies are grappling with how they will import millions of components from around the world and then export cars made at British factories to European clients after a Brexit transition ends.
Carmakers already have plans on how to handle multiple scenarios including delays at ports which would hit a global business model reliant on the swift movement of components, engines and finished models across borders, executives said. 
""It costs us two-digit million number of pounds which is absolutely wasted if the one or the other condition is going to happen but at the end of the day we cannot risk the company,"" Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) Chief Executive Ralf Speth told Reuters at the Geneva Motor Show. 
""We are talking about minutes at the borders and if we are out of the minutes, we have huge disadvantages in terms of inventory, logistics and therefore we have to do all this kind of contingency planning now,"" said Speth, who heads Britain's biggest car company. 
He warned that any divergence in vehicle standards between Britain and the European Union, which are currently the same, would be a ""fallback to the Middle Ages."" 
While London and Brussels hope to agree a transition deal at an EU summit this month that will maintain the status quo until the end of 2020, companies are already trying to plan for an uncertain long-term future in Britain. 
At stake is the future of one of Britain's few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s: a car industry employing over 800,000 people and generating turnover of 77.5 billion pounds ($110 billion).
BMW and other companies will meet May and her finance minister, Philip Hammond, on Thursday to discuss Brexit, as the government seeks to assure them it will protect frictionless trade despite being outside the EU's tariff-free customs union.
The meeting comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to raise tariffs on foreign cars would hit British firms which import all their models sold to U.S. buyers, raising questions about May's aim to strike a trade deal with the United States.
On Brexit, Honda and Peugeot are also among those considering extra warehousing to hold larger stocks of components to protect their ""just-in-time"" production from any customs checks which could introduce delays after Brexit.
Honda's European Government affairs manager, who told lawmakers last year the Japanese carmaker would need to trigger its contingency plans this month, told Reuters the firm was awaiting further detail.
""We are monitoring the situation as the negotiations unfold and look forward to receiving additional clarity at the March council,"" said Patrick Keating. 
BMW's Mini said the complications of preparing for a loss of unfettered trade were huge.
""We don't know if each truck gets held up. We can build up bigger stocks so that we are more flexible in production. It is a nightmare right now,"" said board member Peter Schwarzenbauer.
The EU offered Britain on Wednesday a post-Brexit free-trade agreement that is modest compared with what London has called for. The 27 remaining EU members said the agreement would aim to cover trade in all goods sectors ""which should be subject to zero tariffs and no quantitative restrictions.""
FUTURE INVESTMENT AT RISK?
Boosting supplies and dealing with any new customs checks would allow British plants to keep operating, but such measures could make them less competitive against European rivals, making it harder to attract new models in future.
And while Nissan, Toyota and BMW have all announced new investment in Britain since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover and Peugeot warned at the Geneva Motor Show that they needed certainty to make upcoming choices.
""The sooner we have the clarity, the easier the decisions become to make, positive or negative,"" Ford's Europe boss Steven Armstrong told Reuters on Monday. 
Britain's car industry has been one of the most vocal in pushing to maintain the current access it enjoys with its biggest export market with investment slumping a third to 1.1 billion pounds ($1.55 billion) last year as many await clarity.
Peugeot could decide as soon as this year whether to keep its Vauxhall Ellesmere Port plant open whilst JLR is considering whether to build electric cars in its home market. 
Although many executives believe a transitional deal will be agreed, there are still question marks over the future of some aspects such as whether licenses granted by Britain's Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA) will remain valid across the EU.
Aston Martin's boss Andy Palmer said the quintessentially British firm, famed for being James Bond's car of choice, had ditched the VCA in favor of Spain's vehicle body for the time being, including for its next car, the next-generation Vanquish.

""When they tell us that they have no confidence that they’ll be able to test against European emissions, then as businesses you can wait and wait or you can delay and you can delay or eventually you have to decide,"" Palmer told Reuters.

32,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 08:40AM ET</span>",Unilever's Flora Food to close jumbo buyout loan,"By Claire Ruckin and Max Bower
LONDON (LPC) - Flora Food Group,  Unilever 's (AS:UNc) (L:ULVR) spreads business is set to allocate a €4.7bn-equivalent leveraged loan buyout financing after attracting around 80 major investors into the jumbo cross-border deal, banking sources said.
The company managed to raise €2.8bn-equivalent from European investors, comprising a £700m tranche and a €2bn tranche, the largest single-tranche euro-denominated term loan B since the financial crisis.
Last minute changes saw a dollar tranche increase by €100m-equivalent to US$875m, partly at the expense of unsecured bonds. At the same time, pricing on the dollars tightened to 300bp over Libor, at 99.875 OID from launch guidance of 325bp over Libor at 99.5 OID.
The increase in dollar loans pushed senior leverage slightly higher to 4.98 times from 4.89 times, while total leverage on the deal remained the same at 6.23 times, the sources said.
BIG TEST
With around 80 investors taking varying size tickets in the loans, Flora captured a vast amount of liquidity from both CLOs and managed accounts, the sources said.
While the US market is significantly bigger, this deal is likely to fuel confidence in bankers and borrowers that a large amount of liquidity can be raised in euros and sterling from European investors.
“Raising €2.8bn-equivalent is probably about as big as it gets in the European market. In order to get that amount done, more was raised so a borrower could most probably raise a bit more with generous pricing but would top out at around €3bn-€3.5bn,” a senior banker said.
Pricing on the euros and sterling is set to close in line with initial guidance of 350bp over Euribor and 400bp over Libor, respectively. There is also a €475m-equivalent zloty tranche that is slightly smaller than the €500m-equivalent initially guided but it closed in line with initial pricing guidance of 350bp over Wibor.
The senior unsecured bonds, which now total €994m from €1.050bn, are yet to launch.
POWER OF KKR
KKR agreed to buy the unit, which includes the brands Becel, Flora, Country Crock and Blue Band, for €6.83bn, it was announced in December.
A large number of investors bought the loan thanks to KKR's track record in carve outs and turnarounds. It led investors to buy into the private equity firm’s growth story for the unit.
“Investors either believed KKR’s vision or they didn’t. It is a big business and there are inevitable carve out risks but in terms of sponsors they have good experience,” a senior investor said.
The unit is also highly cash generative, so whether investors believe in the equity story or not, many felt comfortable investing on a senior debt basis.
“It is not completely straight forward as a credit and there are things you have to get comfortable with. To a large extent investors are buying into KKR and their ability to improve the business in a reasonably tough market. But it is good for investors as it is cash generative so the senior debt looks pretty solid,” a second senior investor said.
A number of other investors took tickets on the basis that the loan is big and their portfolios needed diversity and exposure to the paper, which is expected to be highly liquid and one of the main flow names in the secondary loan market.
DECLINED TO PLAY
A few investors took issue with the loan and decided not to play, either because they didn’t believe in the business case or because they didn’t agree with aggressive documentation features such as the ability to repay the sub-debt first.
“It is over-levered with not enough equity from KKR, and the term sheet was terrible. One clause they wanted [enables] the repayment of the junior debt before the senior, which just totally goes against the principle of senior-junior lending,” a third senior investor said.
A fourth investor added: “Developed markets are declining, people are cooking less and eating less bread. We don’t expect a hockey stick recovery and it runs totally contrary to the macro-trend of eating less animal-based products. They talked a lot about improving the image of product, and mentioned how annoying it is that butter is thought of as much healthier.”
While documentation was seen as aggressive, the ability to repay the junior debt -- that has also featured on other loans recently -- is unlikely to be used in this instance, given the expensive call-protection that will offered on the bonds, one of the sources said.
ALLOCATION
The covenant-lite term loans are all offered with a 0% floor and are set to allocate on Wednesday at 99.875 OID on the dollars and 99.5 OID on the euros, sterling and zloty. They are all offered with 101 soft-call protection for six months.
The loans pay a ticking fee of 50% of the interest margin between 45-90 days and the full margin thereafter. They pay nothing up to 45 days.
The financing also includes a €700m 6.5-year revolving credit facility, paying 300bp over Euribor with a 0% floor.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and KKR Capital Markets led the debt financing, along with  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) on the dollar tranche.

The loans were issued through Sigma Bidco BV and Sigma US Corp.
The company is holding off the bond launch for now, despite the fact that often bonds will launch towards the end of a loan syndication process in order that both instruments allocate at the same time.
“The bond info is not ready yet. Because it is a carve out they are waiting for the right audited numbers. The deal is also not closing until the close of Q2 so there is no rush to issue the bonds into escrow and pay them,” the senior banker said.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 11:42AM ET</span>",India set to cut Monsanto's GM cotton seed royalties by 20 percent: sources,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is likely to impose another cut to  Monsanto  (N:MON) royalties paid by domestic companies for its genetically modified (GM) cotton seeds, industry and government sources said.
The latest reduction risks another row with the U.S. company, the world's biggest seed maker, which threatened to leave India in 2016 when the government cut its royalties by more than 70 percent.
This time the government plans to reduce royalties by 20.4 percent to compensate Indian seed makers and also plans to cut prices of GM cotton seeds to help farmers whose fields have been ravaged by pest attacks, the sources said.
The government will finalize its decision soon, the sources said without giving precise timescale.
A Monsanto spokesman said he wasn't aware of any such government order.
The government is expected to lower the prices of GM cotton seeds by 7.5 percent to 740 Indian rupee ($11) for a packet of 450 grams, according to the industry and government sources, who asked not to be identified.
Farmers buy GM cotton seeds from Indian seedmakers who pay to use Monsanto's proprietary technology to produce them.
Cotton seed prices have come down drastically in the past few years, but fuel, labor and supply chain costs have risen sharply, squeezing margins of most seed makers, said Kalyan Goswami, director general of the National Seed Association of India producers' body.
Seed prices need to go up to sustain the GM cotton business in India, Goswami added.
More than 90 percent of India's cotton crop is genetically modified. Last year the government kept both the royalties and the retail prices of GM cotton seeds unchanged.
In 2017/18 India's cotton output is set to rise by 9.3 percent but still short of the record high predicted by industry analysts because boll worm caused damage in some regions.
New Delhi approved the first GM cotton seed trait in 2003 and an upgraded variety in 2006, helping to transform the country into the world's top producer and second-largest exporter of the fiber.

The company's shares rose 7.3 percent to $22.90 in premarket trading on Wednesday.
The Abercrombie brand posted a 5 percent rise in same-store sales, beating analysts' average estimate of 2.13 percent, signaling a turnaround for the company that redefined teen apparel in the 1990s with its risqué advertising and its large logo on clothes.
Chief Executive Fran Horowitz said in January that the Abercrombie brand was on track to deliver positive comparable sales for the quarter.
Same-store sales at the company's beach-themed clothing brand Hollister rose 11 percent. Analysts had expected a 10.35 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Total comparable store sales rose 9 percent, beating the average expectation of a 7.4 percent rise.
Net income attributable to Abercrombie rose to $74.2 million, or $1.05 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, from $48.8 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.38 per share, and reported a 15 percent rise in revenue to $1.19 billion.

Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.10 per share and revenue of $1.16 billion in the reported quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Flewitt said in June that he thought the firm would ""do something like an IPO (initial public offering)"" in the following three to five years.
But a day later the company announced Ron Dennis, McLaren's chairman, was stepping down from his role at the brand and selling his shares, ending a 37-year relationship. 
Flewitt said that since then there had been a rethink from the remaining shareholders, who include Bahrain's Mumtalakat Holding Company and TAG Group, a firm led by Saudi-born businessman Mansour Ojjeh. 
""They're not looking now for an exit so I certainly don't see an IPO in three to five years,"" Flewitt said during an interview at the Geneva Motor Show.

""Right now, all the conversation is around how do we grow the business ... for the good of the combined shareholder group,"" he said.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 12:38PM ET</span>","Dollar Tree same-store sales, forecast disappoint; shares fall","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Discount store operator  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR) on Wednesday reported disappointing holiday-quarter sales and issued a full-year profit forecast that was below expectations, as it spends more, sending its shares down as much as 16 percent.
Driver shortages in the trucking industry coupled with rising wages for hourly retail workers in a tight labor market, have increased costs for brick-and-mortar retail chains, which are already pouring a lot of money into their online business.
Focusing on customer service as a tool to one-up Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) has also forced many retailers to pay hourly workers higher wages or dole out bonuses, denting profits further.
Dollar Tree said it would spend $100 million of the benefit from a new corporate tax law to raise wages of hourly workers, give them more work hours and offer paid maternity leave for some employees, joining similar moves made by Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT).
But as a result, rising wage actions and freight costs would hurt full-year profits by $68 million, the company said on a call.
""We expect continued pressure on store payroll based on state's increasing minimum wages and general average hourly rate increases. We have budgeted higher freight costs and diesel costs than a year ago,"" Chief Financial Officer Kevin Wampler said on a post-earnings call.
For the full-year, Dollar Tree expects a profit of $5.25 to $5.60 per share, much lower than the average analysts' estimate of $5.90 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The Chesapeake, Virginia-based company also reported same-store sales for the key holiday season that missed estimates, as shoppers did not spend as much as expected at its stores.
Analysts had expected sales to get a boost from the pay rises and one-off bonus payments that many companies have given to blue collar workers — Dollar Tree's core customers — as a result of windfalls from changes to U.S. corporate tax rates.
The company's results come a week after biggest rival Walmart Inc (N:WMT) reported a sharp drop in profit and online sales growth during the holiday period.
Net income more than tripled to $1.04 billion, or $4.37 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, mainly due to a $583.7 million benefit from changes in the U.S. tax code.

Excluding items, Dollar Tree earned $1.89 per share, while net sales rose 13 percent to $6.36 billion, both missing estimates.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended slightly lower after Wednesday's volatile session as investors struggled to get a read on U.S. trade policy after President Donald Trump promised hefty import tariffs but then said Mexico and Canada could be exempt. 
After falling as much as 0.97 percent, the S&P regained ground after the White House appeared to add exceptions to its stated plan to slap import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.
Worries about a potential trade war had intensified after free trade supporter Gary Cohn resigned from his position as Trump's top economic advisor late Tuesday.
But late on Wednesday White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump is expected to sign something by the end of the week with ""potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well""
""It makes investors less worried if the tariff isn't applied so broadly. But it's speculation at this point. We have nothing in writing. If there's one thing we've learned from this administration it's that it could change by the time it's in writing,"" Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 82.76 points, or 0.33 percent, to end at 24,801.36, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.32 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,726.8 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 24.64 points, or 0.33 percent, to 7,396.65.
The Dow was dragged down partly by manufacturer stocks such as  Caterpillar  (N:CAT), which fell 1.5 percent, and Boeing (N:BA), which ended 0.5 percent lower. 
Both those stocks have been under pressure since the tariff plan was first announced on Thursday as they could be hurt by both higher metal prices and any retaliatory trade barriers erected by foreign countries where they sell their products.
The S&P energy sector (SPNY) was one of the weakest of the S&P's 11 sectors with a 0.8 percent drop as it was also weighed down by a 2 percent drop in oil prices (CLc1) from data showing a rise in U.S. inventories and output. [O/R] 
The Russell 2000 index (RUT), which tracks U.S. small-cap stocks, outperformed the larger-cap indexes with a 0.8 percent gain. Its more domestically focused companies are seen as having less exposure if foreign governments retaliate by slapping tariffs on U.S. exports.
The S&P's technology index (SPLRCT) was also a bright spot with a 0.6 percent increase. Its biggest boosts came from a 2.2 percent increase in Facebook (O:FB) and a 14.9 percent jump in shares of software supplier Autodesk (O:ADSK) after its quarterly report.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.68-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 147 new highs and 19 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was roughly 6.74 billion shares, compared to the 7.79 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Nestle (S:NESN) veteran Helmut Maucher, who turned the Swiss-based company into the world's biggest food group during his almost 20-year leadership, has died at the age of 90, the company said on Wednesday.
Maucher, a German who joined the company as a commercial apprentice and later became chief executive and chairman, passed away at his home in Bad Homburg, Germany on Monday, Nestle said in a statement.
""Helmut Maucher was a highly esteemed and charismatic personality, a strong and visionary leader, who dedicated so much of his life to Nestle,"" Nestle Chairman Paul Bulcke said in the statement.
Known for being outspoken, Maucher boosted the company's sales through a series of aggressive acquisitions in the 1980s.
Maucher joined Nestle as an apprentice at the Nestle factory in Eisenharz, his home town in southwestern Germany, and held several management positions in Germany before transferring to Nestle's Swiss headquarters in 1980.
He was named chief executive in 1981, at the height of a dispute over Nestle's marketing of infant formula in developing countries.
Under the old-school manager's leadership, Nestle added Carnation milk and Buitoni pasta to its brand portfolio, and went ahead with the contested takeover of British firm Rowntree, the maker of KitKat and Smarties, in the late 1980s.

From 1990 to 1997, he simultaneously held the jobs of CEO and chairman. He retained the latter position until 2000 when he reached mandatory retirement age and was named honorary chairman.

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) has put more than a dozen UK-based banking, sales and trading staff on notice to move to Frankfurt within weeks, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, as it braces for divorce between Britain and the European Union.
After months of patience and private lobbying, the U.S. investment bank has decided it can no longer wait for clarity from lawmakers on how its business might be impacted by Britain's exit from the trading bloc and is taking the steps to minimize disruption to clients.
It has informed members of its London-based derivatives and debt capital markets teams working on German accounts that their activities will be relocated to its base in Frankfurt and to make the necessary preparations to move to those offices by end-June, the sources told Reuters.
Several members of those teams have already negotiated and signed new German employment contracts, one of the sources added. Goldman declined to comment.
Goldman's decision to reissue some staff contracts and set a timeline to move teams to the continent marks one of the first tangible signs that banks are starting to execute on Brexit contingency plans after British Prime Minister Theresa May ruled out retaining passporting rights for financial services.
The loss of these passporting rights - which currently enable finance firms to freely offer financial, advisory and trading services to corporate clients across all EU states via just one local license - is a key concern for banks such as Goldman.
It is unclear how deeply the loss of those privileges will affect London-based bankers, but Goldman felt that an initial relocation of a small number of staff providing such services was the best way to protect clients, one of the sources said.
The bank has been looking to expand its workforce in Frankfurt to 400, a third source said, as part of a strategy to increase its presence more broadly across the continent. 
Jens Hofmann will assume responsibility for the bank's Financing Group activities for Germany, Austria and Switzerland and will relocate to Frankfurt from London, the third source said. 
The imminent relocations are set to ring alarm bells among British financial regulators hoping that banks will hold back on any ""irreversible"" steps, given that Britain and the EU aim to agree a transition deal this month to keep business as usual between Brexit Day on March 29, 2019 until the end of 2020.
PRIMARY DEALERS
Banking sources said last year that EU officials could impose rules to require investment banks to move positions from London to continental Europe if they want to retain their role as primary dealers for EU governments after Brexit. 
Primary dealers help national governments manage their borrowing by buying bonds from them in auctions and selling these on to investors. It's high-profile work that helps banks win other public and private sector business in those countries. 
In January, the president of  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), Colm Kelleher, said his bank would make its decisions about redeploying staff ""very early this year"".
Goldman Sachs backed the ill-fated campaign for Britain to remain in the EU, arguing that the UK's thriving financial services industry and the two million people it employs would be significant casualties of Britain's decision to leave.
Since the 2016 vote, the bank has reiterated its commitment to London and pledged to keep its primary European base in the UK irrespective of the nature of Brexit.

It is midway through a multi-million pound development of a new headquarters building in London and, like other U.S. investment banks, continues to recruit more staff in the capital than anywhere else in Europe.

Sinopec (SS:600028) Vice President Ma Yongsheng said the central government should subsidize the construction of underground gas storage, LNG tanks and other facilities. 
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL] President Wang Yilin urged the government to refund value added tax on LNG imports to lower gas costs for consumers. 
Members of parliament and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Communist Party's largely ceremonial advisory body, are encouraged to submit suggestions for future legislation during the current Parliament session.
Their chances of becoming legislation are minimal, but they can form part of future laws. 
The proposals from Sinopec and CNPC come as the nation looks for ways to increase storage capacity for natural gas to avoid a repeat of this past winter's heating crisis. 
Millions of households in northern China switched from using coal to natural gas for heating ahead of this past winter, leading to sky-rocketing gas consumption as well shortages across many regions. 
The fuel shortages over the last three or four months deepened China's worries over whether it can secure enough gas and LNG supplies in winters ahead. 
CNPC's Wang said China's gas demand will grow 15 to 16 percent in 2018 and supplies will continue to be tight, according to a transcript of his speech to a parliament meeting session published in CNPC's official newspaper. 
Sinopec's Kong Fanqun, who heads the Shengli Oil field said a lack of storage facilities also contributed to China's gas shortages this winter, according to a transcript of his speech sent to Reuters by the Sinopec Group. 
The country needs an additional 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) of storage facilities by 2020 to meet its own demand, Kong said. That is five times the size of China's current gas storage facilities. 
Kong asked the government to give gas producers subsidies as well tax breaks to build and operate gas storage facilities.

Both Sinopec and CNPC officials also proposed removing resource taxes on the development of shale gas, coalbed methane, high sulfur gas and tight gas reserves.

RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has directed the Saudi government to resolve a dispute with banks facing higher Islamic tax liabilities, banking sources say, in an attempt to avoid any damage to his push to diversify the economy.
It follows disclosures by major Saudi banks in recent weeks that the government's General Authority of Zakat and Tax (GAZT) is asking them for additional payments of zakat - the name of the tax - for years going back as far as 2002. In some cases, the demands exceed half of a bank's annual net profit.
Banks are contesting the extra payments, which are estimated at around 9.8 billion riyals ($2.6 billion) across 11 of the kingdom's 12 listed banks.
Analysts have warned the liabilities could hurt liquidity at the banks, the majority of which are main financiers of the budget deficit through purchases of local bonds.
They would also restrict banks' ability to lend to the private sector, a key element in the government's reform plan to move the economy away from reliance on oil and create jobs for hundreds of thousands of unemployed Saudis.
A committee with representatives from GAZT, the central bank and other parties was recently formed to look into the issue at the behest of the crown prince, widely known by his initials MbS, the sources told Reuters.
The committee, chaired by former central bank governor Fahad al-Mubarak, currently an adviser to the Royal Court, has handed its recommendations to the court and they could be announced as soon as in the next few weeks, one of the sources said.
Prince Mohammed begins a visit to Britain on Wednesday and is expected to travel to the United States later this month.
Although Saudi banks and other firms generally do not pay corporate tax, they are subject to zakat, a 2.5 percent levy on each bank's net worth.
Lenders and the authorities have been at loggerheads over the amount of zakat they pay for more than a decade. But the dispute has captured more attention from investors recently as the kingdom seeks to attract billions of dollars of foreign investment from global equity indexes in the next couple of years.
Bankers say the way the tax is calculated is opaque and the heavy financial demands on banks threaten the stability of the banking sector and capital markets.
""MbS is keen on maintaining the banking sector's solid position ... He is aware of the economic challenges and wants to make sure banks will continue to be able to support the economy and the private sector,"" said one banker.
Central bank officials were not immediately available for comment, and neither GAZT nor the government media office responded to an emailed request for comment. 
Another banker said a quick resolution of the issue was urgently needed.
""This comes at a very bad time, while authorities are trying to promote the capital markets and are discussing global indices inclusion. There is a high interest to fix this issue before the end of March, ahead of FTSE inclusion decision,"" he said.
Saudi Arabia is hoping to earn emerging market status in 2018 from index providers FTSE and MSCI, moves that EFG Hermes forecasts will attract up to $45 billion in total foreign inflows.
Banks argue that Saudi government bonds should not be included in fixed assets subject to zakat, as this is not in line with international best practices.

Saudi scholars at GAZT have long decided that all types of government bonds are seen as a security that does not entail risk, and hence should be subject to zakat, said one banker, who described the move as a ""very narrow view of the way the banking sector works.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Tianjin, a major port city in North China, said it would hold ""lazy"" officials accountable for any dent to the pace of its economic expansion, even as the central government pledged to pursue quality over quantity with respect to growth.
Battling weak economic growth, which was the smallest among all municipalities and provinces last year, Tianjin will step up a campaign to name and punish officials who fail to fulfill their responsibilities and deliver in the next three years, the city's Commission for Discipline Inspection Chief Deng Xiuming said.
Thousands were punished last year, he told reporters late on Tuesday on the sidelines of the annual meeting of parliament, without providing details on punishments.
Earlier this week, Premier Li Keqiang said China aimed to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent, unchanged from 2017, and omitted previous wording that growth could be ""higher if possible"" - indicating Beijing's attention remains fixed on credit risks and better-quality growth.
Amid China's war on pollution, crackdown on risky financing and a cooling property market, Tianjin's growth hit 3.6 percent in 2017, versus 9 percent in 2016, putting the city in a tight spot as it faces additional tasks such as President Xi Jinping's initiative to eliminate extreme poverty by 2020.
Tianjin Party Chief Li Hongzhong said the city would stick to its zero tolerance for polluting industries, and could no longer rely on old industries, an infrastructure building spree and real estate for growth. 
The city, home to more than 15 million people, must depend on the ""fighting spirit"" and diligence of its cadres, he said. 
Seeking to ease possible concerns that such measures would imply lesser efforts to hit economic targets, Li added: ""Higher-quality growth does absolutely not mean small amount of development and low-speed growth."" 
The city is aiming for a 5 percent GDP growth in 2018.
To ensure officials are doing their work, Discipline Inspection Chief Deng said Tianjin will treat the campaign as a ""revolution"" that would involve constant self-inspection, open investigations and secret interviews and background checks.

Looking to be a high-tech manufacturing and logistics hub, it currently hosts production centers for foreign aviation giant Airbus (PA:AIR) and data storage centers for Chinese technology firms such as Tencent (HK:0700).

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The chief executive of India's  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) (NS:PNBK) met officials of the serious fraud office on Wednesday, as authorities widened a probe into a $2 billion fraud that has been billed as the country's biggest banking scam.
Sunil Mehta's appearance before the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) follows its meeting with executives of at least two other banks on Tuesday. 
PNB did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the SFIO probe.
In the fraud at PNB which was first disclosed by the bank in February, the lender and police have accused some bank employees of colluding with two jeweler groups which raised credit from overseas banks based on fraudulent guarantees issued by rogue PNB staff.
Police have also so far arrested 19 people including eight of PNB's current and former employees, along with executives from jeweler Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi's companies.
Executives from private sector lenders ICICI Bank (NS:ICBK) and  Axis Bank  (NS:AXBK) met with the SFIO on Tuesday, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
In a statement to the stock exchange late on Tuesday, Axis said the SFIO had sought information from it on the accounts of Nirav Modi and Choksi's Gitanjali group of companies. 
ICICI Bank also told the stock exchange on Tuesday its executives continue to ""engage actively and provide requisite inputs"" to investigative authorities, without commenting on Tuesday's meeting.
Indian authorities including the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate have conducted extensive searches and questioned people in connection with the PNB fraud.
Both Choksi and Modi have denied the allegations and lawyers for the two key accused PNB employees in the case have also said they are innocent.
A source and documents reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday showed the amount involved in the fraud is likely to rise beyond the $2 billion mark.

Shares in Punjab National Bank (NS:PNBK) fell as much as 3.9 percent on Wednesday, tumbling for a fourth straight session. PNB has lost more than 40 percent of its market capitalization since disclosing the fraud last month.

65,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",China's Shiniest Tech Stars May Ignite a Feeding Frenzy at Home,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s push to get its fastest-growing companies to list shares at home could trigger a feeding frenzy from investors chasing the flashiest securities in a market dominated by old-economy stalwarts.
Beijing is trying to stem an exodus to American markets -- and that’s good news for U.S. investors as it may bring a valuation boost. From  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. to Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU)., the country’s brightest tech stars have for years chosen to debut in New York despite once-richer valuations at home, drawn to abundant capital and the prestige of a marquee international listing. But executives say Beijing is now pondering regulatory changes to catch the next wave of debutantes like Xiaomi Corp., while helping U.S.-listed companies create Chinese Depositary Receipts to tap trillions of dollars in domestic savings.
Officials haven’t divulged specifics or even what a CDR would look like. But this week, the chief executives of Baidu, Netease Inc. and 58.com Inc. were among those who expressed interest. Xiaomi is now said to be considering a mainland listing as part of a much-anticipated 2018 coming-out party. The stock exchange in the southern city of Shenzhen is said to fast-tracking tech IPOs in 2018. Regulators have even reached out to Alibaba and Hong Kong-listed Tencent Holdings Ltd., Caixin reported, together worth almost $1 trillion.
However it shapes up, the process is likely to transform the country’s stock markets by hiking tech sector representation. Companies that choose CDRs may enjoy higher valuations because of a paucity of celebrated names, and because the individuals that make up four-fifths of trading will back brands they know.
Consider: artificial intelligence play iFlytek Co. trades at 156 times earnings -- several times the U.S. market average. When security business Qihoo 360 delisted from the U.S. and re-floated in Shanghai as 360 Security Technology Inc., its value leapt more than five times. Hong Kong-traded PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd. changes hands at a two-year earnings multiple of about 10 times: a third the valuation of Shenzhen-listed rival Inspur Electronic Information Industry Co.
“The U.S. ADRs are relatively the best companies in China and the domestic listed companies have much less quality, so you’re going to see a higher valuation,” said Blue Lotus Capital Advisor Ltd. founder Eric Wen. “This is also a good way for Chinese citizens to enjoy the growth of these companies without converting their RMB into U.S. dollars, which the government doesn’t like.”

Regulators first need to untangle issues both legal and financial before going ahead with the idea, MCM Partners senior analyst Ryan Roberts said. “The market in China is just not as mature as the U.S.,” he said.
But Beijing wants to address what it views as a severe imbalance, at a time Xi Jinping is hawking the “China Dream”: a concept that embodies the country’s ascendancy and the privileges it confers upon citizens. The courtship coincides with an effort by Hong Kong to also rework regulations to enhance its attraction to the tech sector.
It’s galling to the government that there’re just nine tech companies worth more than $10 billion on local exchanges -- versus 78 in the U.S.
Chinese investors -- for whom dabbling in stocks is akin to a national pastime -- now have no easy way to share in the record-breaking growth of the consumer internet because buying U.S. securities is near-impossible for them. Alibaba has surged 170 percent since its 2014 IPO, but most locals haven’t gone along for the ride.
Tech companies of $10 billion value or more trade in Shanghai and Shenzhen at about 80 times historical earnings, about 50 percent higher than their U.S. peers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apart from the mania that China’s biggest names are likely to inspire, that too suggests tech corporations can command a premium.
“Think about it: 900 plus million people who use WeChat on a daily basis have a limited exposure to Tencent, or the 400 plus million people who use Alibaba on a monthly basis don’t have a way to buy it,” said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer for Krane Funds Advisors in New York. “An advance in the local market will be supportive of the valuations in the U.S.”

67,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 08:21AM ET</span>",Trump tariffs would barely raise Boeing's prices but could hurt sales,"By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's plan to slap tariffs on imported steel and aluminum would barely budge the price of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co jetliner or fighter plane, belying fears of a big blow to U.S. industry, aerospace analysts said.
What could have an impact is retaliation by countries such as China, one of Boeing's biggest customers, if the United States goes through with threats to tax imported steel by 25 percent and aluminum by 10 percent, they said.
As one of the world's largest manufacturers, Boeing provides a window into how double-digit tariffs on raw materials would translate into just a fractional uptick in the cost of finished goods. Boeing makes its planes exclusively in the United States, but nearly 70 percent of the 763 jetliners delivered last year went to customers outside the United States and 22 percent went to China.
Aluminum makes up 80 percent of the weight of older model planes such as the 737 and 777 but only about 12 percent of the cost, according to several experts with direct knowledge of Boeing. The rest is labor, overhead and other expenses.
For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2oPA3Xf
A 10 percent aluminum tariff would increase the cost of a plane by about 1.2 percent if all of the aluminum is imported. But most of the aluminum Boeing uses is domestically produced, experts said.
""These are big chunks of aluminum that are expensive to transport,"" said Eric Redifer, a director in the aerospace practice of industry consulting firm AlixPartners.
He and others estimate only 25 percent to 30 percent is imported, leaving a net impact of about 0.3 percent of a plane's cost.
Prices of domestic aluminum are likely to rise if tariffs are imposed, although it is unclear how much.
On a mid-sized 737, with a list price of $117.1 million, the cost increase could be less than $200,000, because airlines often receive discounts of 40 percent off list price, and Boeing's profit margin is about 10 percent.
Boeing declined to comment. 
The net effect for steel is similar, even though it makes up less of a typical Boeing plane, said Kevin Michaels, aerospace manufacturing expert at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consulting firm in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 
He estimated Trump's 25 percent tariff on relatively pricey steel would cost U.S. aerospace companies less than $100 million, roughly on par with the overall impact on aluminum. That means the two tariffs would add $150 million to $200 million in cost, or at most about 0.2 percent of $100 billion worth of business jets, jetliners and military aircraft U.S. companies make each year.
For Boeing's newer 787, which uses carbon-fiber composite for wings and fuselage, the impact is even less. Aluminum makes up 10 percent of the cost, Redifer said. The result: Trump's aluminum tariff would increase 787 costs about 0.09 percent.
""What will have a material impact is if China retaliates,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. ""They are openly searching for ways to express their displeasure and apply leverage. And it doesn't get any more obvious that going from Boeing to Airbus."" 

The country's thirst for jets is so great, however, that it likely will need planes from both Boeing and European rival Airbus to keep up with demand, analysts said.

White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn announced his resignation on Tuesday. While Cohn did not mention the disputes in his statement, he reportedly quit just hours after a confrontation with U.S. president Trump over his tariffs plan. Following Cohn’s announcement, the White House said it was considering to impose wider curbs on China and clamp down on Chinese investment in the U.S.
Overnight, the Dow gained 0.04%, the S&P 500 added 0.26%, and the Nasdaq was up 0.5%.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 closed 0.7% lower at the close, as yen strengthened after the U.S. showed mixed signals about whether Trump would follow through with his tariff proposals. Bank of Japan’s monetary policy decision and briefing are due this Friday.
China’s National People’s Congress continued to remain in focus, as the country’s finance minister Xiao Jie said on the third day of the event that the country would continue to cut tax and pledge tax cut of $126 billion, on top of extending tax breaks to small and medium sized enterprises. Xiao also noted that China would strictly punish debt issuance chaos to ensure there are no systematic debt risks in the country. The Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component opened higher but both fell into the red later in the day, down 0.3% and 0.6% respectively by 1:30am ET.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index extended its losses from the morning, reversed some of its 600 points gains yesterday and slipped 1.2%. Hong Kong-listed mainland lenders outperformed the region as Chinese regulators were reportedly moving to ease lenders’ provisions toward bad loans.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.5%, after gaining close to 1% in the morning after North Korea indicated that it would consider giving up nuclear weapons if the regime's safety is guaranteed. Trump signaled he was open to talks with North Korea following the comments.
Elsewhere, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropped for the fifth time in six sessions and fell 1.01% to end the day at 5,902 after the country reported a slower-than-expected GDP growth of 0.4% in the December quarter, compared to the general consensus of an increase of 0.5%. The economic growth was reportedly undermined by weaker construction and exports.

This comes at a time when Indonesia is trying to join the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an inter-governmental body that is fighting money laundering globally. The country was put on an FATF list of jurisdictions with weak measures to combat money laundering and terrorism financing in 2012. 
While it was taken off the list in 2015 due to progress in improving regulations, it is yet to become an FATF member. 
""Corporations could be used as a means, either directly or indirectly, by a beneficial owner who conducted money laundering and terrorism financing, as long as there is no regulation on it. So it is necessary to regulate the principle of recognizing the beneficial owner of a corporation,"" a copy of the new regulation shows.
All companies, foundations, limited partnerships and other types of corporations must disclose at least one person as their beneficial owner upon registering for business, the regulation, signed by President Joko Widodo on March 1, stated.
Those already in operation must also reveal such details to authorities within a year. 
Tax authorities can also use the data to identify new tax subjects and to audit tax reports, said Yustinus Prastowo, executive director of Center for Indonesia Taxation Analysis.

The ownership data must be updated at least once every year and is open to public upon request.

The report, entitled ""Don't bank on the bomb"", found that 22 financial institutions comprehensively prevented any involvement in nuclear weapon producing companies in 2017, up from 18 in 2016 and 13 in 2015.
The new names included Norway's Government Pension Fund, Australia's Future Super, U.S.-based fund manager Green Century and Denmark's MP Pension, which manages pensions for Danish academics.
There were a further 41 institutions that excluded nuclear weapon producers from their investments, but whose policy was not all-inclusive, up from 36 in 2016 and 40 in 2015.
The report was published by Dutch Christian campaign group PAX and the Geneva-based International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017.
""By divesting from nuclear weapon producers, we can make it harder for those that profit from weapons of mass destruction and encourage them to cut the production of nuclear weapons from their business strategies,"" ICAN's executive director Beatrice Fihn wrote in the introduction to the report.
The report found that 329 banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers from 24 countries invested significantly in the top 20 firms involved in nuclear weapons, such as Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT),  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD).
Of the $525 billion invested, $81 billion more than a year previously, more than half came from the top 10 investors, all U.S.-based, led by Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), Capital Group and Vanguard, the report said.
The report examined firms involved in producing key components for the nuclear arsenals of France, India, Britain and the United States.
The maintenance and modernization of nuclear forces in other nuclear-armed countries, listed as China, North Korea, Israel, Pakistan and Russia, was done mainly or exclusively by the government, it said.

By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citadel, one of the world's largest hedge fund managers, has cut staff by more than 30 percent in one of its stock-picking units in what several people with direct knowledge of the layoffs described as a surprise move.
From late February through Monday, 49 people had lost their jobs at the firm's two-year-old Aptigon business. They include portfolio managers, analysts, associates and other ancillary staff, according to four people who were not authorized to speak publicly about internal Citadel matters.
That shrinks Aptigon's headcount by roughly 34 percent, one of the biggest hedge fund downsizings in recent times, industry investors said. More than a dozen people from Aptigon have been reassigned to other positions in the firm, the sources said.
""We changed the leadership of Aptigon Capital because the prior leadership had failed to demonstrate it could generate the performance we expect from a Citadel business. We are committed to the success of Aptigon and will continue to recruit leading talent to the team,"" Citadel spokesman Zia Ahmed said.
Ahmed declined further comment.
The departure of industry veteran Richard Schimel, who was wooed to Citadel by its founder Ken Griffin in 2016 after Schimel ran Diamondback Capital and Sterling Ridge Capital, was reported by several news outlets on Feb. 22. 
But the cuts have also included money managers Rob Stenhouse, Matt Dublin, Jon Greenbaum and Brett Caughran, as well as executives David Bonfili and Keith Brenner, the sources said. They declined to comment for this article.
The cuts came as a surprise because Aptigon is a relatively new business that Citadel had been pouring resources into and many of the portfolio managers had recently begun to put money to work.
Aptigon manages money for Citadel's main multi-strategy Kensington and Wellington funds which returned 13 percent last year. Aptigon was flat last year, several people with knowledge of the numbers said. 
Citadel changed direction at Aptigon because its goal is to deliver consistently strong returns, Ahmed said. More than two-thirds of the Aptigon portfolio managers lost money during their time at Citadel, he added.
But some were puzzled that Griffin, who signed off on all of the hires, moved so quickly on experienced managers Citadel spent millions of dollars to lure from prominent firms.
""We were only beginning to put capital to work last year and if performance metrics had been an issue, I would have thought there would have been conversations and warnings,"" said one former portfolio manager. ""But that didn't happen."" 
Several sources said there seemed to be growing friction between Griffin and Schimel as the two men had very different styles and Schimel was trying to trying to build a collaborative culture at Aptigon.
Aptigon's launch was the first time that Chicago-based Citadel, which manages $27 billion, established a major presence in Connecticut, home to many rival hedge funds including Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management. The business also had an office in San Francisco, which is now closed, sources said.
Schimel, who had worked for Cohen early in his career, was brought on board in mid-2016 to build a new multi-sector global equity unit from scratch. Earlier in 2016, Citadel cut roughly a dozen people at another of its stock picking units Surveyor Capital and last year it shut down another stock unit, Ravelin, and merged it into its Global Equities unit.
Many of Aptigon's portfolio managers came from Visium Asset Management, which was going out of business in the summer of 2016 and had more than a dozen portfolio managers ready to move to a rival firm. Griffin made them lucrative offers, including pay packages and promised cash to hire analysts, and touted Citadel’s state-of-the-art trading technology, the sources said.
Of the original group of portfolio managers who moved over from Visium only two remain with Citadel, the sources said.
Some of Schimel's hires, who generally had not been at Citadel for more than a year, are still with Citadel however.
Neel Parekh, who shut down his Night Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital to join Aptigon, and Chris Connor, who closed down Ardmore Global Investors to join, also remain. Recent recruits Noah Yosha, who once worked for HealthCor Management, and energy investor John Meloy, who came from Balyasny Asset Management, are also still with Citadel.

While home-grown automakers Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors Corp dominate the local market, high-end German vehicles have made inroads in recent years with more diverse offerings for brand-conscious consumers.
BMW saw the biggest jump with February sales nearly doubling to 6,118 vehicles, industry data showed. That was just a tad behind Mercedes which led the imported car rankings with 6,192 cars, up 12 percent from the same period a year earlier.
South Korea last year became the sixth biggest market for Mercedes, climbing from eighth place.
GM's announcement last month that it plans to shut down of one of its four factories in South Korea and was weighing the fate of the three other plants resulted in domestic retail sales nearly halving in February to 5,804.
With consumers worried about loss of after-care services and residual value, GM lost its long-held spot as South Korea's No. 3 automaker, slipping to sixth place.
The U.S automaker, whose South Korean operations are primarily geared toward exports, is seeking financial aid from Seoul as well as concessions on wages and benefits from its local union to stay operating in the country.
Talks with the labor union on Wednesday failed to produce concrete results although some 2,500 workers have applied for voluntary redundancy package.
""We hope to wrap up talks with the labor union and the government swiftly,"" a GM Korea spokesman said.
""A drawn-out restructuring will hurt consumer trust,"" he added.

NEW YORK/DUBAI (Reuters) - Embattled private equity firm Abraaj has begun freeing large investors from millions of dollars in capital commitments after deciding to suspend its new fund, the Dubai-based asset manager said. 
The move underscores the impact on Abraaj's business from a dispute with four other investors over the use of their money in a separate $1 billion healthcare fund. 
""Abraaj has voluntarily released investors from their commitments in Abraaj Private Equity Fund VI, and no longer intends to proceed with this Fund in its current form,"" the firm said in a statement to Reuters. 
Washington State Investment Board (WSIB) and the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana withdrew a combined $300 million commitment made to the new fund, which was looking to raise $6 billion. The fund had its first close of $3 billion last year.  
It is the first time investors have come out with their views about Abraaj's new fund. 
Since the dispute broke earlier this year, Abraaj has shaken up its management, suspended new investment activities and undertaken an independent review of its corporate structure, focusing on governance and control functions.
""In light of our ongoing re-organization, we believe this is a prudent step and is aligned with our longstanding commitment to investors. Abraaj will restart fundraising discussions with investors once the re-organization and strategic review are complete,"" Abraaj said. 
Chris Phillips, director of institutional relations at WSIB, told Reuters his firm was informed last week by Abraaj that the fund's $250 million commitment, made in June last year, was being released.
""We were notified before any decision was made to withdraw,"" said Phillips. 
The Washington State Investment Board manages investments for 17 retirement plans for public employees, teachers, school employees, law enforcement officers, firefighters and judges, it says on its website. It manages nearly $129 billion in assets.
Maurice Coleman, deputy chief investments officer at the Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana, which manages more than $19 billion, said the firm had ""paused our commitment to Abraaj per their request"".  
Abraaj CEO Arif Naqvi, who founded the firm in 2002 and turned it into an emerging market powerhouse with $13.6 billion in assets, has stepped aside from running of the fund, Abraaj Investment Management Ltd. He will remain chief executive of Abraaj Holdings.
The investors in the healthcare fund are still waiting for the report of forensic accountants Ankura Consulting, which is probing how funds were used in the Abraaj Healthcare Fund. 
The four investors wanted to know why some of their money had not yet been used for the stated purpose of building hospitals and clinics.  
Abraaj had said some capital was not used as quickly as anticipated due to unforeseen political and regulatory developments in several of the markets it operates. After discussion with investors, it had returned the unused capital to all investors in the fund at the end of December 2017.
The high-profile investors include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and World Bank's arm IFC, sources have told Reuters earlier.
Abraaj said on Feb. 7 that auditor KPMG had reviewed and found all such payments and receipts were verified and unused capital was returned to investors. 
The Gates Foundation and IFC have declined to comment on the controversy.

(Reuters) - The top executives of gun maker American Outdoor Brands Corp on Tuesday defended their safety efforts in a letter to asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) posted on the website of the maker of Smith & Wesson guns.
American Outdoor Brands and other gun makers have been under pressure from investors including BlackRock for a response after a high school massacre in Parkland, Florida, last month that killed 17 people.
In the letter, American Outdoor Brands' chairman and chief executive officer said public safety priorities should be to enforce existing laws, improve background checks and address mental health challenges.
""The solution is not to take a politically motivated action that has an adverse impact on our company, our employees, our industry, our shareholders, the economies we support and, significantly, the rights of our law abiding customers, but results in no increase in public safety,"" stated the letter. It is signed by company Chairman Barry Monheit and CEO James Debney.
BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, on Friday said it would press gun makers and weapons retailers in its portfolios to explain how they monitor firearms sales and use, and said it was studying the creation of new index-based portfolios of stocks that would exclude gun makers and retailers.
A BlackRock spokesman on Tuesday said in an e-mail that the firm will continue to engage with firearms makers “to further understand their business policies and practices in order to protect our clients’ investments in them.” 
Other companies and financial firms have also been reviewing ties with the weapons industry and the National Rifle Association in the wake of the shooting, amid calls by some groups for investors to go further and divest the stocks altogether. 
The letter from American Outdoor Brands, and an accompanying eight-page company memo, amount to one of the industry's first detailed defenses of its practices and may guide a debate over what specific changes investors might seek.
American Outdoor said its distributors face restrictions on who they may sell firearms to, and said it works closely with law enforcement agencies to trace guns used in crimes.
""We believe it is important to tell you that we respect the national debate that is currently underway regarding firearms and safety,"" Monheit and Debney wrote.
The company said its investors understand the risks the stock poses. ""We believe that our stockholders are well aware of the products we manufacture and fully understand the risks associated with investing in a firearms manufacturer,"" the memo states.

American Outdoor Brands said it is not opposed to smart gun” systems, but it opposes legislation that would require such technology, “especially when it is not yet proven safe and reliable.”

The number of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission-registered option-based funds and exchange-traded products grew to 157 in 2017, up from 135 at the end of 2014, and the assets managed by these funds grew to a record-high of $54.15 billion, up from $49 billion, three years ago, the Cboe Exchange Inc-funded study, found. U.S. stocks have only recently broken away from a prolonged stretch of muted gyrations that sent some measures of daily price swings to multi-decade lows.

(Reuters) - A lawyer for a student wounded in February's mass shooting at a Florida high school on Monday filed a legal notice of intent to sue the county sheriff's office and the school district for failing to protect the students.
The lawsuit would be the first for the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in which a gunman killed 17 people and wounded or injured more than a dozen others.
The so-called notice of intent to file a claim is required by Florida law before a lawsuit can be brought against government entities.
It would be brought on behalf of 15-year-old Anthony Borges and his family. Borges was shot five times during the massacre, suffering life-threatening injuries, and remains hospitalized, according to the notice.
""The failure of Broward County public schools, and of the principal and school resource officer to adequately protect students, and in particular our client, from life-threatening harm were unreasonable, callous and negligent,"" the family's lawyer, Alex Arreaza, said in the notice.
Arreaza sent the letters to the Boward County administrator, its sheriff's office and the superintendent of its public schools, as well as to the risk management division of Florida's Department of Financial Services.
Representatives of those offices could not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours. 
The notice said the Borges demand damages in an unspecified amount as settlement for the officials' negligent actions.
Law enforcement officials and state employees are generally immune to legal claims over inaction, as courts have held they need to be able to make decisions without fear of liability.
But legal experts have previously said the Broward County Sheriff's Office could be sued over the failure of one of its deputies to enter the high school during the shooting and that plaintiffs might be able to overcome the immunity standard.

Under Florida law, damages awards against state agencies are capped at $300,000 per claimant, but Florida's legislature has the ability to waive those limits in particular cases.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks and the dollar fell on Wednesday after a strong advocate of free trade resigned from the White House, fanning fears that U.S. President Donald Trump will proceed with protectionist tariffs and risk a trade war. 
Economic adviser Gary Cohn, seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces within the Trump administration, said on Tuesday he was leaving, sparking a global sell-off across a number of major asset classes.
MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent, having seen some strength in Asian trading following news that South and North Korea would hold their first summit in more than a decade. 
Equity futures pointed to the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index opening 0.7 percent lower, with Dow Jones futures down 1 percent.
Wall Street's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility index, was up around 8 percent. 
In Europe the continent's car-makers, which face the risk of a hike in import tariffs to the United States, were among the worst performers, falling 0.5 percent. European stocks as a whole recovered some of their early losses to trade down 0.1 percent. 
""The implication is that without the restraining influence of Cohn on Trump, the president will now have a free hand to press ahead with further tariffs and generally up the ante on trade,"" said Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital.
""This in itself does not bode well for risk despite that small boost we saw on news that North Korea could consider de-nuking."" 
RISK AVERSION
Cohn's departure rippled through foreign exchange and commodity markets.
The U.S. dollar fell 0.4 percent against the Japanese yen -- seen a safe-haven in times of uncertainty. 
The dollar is just off a 14-month low against the yen hit on Friday.
""The worst outcome for financial markets, in terms of potential to create volatility, would be a confirmation of rising trade friction and benign neglect of the dollar in the short term,"" said analysts at ANZ.
The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso both retreated by more than 0.5 percent against the dollar as Cohn's departure was seen as raising risks that Washington could walk away from NAFTA negotiations.
Commodities fell on worries that trade friction could slow global growth, with Brent crude futures giving up the previous day's gains to drop 0.5 percent.
Copper on the London Metal Exchange lost 1.2 percent, paring a 1.4 percent gain from the previous session. 
Currencies of commodity producers South Africa and Russia were both down more than 0.5 percent against the dollar, with the rand under particular pressure on falling reserves and business confidence.

European government bonds rallied, with yields across the euro zone falling by 1-3 basis points, following similar strengthening in U.S. Treasuries overnight.

Order books of more than US$120bn for the nine-tranche trade - the third largest US dollar high-grade corporate deal on record, according to IFR data - brought some relief after new issues have traded wider in secondary of late.

CVS had been eyeing other currencies as well due to the large amount of debt it needed to raise. 
But hefty demand for the US dollar offering helped alleviate concerns about investor demand that has tapered off in recent weeks, according to Lipper data.
The asset class, for example, last month saw its biggest weekly outflow since November 2016. Analysts have also warned about wilting demand from foreign investors as hedging costs have risen.
""The market at this juncture still has the capacity to finance large scale transactions,"" said a banker not directly involved in the CVS deal.
BUYSIDE BARGAINING
Some investors, however, cautioned that other would-be borrowers may not find as welcome a reception.
Some, for example, gave CVS credit for the acquisition which will create one of the largest companies in the US by revenue and help cut costs. It could also help the firm resist Amazon’s entry into drug distribution.
""CVS has fundamentally changed its business through this acquisition,"" Janelle Woodward, global co-head of income at BMO Global Asset Management, said.
Brill described the merged entity - the M&A deal is yet to close - as almost a conglomerate.
""It will have multiple sources of revenue, and will be an industry leader in multiple areas,” Brill said.
To win over investors, CVS also offered a steep discount on some of the tranches that include a special mandatory redemption clause.
That clause, offered on every tranche except the 30-year, requires CVS to buy the bonds back from investors at a price of 101 if the merger fails to close by September 3 next year.
Bond buyers hailed the discount as a break-through.
RECORD BOOKS
Still, the huge order book is one of the largest ever recorded in the corporate bond market, according to IFR data.
Mindful of the recent choppy backdrop, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JP Morgan - active bookrunners on the CVS trade - closed books unusually early by 10:30am New York time, and launched it just after midday. 
That strategy also allowed accounts whose orders weren't filled to buy bonds in the secondary market on the same day of pricing, Brill said. The deal was trading tighter in the gray market on Tuesday afternoon after launch.
Relatively generous initial price thoughts on the trade, comprising maturities ranging from two to 30 years, certainly helped turn heads on the buyside from the get go..
IFR calculated new issue concession of between 30bp-40bp across the deal at IPTs stage, based on where outstanding bonds from CVS were trading. The only exceptions were the two and three-year bonds, which began with NICs closer to 15bp-25bp.
But as order books swelled, and leads pulled in spreads, NICs were closer to 10bp-18bp on the longest tranches at launch, and 2bp-4bp on the two shortest dated offerings, IFR calculations show.
Only Verizon's US$49bn bond from 2013, and Anheuser-Busch InBev's US$46bn bond issue from 2016 have been larger than the CVS issue.
InBev, by comparison, paid new issue concessions ranging between negative 5bp and plus 20bp on its multi-tranche offering that helped finance its acquisition of SABMiller (LON:SAB), according to IFR calculations.

The CVS deal, rated Baa1 by Moody's and BBB by S&P, is due to price later on Tuesday.

89,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 04:12PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Beige Book, Private Sector Jobs Data, and Fed Speakers To Help Dollar Rebound?
Investors are expected to carefully parse ADP nonfarm employment data, which often serves as a precursor to the monthly nonfarm payrolls data slated for Friday. Economist forecasts the private sector created 195,000 jobs in February, well below the 234,000 jobs seen in the previous month.
Speeches by both FOMC member Raphael Bostic and  FOMC Member Bill Dudley is slated for 08:00 a.m. ET and 08:20 a.m. ET, respectively, and could offer clues on sentiment among Fed members for a faster pace of rates hikes.
The Federal Reserve’s beige book, a report that includes anecdotal evidence on the health of the US economy from 12 regions will be closely watched for any subtle change in commentary on inflation following hawkish language seen in the Fed’s January meeting minutes.
The dollar fell against a major basket of currencies Tuesday amid ongoing concerns over the prospect of a trade war, and fears that economic adviser Gary Cohn could step down if Trump decides to proceed with tariffs.
2. Crude Supplies To Show Build For Second Straight Week? 
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. ET is expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles rose for the second straight week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 2.7 million barrels in the week ended March 2.
Crude oil futures settled just above breakeven on Tuesday as investors appeared to unwind their bullish bets oil prices amid fears over a build in U.S crude stockpiles.
3. Bank of Canada Expected To Leave Rates Unchanged
The Bank of Canada (BoC) is expected to leave interest rates unchanged on Wednesday at 1.25% as the economy cooled amid several domestic headwinds including tricky North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) negotiations.
Investors will parse the accompanying statement from the BoC to gauge the mood of the central bank for further tightening at policy meetings later this year.
The BoC has raised rates three times since mid-2017, with its most recent rate hike in January this year as BoC governor Poloz attempts to normalize interests rates. The pace of rate hikes, however, is expected to slow amid slack in the labor market and timid economic growth.
USD/CAD fell 0.66% to C$1.2884."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (L:RBS) has reached a $500 million settlement with New York state to resolve charges it misled investors by selling risky mortgage securities that contributed to the 2008 global financial crisis.
The settlement announced on Tuesday by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman calls for the British bank to pay $100 million in cash to the state and provide $400 million of relief to homeowners and communities, including funds to build affordable housing.
RBS is the sixth bank to settle similar claims by New York, resulting in roughly $3.7 billion of settlements.
JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) have also settled, with JPMorgan's roughly $1 billion accord in November 2013 the largest, the attorney general's office said.
RBS admitted to having in 2006 and 2007 misled investors into believing the residential mortgage-backed securities it sold were properly underwritten and complied with applicable laws and regulations.
The New York probe had focused on 44 securities offerings worth more than $52 billion, including many that plummeted in value as housing and financial markets fell into distress.
“While the financial crisis may be behind us, New Yorkers are still feeling the effects of the housing crash,"" Schneiderman said in a statement. ""Today's settlement is another important step in our comprehensive effort to help New Yorkers rebuild their lives and communities.""
RBS last month said it has set aside 3.2 billion pounds (US$4.4 billion) to cover potential settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice and other regulators over RMBS sales.
""Putting our remaining legacy issues behind us is a key part of our strategy,"" Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in a statement. ""Settling these issues is a stark reminder of the heavy price we continue to pay for the global ambitions pursued by the bank in the run up to the crisis.""

The lack of a settlement with the Justice Department has impeded the U.K. government's ability to reduce its recent 71 percent stake in RBS. It had taken a larger stake during the financial crisis, but has sold down part of it.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday fined Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) New York Stock Exchange and two affiliate exchanges a total of $14 million for multiple regulatory failures related to disruptive market events.  
The charges stemmed from five separate investigations and include the first-ever charge for violating Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity (Reg SCI), the sweeping set of business continuity and disaster recovery regulations adopted by the SEC in late 2014, the regulator said in a statement.
The NYSE's violations included erroneously implementing a market-wide regulatory halt and negligently misrepresenting stock prices as ""automated"" despite extensive system issues ahead of a total shutdown, the SEC said. 
""For retail investors to have confidence in our markets, exchanges must provide accurate information and comply with legal requirements, including being equipped for unexpected market disruptions,"" Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in the statement. 
The regulator warned the NYSE just over a year ago that it was considering an enforcement action against the exchange in connection with nearly a four-hour trading halt on July 8, 2015 that was the result of a flawed software rollout.
The SEC on Tuesday also pointed to the extreme market volatility on Aug. 24, 2015, when a record intraday drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was worsened by a quick succession of nearly 1,300 temporary trading halts in various stocks and exchange-traded funds. The halts spread confusion among investors as to what was trading and whether they received fair prices for completed trades.
""We take our regulatory obligations seriously and remain focused on building and maintaining industry-leading technology and ensuring that our markets operate with the utmost integrity,"" NYSE spokeswoman Kristen Kaus said in a statement on Tuesday. 
Previous SEC enforcement actions against exchanges include a $14 million settlement in 2015 with BATS Global Markets, which is now owned by Cboe Global Markets (O:CBOE), over charges that two exchanges acquired by BATS had given advantages to certain high-frequency trading firms.
In May 2013, the SEC penalized Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) $10 million to settle charges stemming from mistakes made during Facebook Inc's (O:FB) initial public offering in 2012.
ICE shares were up 0.5 percent at $73.19 on Tuesday.

95,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 11:45PM ET</span>","Kobe Steel, Toyota hit with U.S. lawsuit over vehicle metal quality","By Tina Bellon and Yuka Obayashi
NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. consumers have filed a lawsuit against Kobe Steel Ltd (T:5406) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) accusing the companies of violating consumer protection laws and engaging in fraud by concealing the use of substandard metal components in vehicles.
The proposed class-action lawsuit represents the first U.S. consumer complaint filed against Kobe Steel over data fraud, and highlights the legal risks the company faces even after Chief Executive Officer Hiroya Kawasaki announced on Tuesday he would quit to draw a line under the scandal.
The 112-year-old company, which supplies steel and aluminum parts to manufacturers of cars, planes and trains around the world, admitted last year to supplying products with falsified specifications to around 500 customers, throwing global supply chains into turmoil.
Kobe, Japan's third-largest steelmaker, said on Tuesday that the data fraud had gone on for nearly five decades, and that it found new cases of impropriety, widening the number of affected clients to 605, including 222 overseas. The company said Kawasaki would quit on April 1.
The U.S. lawsuit, filed on Monday in federal court in San Francisco, was brought by two California residents who seek to represent a nationwide class of consumers who bought allegedly defective Toyota vehicles.
According to the complaint, Toyota's Prius, Camry, Land Cruiser and Lexus vehicles have all been manufactured with ""sub-standard"" steel, aluminum and copper. 
The plaintiffs allege that Toyota and Kobe Steel both violated federal and state consumer protection laws by claiming that the vehicles complied with U.S. quality standards.
""We have not grasped the whole content of the case and we are now looking into the matter,"" a Kobe Steel spokesman said on Wednesday.
Toyota declined to comment on the lawsuit.
In a special order in November, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration asked 29 automakers, including Toyota, to disclose any safety issues for any of their vehicles or engines containing products supplied by Kobe Steel.
The regulator did not immediately respond to a request for comment on what data it had received in response and whether there was any evidence of faulty materials in Toyota cars.
Monday's 40-page lawsuit outlines the ways in which the companies allegedly concealed poor metal quality. It demands compensatory and punitive damages of an unspecified amount.
According to the complaint, at least six Toyota car models sold or leased to U.S. consumers were manufactured with substandard metal from Kobe Steel. Plaintiffs said the metal could impact vehicle safety and performance.
Toyota had the duty to disclose any defective vehicle components because it has consistently marketed its automobiles as safe, functional and reliable, the lawsuit says. 
Kobe and Toyota had superior knowledge and access to the facts, the lawsuit alleged, giving rise to fraud by concealment claims.
Four individuals in Canada who bought cars that use Kobe's products have already brought class-action lawsuits seeking unspecified damages against Kobe and it subsidiaries.
Kobe is also undergoing a separate U.S. Justice Department probe. 

A company executive said on Tuesday that it is fully cooperating with the U.S. probe, but it was hard to predict how it would develop.

96,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 09:20PM ET</span>",U.S. says 'Pharma Bro' Shkreli deserves at least 15 years in prison,"(Editors Note: paragraph 11 contains language that some readers might find offensive)
By Brendan Pierson and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Tuesday said former drug company executive Martin Shkreli should spend at least 15 years in prison after being convicted of fraud, saying his lack of remorse and respect for the law justified a long time behind bars.
The request by the Department of Justice came three days before Shkreli's scheduled sentencing by U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn federal court.
Prosecutors called Shkreli ""a man who stands before this court without any showing of genuine remorse, a man who has consistently chosen to put profit and the cultivation of a public image before all else, and a man who believes the ends always justify the means.""
Shkreli, 34, had requested a 12-to-18-month term following his conviction last August for lying to investors about the performance of his hedge funds MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, and conspiring to manipulate the stock price of the drug company Retrophin Inc (O:RTRX).
Known as ""Pharma Bro,"" in part for his ability to attract attention, Shkreli is perhaps best known for raising the price of the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by more than 5,000 percent in 2015, while serving as chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, now called Vyera Pharmaceuticals.
Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, declined to comment on the government's sentencing request.
Shkreli has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered social media followers $5,000 for a hair from former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
On Monday, Matsumoto ordered Shkreli to forfeit $7.36 million of ill-gotten gains. She said he may be forced to give up assets such as a Picasso painting and a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album if he cannot find the money.
In a letter to the judge last week, Shkreli said he accepted that he had made ""serious mistakes,"" but still considered himself ""a good person with much potential.""
But prosecutors said that while in jail, Shkreli has privately expressed disdain for his conviction and the judicial process, providing further evidence he does not deserve mercy.
It cited a January email conversation where Shkreli allegedly wrote ""fuck the feds"" and expressed hope for a big tax refund because only his ""liquid money"" was affected by the forfeiture.
""Shkreli's email communications confirm that any remorse he may express publicly is a carefully constructed facade,"" prosecutors said.
A 15-year term is shorter than the minimum 27 years recommended under federal guidelines. Brafman has called that length ""draconian and offensive.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Currency trading volumes on Thomson Reuters' platforms hit a record high in February and fixed-income venues have reported a surge in activity as a resurgence in volatility and new regulations push investors to trade electronically.
Thomson Reuters said on Tuesday average daily volumes of FX products in February rose to $463 billion, 37 percent higher than a year earlier, and up from January, which was also a record month.
A sudden sell-off in stock markets in late January and the ramifications of an end to record central bank stimulus have rattled investors and caused trading to accelerate across asset classes.
Volatility in FX and bond markets have risen, albeit from historically low levels.
In the bond market, a new European Union financial markets directive known as MiFID II came into force at the start of this year, encouraging more investors to shift onto electronic trading venues.
Bond investors have generally executed trades over the phone and many have resisted the move to electronic platforms until recently. 
TradeWeb, one of the world's biggest bond platforms and majority-owned by Thomson Reuters, said European-based clients had traded 73 percent more European corporate and financial bonds - products affected by the new rules - in February versus a year earlier.
Another bond platform, MarketAxess, saw volumes for the first two months of this year rise to $301 billion, up from $238 billion last year.
Kevin McPherson, global head of sales at MarketAxess, said Mifid II was ""among the drivers of the high level of electronic trading"".
Global fixed-income markets were showing ""signs of returning to more normal levels of volatility,"" he said. 

Average daily trading volumes of currencies at Thomson Reuters topped $463 billion in February, up $338 billion a year earlier. The company said average daily volumes on its platforms have totaled $407 billion on a long-term basis.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",BMW to develop and produce electric Mini in China,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Research and development of the next electric Mini will take place in China, BMW (DE:BMWG) board member Peter Schwarzenbauer said on Tuesday, as the British brand awaits a new alliance with Chinese carmaker Great Wall Motor Co. (SS:601633)
BMW announced last month that it had signed a letter of intent with Great Wall, potentially giving the Chinese company its first foreign manufacturing partner and the German group's first Mini assembly site outside Europe.
""It will be developed in China and it will be produced in China, but we don't know where yet,"" Schwarzenbauer told reporters ahead of the Geneva auto show, which opened to the media on Tuesday. ""The car could also be exported.""
So far BMW has relied on its research and development facilities in Germany to produce the current Mini. More stringent local regulations, however, are forcing a shift of intellectual property to China.
""You have to have certain components localised. In the new energy vehicles regulation, the drivetrain and the battery technology needs to be sourced locally,"" Schwarzenbauer said, adding that BMW Group would rely on its existing sales partnerships to sell the vehicle. 
BMW's own electric car, which is built and developed in Germany, is not eligible for local subsidies because it does not have components sourced in China, Schwarzenbaer said.

111,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Citigroup moving toward 'national digital bank': CFO,"(Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) is laying the foundation, through a growing network of mobile banking tools, to support the launch of a national digital consumer bank sometime within the next three years, its chief financial officer said on Tuesday.
""I am not making an announcement right now, but I would be really disappointed if it was anything close to being three years away,"" CFO John Gerspach said at an investor conference. ""We really are laying the groundwork for having a national digital bank.""
Gerspach also said first quarter markets revenue was up by a ""low-to-mid"" single digit percentage from a strong quarter a year earlier.
Citigroup operates branch offices for individuals in only six big U.S. cities, but has a national franchise in consumer credit cards. After the 2007-2009 financial crisis, it retreated from offices in smaller cities and the state of Texas to reduce costs.
Gerspach said the bank does not want to begin marketing a national digital bank to consumers until it is sure it can digitally open and service accounts over mobile phones and computers to the satisfaction of customers.
The banking industry has been pruning branch networks as people increasingly use smartphones to make deposits and payments. But industry expert say having branches still makes it easier to attract new accounts.
Citigroup, the fourth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, had fewer than 700 U.S. branches at year-end compared with more than 4,000 at the three biggest banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co, (N:JPM) Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  & Co. (N:WFC)
Gerspach's outlook for market revenue comes one week after a JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) executive said first quarter markets revenue was increasing by a ""mid-to-high"" single digit percentage from a strong quarter a year earlier.

Executives at both banks said revenue was particularly strong in foreign exchange, emerging markets and equities trading.

Last year, Airbus agreed to take a majority stake in Bombardier's CSeries jetliner program, which had not secured a new order for the 110-130 seat plane in the 18 months before the deal.
Their partnership is awaiting regulatory approval and both Bombardier and Airbus have expressed optimism over the CSeries' long-term sales prospects. 
""First we're going to have to sell the aircraft, in order to then work with suppliers on costs of the program, because at the moment there is a gap,"" Klauss Richter told reporters at Airbus' Toulouse headquarters.
""An increase in productivity rate will help,"" he said.
In November, EgyptAir signed an initial order for 12 CSeries jets and Bombardier also received an order for 31 planes from an undisclosed European buyer, marking an end to its sales drought.
Quebec's Prime Minister Philippe Couillard, also speaking to reporters at Airbus's Toulouse headquarters, said approval from the regulators was the final hurdle standing in the way of a viable future for the CSeries.
The deal gives the CSeries improved economies of scale and a better sales network. 

Bombardier said in February that there had been a ""bit of a pause"" in orders for its 110-130 seat jets as airlines wait for it to complete the Airbus partnership deal.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 12:44PM ET</span>",Far-right union wins more seats on Daimler plant's works council,"DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - A German trade union accused by rival labor representatives of harboring neo-Nazis has expanded its presence on the works council of a key plant operated by luxury carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), election results showed on Tuesday.
The Daimler works council at the Untertuerkheim plant in southern Germany last month accused neo-Nazis of using the Zentrum Automobil union as a base, with the aim of turning the factory into a showcase for their views.
In a vote to elect new representatives for the German carmaker's works council, which negotiates with management, Zentrum Automobil added two seats to bring its total to six, while the IG Metall union extended its lead to 37 seats out of a total of 47.
German media has reported that several labor representatives at Daimler's headquarters in Untertuerkheim, which employs about 19,000 staff, were affiliated with neo-Nazi groups and have voiced xenophobic views.
The reports come at a time of heightened concern about the far-right after the rise of the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has surpassed the center-left Social Democrats in a nationwide opinion poll.
Workers founded the Zentrum union in 2009, four years before the AfD was set up. Zentrum Automobil has said it opposes exporting jobs abroad and accused IG Metall of colluding with management to the detriment of workers.
Daimler has said it opposes any far-right activity among its workforce and would monitor developments closely.

The carmaker produced armaments for the Nazis before and during World War Two, making the issue of possible far-right infiltration particularly sensitive for the company.

PARIS (Reuters) - Imminent airline decisions on $10 billion of wide-body plane orders could influence the fate of Airbus' A330neo even before the recently upgraded jet completes flight trials, industry sources said.
A Tuesday announcement from Hawaiian Airlines that it had dropped its order of six Airbus A330neos in favor of 10 787-9 Dreamliner jets by rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) was a sharp blow to the suffering wide-body program.
American Airlines said in January it was reviewing the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner and shorter-range Airbus A330-900, which is in test flights before entering service this summer.
The U.S. airline aims to buy some 25-30 wide-body jets and could make a decision in coming days, one of the sources said.
""We are still evaluating our widebody options,"" a spokesman for the airline said.
Even Boeing's most vigorous supporters doubt Airbus would give up on the A330neo, which is key for its bottom line, but the contest marks the latest in a series of battles between Boeing's newest long-haul jet in the air, the 787 Dreamliner, and upcoming A330neo - a market-share feud that has consumed the two planemakers for the past nine months or more.
Level, a long-haul budget carrier recently set up by British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG), is also closing in on an order for about 8 planes in the same segment, the sources said. 
""We'll wait and see and we'll take advantage of whatever aircraft is available,"" IAG boss Willie Walsh said on Tuesday.
Airbus has had patchy results with the latest version of its money-spinning A330, relaunched in 2014 with efficient new Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) engines, and has made boosting sales one of its top priorities this year.
A330 family output has fallen to six a month from a peak of 10, making the success or failure of Airbus's only profitable wide-body line a key topic for investors. 
""The A330 makes money and generates cash, while absorbing a great deal of overhead,"" said Sash Tusa, aerospace analyst at Agency Partners, adding that its long list of customers was useful to Airbus when it came to marketing other planes.
HAWAII SWITCH
Jitters over the future of the A330neo became apparent when AirAsia, one of Airbus's largest customers, toyed with the idea of switching to Boeing's 787.
Its decision to uphold an order for 66 jets, first reported by Reuters, eased pressure on the A330neo but analysts say that could change if it feels too exposed as the dominant buyer..
The last major A330neo order was for 28 planes from IranAir but doubts are growing whether that can be implemented any time soon due to U.S. concerns about a nuclear sanctions deal.
Industry sources agree Airbus is under intense pressure to win at American, preventing further output cuts and gaining valuable bragging rights in future contests across Asia.
Keeping the A330neo in the game would also leave less space for a new mid-market plane that Boeing is thinking of launching as early as this year - a 225-275-seat model that partly competes with the A330 family.
An Airbus spokesman declined to comment on specific contests, but said, ""Many campaigns are ongoing, building on the 110 airlines who are operating the A330 family today.""
After trouncing Airbus in wide-body sales last year, Boeing aims to seize the advantage by targeting Airbus’s slow-selling A330neo with further sales of its competing 787.
Some analysts have speculated Boeing would also revive the passenger version of its 767 as a cheaper alternative to the A330, but an executive ruled this out.
But keeping A330neo output to a minimum would leave Airbus increasingly dependent on one model, the much newer A350-900, for its position in the wide-body market - mirroring Boeing's predicament in the Airbus-led narrowbody market. 

As the two marketing armies chase around the globe to the next 787-A330 dog fight, Australia's Qantas and Air New Zealand could be next to step into the battle, sources said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Plc and two former top executives said civil fraud charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over a failed African coal project are ""plainly wrong"" and should be thrown out.
In a court filing late Monday night, Rio Tinto, former Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott rejected SEC claims they should have written down Mozambique coal assets no more than 11 months after buying them in 2011 for $3.7 billion, rather than waiting 17 months.
The delay enabled the big Anglo-Australian mining group to raise about $5.5 billion from U.S. investors kept in the dark about the deterioration, the SEC argued in a lawsuit filed in October with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
The defendants said that in the months after the acquisition they had reason to believe the value of the assets had actually grown by $1.2 billion, as rising prices for ""scarce"" coking coal helped offset lower barging and rail capacity.
The market viewed the eventual $3 billion writedown as immaterial ""in the context of a company with total assets of about $120 billion,"" they also said, adding that the SEC did not claim that Rio Tinto's stock or bond prices were harmed.
""The SEC alleges that Rio Tinto should have taken the impairment within just 11 months of acquisition - at a time when Rio Tinto had not yet completed its analysis of the quantity and quality of available coal or determined whether there was a viable means for transporting that coal to market,"" the defendants said.
""The SEC is plainly wrong, and each of its claims consequently ... must be dismissed,"" they added.
U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres set a March 19 deadline for the SEC to respond.
Rio Tinto wrote off most of the assets, which it had acquired in a takeover of Riversdale Mining and later renamed Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique, in January 2013, and sold them in late 2014 for just $50 million.
The Monday filing came three days after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission brought its own civil court action against Rio Tinto, Albanese and Elliott over the coal assets.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>",Kenya Airways looks upmarket for financial salvation,"By Duncan Miriri
NAIROBI (Reuters) - When Sebastian Mikosz took over as CEO of loss-making Kenya Airways (NR:KQNA) last June, he immediately shut its outlet in Nairobi's downmarket Accra Road, which served thousands of small traders who fly to the Far East to buy cheap goods in bulk.
The move marked the beginning of an aggressive hunt for cost savings and premium passengers, after years of losses following a slump in tourism and large debts incurred to buy new aircraft.
Polish native Mikosz, who helped turn around flag carrier LOT Polish Airlines as its chief executive, needs to stem those losses before it can begin to pay down $2 billion of debt restructured in November to stave off the airline's collapse.
He told Reuters he plans to roll out a new economy plus class by the end of the year designed for business and wealthy leisure travelers, including growing numbers of American tourists and executives from dozens of Nairobi-based U.S. firms.
Coming first to wide-bodied planes, it will mean new seats with the same capacity by using space between them. ""We are working on a pretty big reshape of the onboard experience,"" Mikosz said.
The airline also plans a direct route to the Indian Ocean luxury tourism island of Mauritius and the first direct flight from Nairobi to New York by any airline from October, a plan Mikosz said was known as the ""$100 million project"" for the revenue the daily flight is expected to bring in.
The U.S. route will compete with indirect flights from established players such as Emirates [EMIRA.UL], British Airways and Ethiopian Airlines (ETHA.UL) and test Kenya Airways' ability to reshape its image from an Africa-focused carrier.
""We still have to prove that we can produce an operating profit,"" Mikosz said in an interview in his office overlooking airport service hangers. ""That is the biggest challenge that we have in an environment where you have a lot of competition.""
Twenty five foreign airlines operate out of Nairobi's main airport, including Turkish Airlines which is expanding in Africa and state-owned Emirates, South African Airways and Ethiopian.
Mikosz describes this state-backed competition as his biggest fear as he tries to turn around a publicly listed firm owned 48.9 percent by the government and 7.8 percent by Air France/KLM (PA:AIRF) and attract a strategic investor.
""It is really sometimes very frustrating when you see that somebody can have much lower costs thanks to this protected environment and you have to face a real free market economy,"" he said.
HEADWINDS
His plans mark a shift from a focus on African air passenger demand, which the International Air Transport Association (IATA) sees growing by almost 6 percent a year over the next decade due to increasing economic output and poor road and rail links.
Kenya hosts regional hubs for 48 U.S. or U.S.-based businesses like Google (O:GOOGL) and  IBM  (N:IBM) and the United States is the fastest-growing source of tourists, many changing planes in Europe or the Gulf in more than 20-hour trips.
Jan Mohamed, chief executive of TPS Eastern Africa (NR:TPSE), which runs the Serena chain of luxury hotels and safari lodges, said people would pay extra for direct flights, which take about 15 hours.
Tickets to New York have begun retailing for around $1,000 return, compared with about $1,500 for an indirect flight.
A former executive at Kenya Airways, who helped return it to profitability after years of losses in the early 1990s, said the new strategy was sensible, but held some risks.
""The money is in the business part of the operation. The leisure side will give you volume but it gives you volume at low rates,"" he said, cautioning that the airline must be careful not to undermine Sky Team Alliance partners like Delta (N:DAL) and Air France KLM, which feed it passengers from America.
Mikosz said there was plenty of room. The potential to Europe is ""very big,"" he said, adding that he planned to add a second daily flight to Amsterdam in high season alongside KLM.
Forty-year-old Kenya Airlines, which flies to 53 destinations with 38 Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Embraer planes, has not said when it will return to profit. 
It lost 80 engineers to higher paying Mideast rivals before the restructuring and Mikosz, who says the U.S. route will create 150 new jobs, fired 140 technical staff after a strike in November.
Politics provides other headwinds.
Kenya only got U.S. security clearance a year ago after a major refurbishment of Nairobi's main airport and the United States extended a warning last week over the threat to aviation from militant activity in eastern Kenya, which borders Somalia.
The company, which reports full-year results in June, had a $251 million loss in the financial year 2016-17 and negative equity of 45 billion shillings.
The government restructured its debt in November, converting loans to build up its stake from just under a third to preserve a national carrier that serves the vital tourism sector and growing foreign investment.
Shareholders found their holdings diluted 95 percent by the restructuring but shares more than tripled to 18.50 shillings ($0.1829) before dropping back by around four shillings.
The government has guaranteed some of the airline's debts and Mikosz and his team have 10 years to clear them.
""Sell more tickets and cut costs,"" said the CEO, who has headed up major Central European online travel agent eSky.pl as well as helping to rescue LOT from bankruptcy.
""It's always the same game.""

146,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>",BOJ Watchers Push Back Exit Forecasts as Kuroda Talks Timing,"(Bloomberg) -- Fewer economists see any chance of monetary tightening this year by the Bank of Japan after Haruhiko Kuroda’s renomination as governor and his comments on when the BOJ is likely to start thinking about exit. None forecast any change at this week’s policy meeting.
While the vast majority of 49 economists surveyed by Bloomberg think the central bank is inching closer toward the day it will start winding back its monetary stimulus program, less than one-third of them think it will come this year. That’s down from about half in Bloomberg’s last poll in January.
While the reappointment of Kuroda was widely expected, many observers were surprised by the clarity of his comments to parliament on March 2 about exit timing. Kuroda said that sometime around the fiscal year starting in April 2019 the BOJ would probably be considering the details of any wind down of stimulus. His comments came before the Feb. 27-March 5 survey closed.
During further questioning by lawmakers on Tuesday, Kuroda said he didn’t mean to indicate that the BOJ would immediately make a change in fiscal 2019, but had intended to convey that the policy board may be discussing how to move forward with exit at that point.
Even so, the comments reinforce the view that the end of the easy money era which spanned the global economy for the last decade is ending, even if Japan still has a way to go.
The Federal Reserve, Bank of Canada and Bank of England have already raised interest rates and may do so again soon, while the European Central Bank is debating how soon to end its own bond-buying. China’s central bank is sticking to what it describes as neutral policy settings and is ratcheting up money market rates to cool the pace of borrowing. Bloomberg Economics estimates net asset purchases by the main central banks will dwindle to around zero around the start of 2019."

148,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Steel tycoon ousts gas mogul from top of Russia rich list: Forbes,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vladimir Lisin, controlling shareholder of Russian steel producer NLMK (MM:NLMK), displaced natural gas magnate Leonid Mikhelson at the top of Russia's rich list for 2018, Forbes magazine, which compiles the list, said on Tuesday.
Another steel tycoon, Alexei Mordashov, who controls NLMK's leading competitor Severstal (MM:CHMF), retained his grip on second place. Like Lisin, his fortunes were buoyed by rising global steel prices.
Of the 2,208 billionaires included by Forbes in its global rankings this year, 102 are Russian, of whom one is a woman.
Lisin, 61, is in first place and 57th worldwide, having seen his net worth increase by $3 billion to an estimated $19.1 billion as of this year, the magazine said.
Mordashov, 52, in close second with an estimated personal fortune of $18.7 billion, has enjoyed an increase of $1.2 billion since last year's Forbes list, placing him 60th globally.
Mikhelson, head of natural gas company Novatek (MM:NVTK), was pushed into third place in the Forbes list of Russian billionaires.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department published a list of 96 ""oligarchs"" deemed close to the Kremlin that bore a close resemblance to the Forbes rankings for 2017.
The list was published as required by a package of sanctions legislation that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last year.
Those included on the U.S. list were not immediately subject to sanctions, but the publication cast a shadow of uncertainty over them and President Vladimir Putin labeled the list an ""unfriendly act"".

149,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 10:40AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley breaks down which markets provide the clearest hints of a downturn,"The agreed definition of a bear market is a 20% decline from the most recent high. 
But it's not as straightforward to predict when a bear market is looming. Moreover, the bear markets in the 1980s crash, the dotcom bubble, and the 2008 financial crisis were all preceded by strong final rallies.
Strategists at Morgan Stanley have put together a guide on which assets are most consistent with the final stages of a bull market.
""Our current environment of rising inflation, strong data, tighter policy, flatter yield curves and more volatility is consistent with a late-cycle market,"" said the team of strategists including Serena Tang in a note on Sunday. 
""But late-cycle doesn't necessarily mean every drawdown must be 'the big one' — looking at S&P, the market for which we have the longest history, since 1950, bull corrections (10%+ declines with quick recoveries) have happened almost twice as frequently as bear markets for the S&P, with the two having very different recovery trajectories and incentivizing very different strategies.""
The strategists examined the trailing six-month and 12-month performances of major assets, and compared them to returns in the same timeframes during the run-up to previous bull market peaks.
In the stock market, every region seems consistent with a late-cycle market except emerging markets and Europe, which have lagged their usual performance in the 12 months going into a market top. And on a sector basis, telecom, tech, and energy stocks aren't as strong as they typically are at the late stages of a bull market. 
The outcomes are less mixed for the corporate-credit market. ""Interestingly, most of credit looks out of line with a late bull market environment, having outperformed materially over the last 12 months versus what's usually seen in the run-up to equity tops,"" Tang said. Notably, she added, US high-yield credit rated BB, and European debt rated BBB are the best outperformers, meaning they're also more vulnerable in a late bull market. 
Like corporate debt, US Treasurys have outperformed relative to the late-bull-market environments Morgan Stanley studied. 
The dollar's slide since late-2016 lines up with late-cycle behavior. But according to Tang, the 12% decline over the past year, which was partly driven by stronger economic growth in other countries, ""is an extreme move."" The euro, pound, Malaysian ringgit and peso have all gained more than usual in a late-cycle, Tang said. 
""Most other currencies are consistent with a late-bull market backdrop."""
150,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 10:39AM ET</span>",JPMORGAN: The stock market's most trusted strategy is on its last legs,"For most of the almost nine-year stock bull market, investors have viewed weak stretches as opportunities to increase exposure.
And can you blame them? The equity market has made a habit of snapping back quickly following sell-offs, which has emboldened traders to buy more on declines, thus perpetuating the cycle.
Well, enjoy this ""buy the dip"" strategy while you can, because it's showing signs of fading, JPMorgan says.
The firm is specifically perturbed by the ""erratic"" behavior of retail investors last week, when the benchmark S&P 500 dropped 2%. Rather than seeing a steady stream of inflows amid the selling, the direction of the money trail was inconsistent at best, according to JPMorgan.
This trend ""casts doubt on the idea that retail investors will serve as the marginal buyer of equities in the current conjuncture,"" Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, a global market strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a client note. ""The potential withdrawal of retail investors as the marginal buyer of equities could create clear downside risk for equity markets for the near term.""
Of particular concern to JPMorgan is the $100 billion that poured into equity exchange-traded funds in January. With traders already so heavily invested in stocks heading into what was a turbulent February, the firm fears traders may not have enough dry powder to sustain a buy-the-dip strategy.
JPMorgan is also perturbed by what it sees as a lack of investor liquidity, which it says stems from a defensive stance being adopted by market makers. The firm argues that their hesitance to put money to work worsens liquidity, which in turn makes volume thinner, thus exacerbating any price moves that do take place.
But what about buybacks, which were just highlighted by one of Panigirtzoglou's JPMorgan colleagues as potentially underpinning further stock strength?
Let it be clear that Panigirtzoglou isn't arguing repurchases will be futile — he simply thinks they ""might take some time to materialize,"" depriving the market of a backstop that has proved crucial throughout the bull market.
With all of this in mind, it's important to note stocks could continue exhibiting strength, even without the same buy-the-dip mentality as before. But such buying will have to be catalyzed by fundamental drivers rather than by a sentiment-driven knee-jerk reaction.
Assuming Panigirtzoglou is correct, how will the market handle resting on its laurels? That's a question investors will have to answer for themselves as the bull market trudges on."

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Lego's sales fell last year for the first time since 2004 as the Danish toymaker struggled with tough retail markets in Europe and North America, highlighting the challenges facing the new chief executive.
The privately-owned company, famous for its colorful plastic bricks, could be facing its biggest test since flirting with bankruptcy in the early 2000s after a sudden halt to more than a decade of strong growth.
Sales fell 8 percent to 35 billion Danish crowns ($5.8 billion) in 2017, compared with a 6 percent increase in 2016 and a far cry from the 25 percent growth achieved in 2015. 
The company said overall consumer sales were flat, but the figures were affected by a clean-up of inventories that were set high at the beginning of the year in anticipation of growth.
Lego saw ""strong double-digit"" growth in China, while most established markets in North America and Europe declined. The company will open an office in Dubai this year to help boost sales in the Middle East and Africa.
Lego said in September it would lay off 8 percent of staff and that it had pressed the ""reset-button"", acknowledging its business had grown too complicated.
""We're now aligning ourselves, building the foundation and starting to make investments that will bring us back to growth again. Probably not the type of supernatural growth we had before, but growing in line with the industry,"" Chief Executive Niels B. Christiansen told Reuters.
The company's Lego Ninjago series benefited from the release of the movie in September. Lego said it was working with Warner Brothers to create the next Lego movie, to be screened in 2019. 
Toy makers including Mattel (O:MAT) and Hasbro (O:HAS) have been hit by the bankruptcy of the biggest U.S. toy-store chain Toys'R'Us in September.
But Christiansen said consumer sales grew in seven of Lego's 12 largest markets in December and that the company started 2018 in a better position.
Christiansen joined Lego in October after nine years as CEO of Danish industrial group Danfoss, taking over from Briton Bali Padda who was in the post for just eight months.
Attempting to fully embrace the digital era, Christiansen said he would invest heavily in products that combine the physical brick with the digital world.
""In the field between the digital and physical, I think Lego has a unique opportunity,"" he said.
Last year, the company launched Lego Boost which allows children to bring creations to life via simple coding.
Founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, his grandson Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen is now the main family representative at Lego and ranked last year by Forbes as the 35th wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of $21.1 billion.

PARIS (Reuters) - French aeronautics supplier  Safran  is contingency planning for a cliff-edge Brexit that disrupts cross-border supply chains and could lead to divergence in British and European Union regulations, a senior company director said on Tuesday.
Marie de Saint-Cheron, Safran's (PA:SAF) director for European Affairs, said she considered the proposed transition too short a period to negotiate new treaties and added that a hard Brexit, whereby World Trade Organisation rules apply, could not be ruled out.
""It's a scenario we are preparing ... hoping that what we get is not as severe,"" Saint-Cheron told a panel discussion, sat beside a British official from the Department for Exiting the EU.
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday said Britain will not join a customs union with the EU after Brexit, worrying businesses such as Safran, whose British activities include the production of landing and transmission systems for jets.
May also said Britain would explore how it could remain a member of a handful of specialist institutions like the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Safran's LEAP engine, made in a joint venture with GE Aviation (N:GE), powers all Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX aircraft.
Saint-Cheron described regulatory divergence as the ""key risk"", despite May's attempts to reassure concerns felt in the aviation industry.
""What we worry about is that after the transition period ... regulatory divergence begins. And in that case it will be very difficult for us to work together,"" she said.
Saint-Cheron said Safran did not envisage for now moving any of its subsidiaries out of Britain. In the event of a hard Brexit, she added, Safran would likely start by repatriating operations that do not require heavy investments, such as its maintenance operations.
Aviation industry players are pressing May for more certainty over the way borders will work.
Under a 1980 agreement among 32 members of the WTO, civil aerospace parts are not subject to duties. But the aerospace industry is concerned that extra paperwork caused by new customs borders may introduce expensive delays.
Chris Hobley, director for market access at Britain's Department for Exiting the EU, said London wanted a ""strong, deep and ambitious"" relationship with the EU.
He also reiterated May's pledge of a ""strong commitment"" to regulatory standards that remain as high as those of the EU.
Airbus (PA:AIR), which manufactures its wings in Britain, said last week it might have to stockpile parts to cope with potential disruption when Britain leaves the EU. 
Saint-Cheron said customs data shows Safran makes some 70,000 France-to-Britain cross-border operations annually. 
""We're thinking about putting people in place, and an IT system, to manage customs clearing,"" Saint Cheron told Reuters after the event. 

""One or two additional days (at the border) will be costly so we're trying to put in place a system which would be smooth enough to avoid such delays in the supply chain.""

153,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 12:13PM ET</span>","BlackRock, Soros may invest in Deutsche's asset management IPO: source","By Tom Sims, Hans Seidenstuecker and Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BlackRock (N:BLK), George Soros and big sovereign wealth funds are among investors expressing interest in buying stakes in the initial public offering of Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) asset management arm, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The sovereign funds include Singapore's Temasek (TEM.UL) and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), the person said.
 Deutsche Bank  is finalizing plans for the IPO of the asset management business, known as DWS, that have been a year in the making. Deutsche is expected to sell 25 percent of existing DWS shares for 1.5-2 billion euros ($1.9-$2.5 billion), people close to the matter have said. 
DWS is seeking anchor investors, the person said, while it also wants to ensure the liquidity for the free floating shares.
Deutsche Bank's largest investors, the Qatari royal family and the Chinese conglomerate HNA [HNAIRC.UL], are not expected to invest in the IPO, said the person, who disclosed the potential investor base on condition of anonymity because the IPO process is ongoing. 
Spokesmen for Qatar and HNA declined to comment. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment, while the potential DWS investors declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.
The DWS listing will mark the most tangible milestone yet in Chief Executive Officer John Cryan's struggle to restructure the flagship German bank.
Deutsche said in March 2017 it would list a stake in DWS as part of a broader overhaul to help the bank move on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals. 
Some investors have raised questions about the timing of the IPO as the economic growth cycle turns and financial markets become more volatile.
""One of the key investor concerns regarding DWS is the question whether the asset management industry in general is at the top of the cycle,"" said a second person close to the IPO.
The asset management industry is facing pressure on fees and rising regulatory costs, which show no signs of abating and which could limit profits for the sector. 
""Asset management is under pressure from regulators, investors and the public to perform better and charge less,"" said Tom Brown, Global Head of Asset Management at consultants KPMG. ""Firms need scale or to specialize to stay in the game."" 
These potential constraints come on top of issues specific to Deutsche Bank.
""Will DWS be able to cut costs as harshly as needed?"" the second person close to the IPO said. ""Will it be able to do an interesting large M&A deal given the fact that DB wants to retain control?""
Another concern among investors is that Deutsche Bank could dilute the price of DWS shares by selling down its stake if the bank needs to raise capital. 
The IPO would help Deutsche to bolster its balance sheet and quell shareholder unrest over the pace of its turnaround after three consecutive years of losses. It could also possibly open the way to dividend payouts.
A price range for the shares is expected to be announced as soon as Sunday, followed by the publication of an investor prospectus on Monday.
The IPO would likely take place in the week of March 19, sources have said, adding it had been brought forward hoping to lock in stock market valuations ahead of any correction.

DWS head Nicolas Moreau, formerly with the French insurer  Axa  (PA:AXAF), has been on the road for four weeks over the past few months drumming up investor interest and plans to meet with investors again next week.

(Reuters) - A U.S. government national security panel has identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd's (O:AVGO) $117 billion bid for chipmaker  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), a senior U.S. Treasury official said in a letter to the companies on Monday.
Shares of Qualcomm slid 3 percent on growing investor concern that such government scrutiny, unusual for a deal that has not yet been agreed, would scupper any takeover by Broadcom. 
Some of the U.S. government's concerns relate to risks associated with Broadcom's relationships with foreign entities, Aimen Mir, the Treasury's deputy assistant secretary for investment security, said in the letter, without identifying who those parties might be.
The letter, dated March 5, was made public by Qualcomm on Tuesday. The U.S. government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ordered a national security review of Broadcom's proposed deal on Sunday in an unusual move that prompted Qualcomm to delay a March 6 shareholder meeting. The letter said that, as with every investigation, the review will consider the potential risk of an unnamed ""actor"" working through Broadcom to hurt U.S. national security, adding that the bulk of CFIUS' concerns were classified. CFIUS, made up of representatives from the Departments of Defense, State, Justice, Treasury, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security, assesses proposed foreign deals to purchase U.S. assets to ensure they do not harm national security. The inter-agency body, led by the Treasury, rarely looks at mergers before companies have clinched an agreement, highlighting the urgency of U.S. concerns about safeguarding semiconductor technology. The review of the Broadcom deal illustrates the U.S. government's expanding focus on the competitiveness of the national semiconductor industry as China advances, regulatory experts said.  The U.S. government is concerned that Chinese companies, including the big network equipment and mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], will take advantage of any openings to take the lead in the next generation mobile phone networks known as 5G. ""A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative security consequences for the United States,"" Mir's letter said. Broadcom said in a statement it was cooperating with CFIUS. ""There can be no question that an American Broadcom-Qualcomm combination will provide far more resources for investments and development to that end."" Broadcom said last year it plans to move its headquarters to the United States from Singapore.  A source familiar with CFIUS' thinking told Reuters on Monday that if Broadcom acquired Qualcomm, the U.S. military had concerns that within 10 years ""there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that's essentially Huawei."" Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia, putting the company in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U.S. concerns. 
Its has a dominant position in China, which is set to become the world's biggest 5G market by far, but has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) in several lucrative markets, including countries that are longstanding U.S. allies.

""We would like to have consensus with our Chinese partner,"" Zetsche said, referring to BAIC, the Chinese company with which Daimler operates the Beijing Benz factory in Beijing.
""We will examine everything if it is in keeping with the wishes of our partner,"" Zetsche said, adding that Li had underlined his positive view of Daimler's management and areas of potential cooperation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Macquarie (AX:MQG) is trying to pull out of the Russian-focused infrastructure fund it manages after some of the investments underperformed, three industry sources and a banker said.
The fund, the first major private fund dedicated to infrastructure in Russia and the CIS when it was set up in 2008, owns debt in Brunswick Rail and equity stakes in energy suppliers  Enel  Russia (MM:ENRU), GSR Energy, and telecom company Russian Towers.
A spokeswoman for Macquarie declined to comment. No data is available on the fund's performance.
""Last fall Macquarie decided to get rid of the fund either through asset sales or selling their general partner role and MIRA’s (Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets) asset stakes in the fund completely and withdraw from it,"" Vladimir Lelekov, chairman of Brunswick Rail, said in an interview.
The fund had a target size of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, one of its investors the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), said on its website, but only raised $630 million. Macquarie has been the sole manager since its partner Renaissance Capital pulled out in 2013.
Apart from the EBRD, the other investors include development banks the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB), Russia's development bank Vnesheconombank.
Development banks typically have a mandate to kick off investment in difficult sectors and jurisdictions in the hope private money will follow. But Macquarie and Renaissance were the only private investors.
While the world's biggest country by landmass has a pressing need for investment in infrastructure, industry sources said it was hard to make good returns. This was because of an unpredictable political and legal environment and the collapse in the ruble's value since 2014.
Lelekov also said that managing the fund had become harder for Macquarie since it closed its Moscow office in 2017. The Macquarie spokeswoman confirmed it had no office in the Russian capital.
""They have been running the fund out of London for some time now and it's not the best way to handle investments in Russia if you want to achieve results,"" Lelekov said.
An EDB spokeswoman confirmed that Macquarie was seeking to sell its portion of the fund. She said by email the EDB had been consulted but could not name any potential buyers.
A banking source, who declined to be named, said he knew of parties interested in the fund. The source declined to name them. A third industry source said the fund had underperformed and was for sale.
The EBRD and the IFC committed $100 million each to MRIF. Spokesmen for both declined to comment on Macquarie's plans. In an email, an official at Vnesheconombank, which had committed $200 million, declined to comment on any sale or whether it had been consulted.
BUDGET SQUEEZE
Infrastructure in Russia has suffered from years of under-funding. The slump in oil prices and Western sanctions imposed over Russia's involvement in Ukraine hit the rouble and this squeezed government spending.
But the oil-dependent economy was on the mend in 2017 after two years of recession and with the prospect of more cash, infrastructure moved up the list of government priorities ahead of a presidential election this month.
The sources did not provide a detailed performance of the fund.
Enel Russia (MM:ENRU) has rallied from 2014 lows but is still far below its peak when oil prices were surging in 2008
It is also lower than its price in 2012, when MRIF bought a blocking stake along with Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF, investment firms AGC Equity Partners and Xenon Capital Partners and others.
An official at Russia's majority owner Enel (MI:ENEI) declined to answer any questions about MRIF.
Financial details for Russian Towers and GSR were not available.
According to statements on its website, Brunswick Rail returned to profit in 2016 after sharp losses in 2014-2015, driven in part by currency swings. In the quarter ending March 2017, the company posted a revenue of $33.1 million and an operating profit of $13.3 million.

The Commission concluded that Chinese producers had significant spare capacity and that this was likely to lead to large-scale imports into the European Union at dumped prices if the measures were lifted.
The duties on seamless stainless steel pipes and tubes were first set in 2011, with a review begun after their expiry in 2016. The duties remained in place during the review.
The measures are among 17 put in place by the European Union against different grades of steel and steel products from China.
EU producers include  Sandvik  (ST:SAND), Tubacex (MC:TUBA) and  Salzgitter  (DE:SZGG).

Chinese producers affected include Changshu Walsin Speciality Steel Co, Shanghai Jinchang Stainless Steel Tube Manufacturing Co and Wenzhou Jiangnan Steel Pipe Manufacturing Co.

191,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 10:45AM ET</span>",India's PNB bank fraud likely to swell beyond $2 billion mark,"By Abhirup Roy and Devidutta Tripathy
MUMBAI (Reuters) - The extent of the unraveling fraud at India's state-run  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) could rise beyond the nearly $2 billion mark so far outlined by the lender, according to a source involved in the probe and court documents reviewed by Reuters.
The source, who asked not to be named, said investigators had not yet recovered all the papers and loan guarantees allegedly issued by rogue employees of the bank, and consequently believed the bank's exposure could be greater than revealed so far.
In what has been dubbed the biggest fraud in India's banking history, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and police have accused two jewelry groups - one controlled by diamond tycoon Nirav Modi and the other by his uncle Mehul Choksi - of colluding with bank employees to get credit from overseas banks using fraudulent guarantees.
Both Choksi and Modi have denied the allegations and lawyers for the two key accused PNB employees in the case have also said they are innocent.
According to court filings, the exposure to three companies controlled by Modi has been estimated at 64.98 billion rupees ($1 billion), while firms controlled by Choksi have been accused of defrauding the bank of 61.38 billion rupees.
India's federal police, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has told a Mumbai court that the amount involving Modi's companies was likely to go up, according to the source and court filings, copies of which have been reviewed by Reuters.
The CBI told the court that its investigation had found that the fraudulent issuance of letters of undertaking (LoUs), or guarantees, through a Mumbai branch of the bank had been going on since 2010. 
In papers filed on Monday, the CBI also said PNB did not have all the documents related to the LoUs, since those were returned to the borrower.
""Most of these documents are not yet recovered. The size of the fraud has now gone (up)...and the same is likely to go even higher,"" the CBI said in the court filing.
PNB did not respond to requests on Tuesday seeking comment on the risk of its exposure rising further.
The bank initially reported to authorities on Jan. 29 that the jewelry groups had defrauded it of 2.8 billion rupees, or about $44 million. On Feb. 14 it said the fraud sum had reached $1.77 billion after a detailed investigation.
It raised the amount further to nearly $2 billion last week, saying it had discovered some $200 million more in fraudulent letters of credit, another form of credit guarantee, issued to Choksi's Gitanjali (NS:GTGM) group.
Investigators widened their probe on Tuesday with the government's Serious Fraud Investigation Office beginning to call senior executives from Gitanjali's creditor banks for questioning over their loan exposure, separate sources with direct knowledge of the probe said.
Police also arrested on Tuesday Vipul Chitalia, a vice president at Gitanjali, taking the total number of people arrested so far in the case to 19. Chitalia, who police say was the authorized signatory for Gitanjali for the allegedly fraudulent transactions, was detained by Indian immigration authorities on his arrival from Bangkok.
Jeweler Modi along with his family left India in January before PNB filed a police complaint, according to police, who also say Choksi is out of India. Their whereabouts are not known.
PNB shares fell 2.3 percent on Tuesday in a Mumbai market (NSEI) that slipped 1.1 percent. The stock has lost almost 40 percent of its market value since disclosing the fraud on Feb. 14.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told parliament on Tuesday that PNB had ""sound fundamentals and strong growth potential"" with its high share of low-cost current and savings accounts deposits, stabilizing bad loans and scope to raise funds by selling non-core assets.
 Axis Bank  (NS:AXBK), a private sector lender, said in a stock exchange filing the Serious Fraud Investigation Office had sought information from it on the accounts of Nirav Modi and Gitanjali groups of companies, adding its exposure to both groups was about 2 billion rupees.

192,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 04:43PM ET</span>",Wall Street gains even as trade war worries dominate,"By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eked out a small gain on Tuesday after a choppy session as investors worried about the prospects of a trade war due to mixed signals from Washington on whether U.S. President Donald Trump would follow through with proposed tariffs.
Trump reiterated his plan to slap hefty import tariffs on steel and aluminum saying ""trade wars aren't so bad"" even as lawmakers such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stepped up calls to scrap the proposal.
Earlier in the day strategists said some investors were beginning to bet Trump would not follow through on the proposal, which they saw as a negotiating tactic in trade talks. But gains were limited by the uncertainty throughout the day. 
""The market doesn't want to hear the uncertainty, the market wants to hear one way or another,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
""If our worst fears are confirmed ... the market should have even greater losses than what we saw last week. Likewise if it seems we're not going to have a trade war the market should go higher."" 
Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Investment Management in New York, said there are ""no winners in a trade war.""
""The market is basically grasping for straws around what the (tariff) policy is going to be. Based on the action we saw today it's hoping it doesn't turn into a trade war,"" he said.
Investors were also eyeing news that North Korea was open to the possibility of talks with the United States on denuclearization.
""North Korea helps around the margin,"" said Mackay.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.36 points, or 0.04 percent, to close at 24,884.12, the S&P 500 gained 7.18 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,728.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.30 points, or 0.56 percent, to 7,372.01.
Most of the S&P's 11 sectors rose, with the materials index leading the gainers with a 1.1 percent increase as investors in that sector bet against a trade war, according to Independent Advisor Alliance's Zaccarelli. 
Utilities was the biggest faller, with a 1.4 percent drop.
Among the bigger movers of the day, Target fell 4.5 percent after the big-box retailer reported lower-than-expected profit for the holiday quarter.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) dropped 2.9 percent after a U.S. government national security panel said it identified potential risks that warrant a full investigation of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd's $117-billion bid for the chipmaker.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 132 new highs and 17 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.87 billion shares, compared to the 8.07 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","U.S. clothing, cosmetics on possible EU retaliation list","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Clothing, orange juice, cosmetics and other products from the United States may be subject to European Union duties if U.S. President Donald Trump carries out his threat to impose global import duties on steel and aluminum.
The European Commission has said it would respond ""firmly"" to proposed U.S. import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum. It has drawn up a list of 2.8 billion euros ($3.46 billion) worth of U.S. products on which it could apply a 25 percent tariff.
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday those products included Harley Davidson (N:HOG) motorcycles, bourbon and Levi jeans.
The Commission briefed representatives from the EU's 28 countries on Monday, showing them the list, which is split fairly equally in value between steel products, consumer products and food and drink.
EU diplomats said on Tuesday that the second category, worth just over 1 billion euros, included shirts, jeans, textiles, footwear, cosmetics, motorcycles and recreational boats.
The food and drink category, worth just under 1 billion euros, included bourbon whiskey, corn and orange juice.
The products can generally be sourced elsewhere. Some come from states important to the U.S. Republican Party. Harley Davidson, for example, is based in Wisconsin, the home state of House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan. Bourbon comes mostly from Kentucky, home to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
The list of counter-measures remains subject to the U.S. administration's actually imposing tariffs on EU steel and aluminum. Trump said the plan would be formally announced this week.
Depending on the details of that plan, the European Commission is expected to hold a short public consultation before presenting to EU member states the proposed counter-measures.
Under World Trade Organization rules, counter-measures would have to be brought in within three months of a U.S. decision on tariffs.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - IAG (L:ICAG) could consider buying more A380s from Airbus (PA:AIR) if the superjumbo was cheaper, CEO Willie Walsh said, adding that he was also looking at planes for the airline group's new carrier Level.
IAG operates the British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus airlines, as well as Level, a low cost unit launched last year which flies between Europe and the United States.
IAG already operates 12 A380s, and could be interested in buying more if Airbus improved the pricing, Walsh said, although the airline was not currently negotiating with Airbus. 
""The pricing that Airbus has offered in the past is unacceptable to us,"" Walsh said on the sidelines of a conference hosted by industry body Airlines for Europe. 
""We've said very clearly to Airbus if they want to sell A380s they need to be aggressive on pricing and when they work out how to sell the aircraft, knock on our door and we'll talk to them."" 
Airbus secured the future of the superjumbo when it agreed a deal with airline Emirates in January for up to 36 A380s worth as much as $16 billion at list prices.
For Barcelona-based Level, Walsh said he would need to buy planes to meet a plan to grow the fleet to 30 aircraft by 2022, and would consider a number of different aircraft. 
""I think in five years' time, I think there might be opportunities for a different aircraft type,"" he said, suggesting that Level would not just stick to the A330s it currently operates.
""There are Airbus options with the A330-neo or the A350 and as I said more and more we'll see Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787s becoming available at that stage,"" Walsh said, noting that 787s may become an option in the coming years, if their price comes down or second-hand planes become available. 
Those decisions may fall to Level's new chief executive. Walsh said IAG was in the final stages of interviews to appoint a CEO for Level.
Among Walsh's other concerns is the building of a new runway at Heathrow Airport in London, where IAG's biggest airline British Airways is based.
IAG would be interested in running terminals at Heathrow, Walsh said. 
The company already runs a terminal at JFK airport in New York and Walsh cited the example of Munich's terminal 2, run as a joint venture between airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and the airport, as a ""good example"" of how this can be done. 
""Would I like to run Terminal 5? Absolutely,"" Walsh said when asked about his interest in running parts of Heathrow. 
Walsh has long-complained about the cost of a proposed new runway at Heathrow, and a lack of competition at the airport, and has recently called for Britain to allow other operators to build facilities and run terminals at Heathrow. 

""We know how to do it (run terminals) and we know the benefit that that can bring so we're open to doing it,"" he said.

195,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 02:37PM ET</span>",Target sees margins stabilizing in year ahead as profit disappoints,"By Nandita Bose and Uday Sampath Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Target  Corp (N:TGT) said on Tuesday it expects profit margins to stabilize in the year ahead even as they are pressured by investments in store and online operations, sending its shares down more 4 percent in afternoon trading.
To spur growth, Target is revamping its supply chain, strengthening online delivery services, investing in its own brands and employees, and connecting its online and store shopping experiences for customers, Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said at an investor meeting at Target's headquarters in Minneapolis.
Earlier in the day, the retailer reported fourth-quarter profit that missed estimates, gross margins that were at their lowest in 20 years, and gave a disappointing forecast for first-quarter comparable sales. Shares were down 4 percent at $72.10 after earlier sinking more than 5 percent.
""2017 was all about putting down a plan, getting the wheels turning in the right direction,"" Cornell said. ""2018 is about acceleration, leveraging our greatest assets and leaning in to our competitive strength."" 
The retailer plans $3 billion of capital expenditure this year to support those investments, remodel stores and strengthen online operations to stay competitive. In February last year, Target said it would reinvest more than $7 billion through 2020.
The company said it would introduce free two-day shipping without a membership requirement, following larger rival Walmart Inc (N:WMT), which introduced the feature last year on orders of $35 or more. Target did not say if the free shipping was conditional upon a minimum order of a certain value.
Target said more than half its online order volume was shipped or picked up from stores, a key factor driving online sales growth of 29 percent during the fourth quarter. That made it a fourth straight annual jump in online sales of more than 25 percent in the year through Feb. 3.
MISSING EXPECTATIONS
Earlier in the day, Target missed fourth-quarter earnings expectations for a third consecutive year.
Looking forward, the company expects only modest comparable sales growth in the low single digits for the first quarter, with analysts expecting 2.36 percent. It expects adjusted earnings of $1.25 to $1.45 per share, against analyst estimates for $1.40 per share.
For the full year, Target reiterated its forecast from January, expecting adjusted earnings of $5.15 to $5.45 a share, compared to analyst estimates for $5.27 per share.
The earnings miss bucked strong fourth-quarter results from rival brick-and-mortar retailers like Macy's Inc (N:M), Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) and  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY), who have suffered the most from the market-share gains made by Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) over the past decade.
Profit margins were further eroded by a hike in employee wages in the fourth quarter. In October, the company said it would raise wages for hourly workers to $15 by 2020 and as part of that plan, will raise them to $12 per hour this spring.
In a bid to fend off rivals, Target has focused on doubling the number of its small-format stores, aggressive product promotions and keeping grocery prices low. On Tuesday, it said it will remodel 1,000 stores by 2020. Excluding items, Target earned $1.37 per share in the fourth quarter ended Feb.3, just shy of average analyst estimates for $1.38.
Gross margins stood at 26.2 percent, lower than 26.6 percent a year earlier.
Quarterly comparable sales grew 3.6 percent, beating expectations and was its strongest performance since the first quarter of 2012, thanks to higher customer traffic at both stores and online. Analysts expected a 3.1 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 

Sales grew 10 percent to $22.77 billion, topping the average estimate of $22.53 billion, helped by an additional week in the fourth quarter.

Markets have been on edge since last week when U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the United States would impose 25% import tariffs on steel and 10% tariffs on aluminum.
The proposal has been widely criticized, with the U.S. facing backlash from world leaders. Leading Republicans have also pressured Trump to reconsider the plan. While uncertainty lingers, some investors feel the tariffs are all talk, as Trump tweeted that he would be willing to be flexible on trade with Canada and Mexico if they agreed to a “fair” North American Free Trade Agreement.
Trump is expected to finalize the tariffs later in the week.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The accelerating demise of diesel, long used by carmakers to boost fuel-efficiency, is undermining their plans to meet looming European Union CO2 goals and avoid big annual fines.
Executives gathered on Tuesday at the Geneva auto show are grappling with unpalatable choices: re-engineer existing vehicles at huge expense, restrict sales of some profitable models; or risk hundreds of millions of euros in penalties.
Others are clinging to the hope that the image of the latest Euro 6 diesels may yet be rehabilitated, and their fortunes restored.
""I am worried,"" Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said in a Reuters Television interview.
""But it's our job to solve these problems,"" he said. ""I'm firmly convinced that diesel will experience a revival.""
But a fresh flurry of bad headlines and the growing prospect of outright diesel vehicle bans are already sending their sales into a steeper tailspin.
While diesels produce more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates than gasoline engines, their efficiency has been instrumental in cutting greenhouse gases. As consumers shun diesels, more carmakers are on track to miss tougher EU carbon dioxide goals taking effect in 2020-21.
SALES RESTRICTIONS
Some industry insiders predict carmakers will be forced to rein in sales of larger models by raising prices to avoid overshooting the EU's 95 grammes/kilometer CO2 target.
Ford (N:F) is reviewing its European line-up in light of diesel's slide and is likely to ""restrict the sale of some vehicles that push us over the limit"", a company source said.
Steven Armstrong, the carmaker's head of European operations, played down that prospect.
""We're not having to rethink the model line-up,"" he said. ""Of course we'll have to fine-tune the volume by powertrain by vehicle, but it's not going to be a fundamental shift for us.""
VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann told Reuters his business would have to consider price increases for larger models and/or restricting sales. 
""We are required to be compliant (with EU targets) - which steps are necessary will become clear in 1-1.5 years. A significantly lower mix of diesels is not helpful,"" he said. 
Initially sparked by VW's 2015 emissions test-cheating scandal and subsequent studies exposing the true levels of NOx emissions, the diesel slump has since deepened rather than stabilizing, as Mueller and others had hoped it would.
Sales of diesel cars fell 8 percent in Europe last year, reducing their market share to 44 percent from a 55 percent peak in 2011. Partly as a result, average CO2 emissions increased in Europe in 2017 for the first time in a decade, according to researchers JATO Dynamics.
That was before the latest PR setbacks, in which VW admitted using monkeys and humans to test exhaust gas, and a court ruled that German cities were free to ban older diesel cars - joining Paris, London and a host of other urban centers that have vowed to run them off the road.
Diesel sales were down another 19 percent in Germany last month, and a whopping 24 percent in Britain, amid concern that the decline in second-hand values would give way to collapse.
'TOO LATE'
French carmakers, which have relied heavily on diesels to meet CO2 goals, are now scrambling for alternatives.  Renault  (PA:RENA) has stepped up development of a low-cost hybrid known as ""Locobox"", but the powertrain won't even begin rolling out until 2021.
PSA Group (PA:PEUP) Chief Executive Carlos Tavares insisted last week the  Peugeot  maker remained on track. In a newspaper interview the same day, however, he urged governments to suspend penalties for non-compliance until electric car charging networks are better developed.
Tavares said on Tuesday he would seek backing for his demands from Europe’s ACEA car industry lobby group, which he currently chairs.
Fuel-saving 48-volt hybrids being rushed out across the Peugeot, Citroen and newly acquired Opel line-ups are not expected to arrive before 2022 under current plans.
""It's not just at PSA that it's happening too late – it's happening too late everywhere,"" said Philippe Houchois, a London-based automotive analyst with investment bank Jefferies.
""The cost of CO2 compliance is one of the potential triggers of the next auto recession,"" Houchois said. ""Manufacturers are going to have to raise prices on larger petrol cars to meet their emissions targets, and that's going to hit sales overall.""
Already last October, investment research house MSCI was warning that ""all carmakers apart from Toyota (T:7203) are at risk of missing regulatory targets for fleet emissions in 2021"".
The Japanese carmaker is dropping diesels from its European fleet as it benefits from two decades of dominance in petrol-electric hybrids.  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) is expected to announce a diesel phase-out in its mid-term plan, due in June.
German premium automakers are also better resourced to absorb the shock, by ramping up sales of plug-in hybrids already in their portfolios or pipelines while rushing out 48-volt technology to curb emissions across existing model lineups - including the two-year-old Mercedes (DE:DAIGn) E-Class.
But the strategy of leaning on costly plug-ins for CO2 compliance has limits, as well as profitability perils.
BMW (DE:BMWG) admits it is already taking a hit on the hybrid version of its X5 SUV, priced 600 euros below the diesel version at 72,500 euros ($89,500), despite its higher cost.
""The profitability of plug-in hybrids is below that of cars with pure combustion engines,"" a company spokesman said.
That spells bigger trouble for volume brands, which lack the lucrative luxury models to offset ""compliance cars"" sold at lower profit or even a loss to meet CO2 goals.
""If everybody wants to sell a lot of electrified vehicles, the prices are going to collapse,"" said one PSA Group engineer.
""And since it's a market that's already quite unprofitable, people are just going to lose their shirts.""

203,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",U.S. energy storage market to nearly triple this year: report,"By Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - U.S. deployments of energy storage systems will nearly triple this year thanks to sharply lower costs and state policies that support the case for installing batteries in homes, businesses and along the power grid.
That forecasted growth of 186 percent to 1,233 megawatt-hours of storage from 431 MWh compares with the 27 percent increase in 2017, according to a report by GTM Research and the Energy Storage Association trade group published on Tuesday.
That's in part because some large projects that had been expected for 2017 were pushed into the early months of 2018, but also because the market for batteries in homes and businesses is finally taking off, according to GTM analyst Ravi Manghani, who said that part of the market logged growth of 79 percent last year.
The growth in the use of batteries for electricity storage has been a boon to manufacturers such as Tesla Inc (O:TSLA),  LG Corp  (KS:003550) and others.
Storage system costs have fallen by roughly two thirds in the last five years, Manghani said. In addition, more states are mandating utilities procure storage systems.
The market for energy storage is still small, generating just $300 million in value last year, the report said. But batteries have long held the promise of solving the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, so their development is closely watched by investors, regulators and power companies. The market is expected to exceed $1 billion in 2019, the report said.
Pairing big batteries with renewable energy projects improves reliability without creating climate-changing emissions, and more homeowners and businesses are looking to batteries for backup power and to capture the excess energy from rooftop systems to use when the sun is not shining.
Large systems for utilities are still the biggest segment of the market, and more utilities are including storage in their solicitations for solar projects, Manghani said, adding that a year from now he would expect most solar project solicitations to include a storage component.

""There is a big sort of shift in mindset,"" he said.

China may allow its offshore-listed tech giants to sell a form of shares on the mainland, or China depositary receipts (CDRs), people with knowledge of the plan have said, in a move that would pit Shanghai and Shenzhen against Hong Kong in the battle to host the country's tech giants.
Expectation of the move has already stirred investor interest, with money gushing into shares listed on the tech-heavy start-up board ChiNext Composite Index (CHINEXTP).
E Fund ChiNext ETF (SZ:159915), China's biggest exchange-traded fund that tracks the start-up board, has seen its assets under management (AUM) jump 70 percent this year to 8.79 billion yuan ($1.39 billion).
Its smaller rival, Hua An SZSE ChiNext 50 ETF Fund , saw its size jump nearly six-fold to 1.65 billion yuan.
Other major ChiNext ETFs, including GF ChiNext ETF and China Southern ChiNext Index , also saw heavy inflows this year.
ChiNext shares have jumped more than 12 percent over the past month, compared with a fall of over 2 percent in the blue-chip CSI300 Index (CSI300).
That is a reversal of fortune from last year, when the ChiNext tumbled 11 percent but the CSI300 surged 22 percent.

In what could be the start of a pushback against the agreed carbon emissions targets by the main ACEA European carmakers' lobby, Tavares - who currently chairs the ACEA - said he would propose the new demands to its board this week.
""I think it's only logical that there should be commitments from governments,"" Tavares told reporters at the Geneva auto show.
The potential suspension of penalties if charging network rollouts fall short of targets is ""to be discussed"", he added.
In a newspaper interview last week, Tavares suggested carmakers should not be fined for non-compliance if the density of electric-car charging networks remained inadequate.

The accelerating decline of diesel, long used by carmakers to boost fuel-efficiency, is undermining carmakers' efforts to meet the looming CO2 goals and avoid big penalties.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 04:10AM ET</span>","Foreigners trim Asian stock holdings in Feb, biggest outflow since 2015","By Patturaja Murugaboopathy 
(Reuters) - Foreigners turned net sellers of Asian equities in February, with outflows over the month hitting their highest in more than two years, amid an increase in market volatility as well as a rise in U.S. Treasury yields. 
February data from seven Asian exchanges showed foreign outflows totaled about $9 billion, the most since August 2015. That also compares to an inflow of $7 billion in January.
GRAPHIC: http://reut.rs/2FeTxKX
Some analysts say Asia is likely to see a further exodus of foreign funds given continued high valuations and worries over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans. 
Taiwan stocks led the region with outflows of over $3 billion in February, while South Korea and Thailand witnessed outflows of $2.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. 
""February saw the revival of volatility with increased concerns over higher borrowing costs pressuring global equity markets,"" said Jingyi Pan, a Singapore-based market strategist at trading and investments provider IG. 
GRAPHIC: http://reut.rs/2FfYTd3
The CBOE Volatility index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility of the S&P 500 index (SPX), jumped to a 2-1/2 year high in early February.
""Asian markets had not been spared, with jitters cutting across to the region, inviting outflows from the considerably riskier Asian assets,"" Pan added.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell about 5 percent in February, its biggest decline in over two years.
The exit of foreign funds from Asia was partly driven by attractive U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) that touched a 4-year high of 2.941 percent in February amid concerns U.S. inflation would pick up. 
Despite the recent correction, equities in India, China, Indonesia, Philippines were trading above their 10-year average price-to-earnings ratios at the end of last month, indicating more foreign selling could be on the cards, analysts said. 
Asian equities are also likely to come under further pressure from Trump's tariff plans for imported steel and aluminum. South Korea is the No.3 steel supplier to the United States after Canada and Brazil and would be the hardest hit by the tariffs. Other Asian suppliers are Japan, Taiwan and India. 

""The U.S. tariff plan certainly kicked up the risk-off sentiment by a notch and the seemingly unfavorable developments could keep markets wary in the months ahead, capping inflows,"" said IG's Pan.

The creditors have asked the administrator to find a firm to finance the planned litigation, the person also said. Air Berlin and the administrator declined to comment. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad was not immediately available for comment.
The administrator had said he was assessing possible claims against Etihad that could potentially reach more than 1 billion euros, arguing that Etihad did not meet its financial obligations toward Air Berlin, once Germany's No.2 carrier.
Etihad owned a 29 percent stake in Air Berlin and had been providing funding since becoming a shareholder in early 2012. In April 2017, Etihad sent a letter of support to Air Berlin, saying it would provide funding for the next 18 months.
But in August, Etihad said it would no longer provide funding, saying Air Berlin's business had deteriorated at an unprecedented pace.
The German government stepped in with a 150 million euro ($185.96 million) bridge loan to keep Air Berlin's planes flying and prevent thousands of travelers from being stranded while it sought a buyer. That loan takes precedence over other creditors.
Air Berlin's assets have since been divided up between Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), easyJet (L:EZJ) and former motor racing champion Niki Lauda. 
However, the government loan seems unlikely to be repaid in full, leaving other creditors out of pocket too.

216,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 11:31PM ET</span>",Australia Holds Key Rate as Divergence Weighs on Currency,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank left interest rates unchanged as its increasing policy divergence from global peers weighs on the currency, potentially aiding economic growth and inflation.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe and his board kept the cash rate at a record-low 1.5 percent Tuesday, in line with market and economists’ expectations. They’re trying to prolong a hiring boom and soak up spare capacity in the labor market in order to generate faster wages growth. The RBA chief signaled he’s seeing some progress.
“The rate of wage growth appears to have troughed,” Lowe said in a statement announcing the decision. “Inflation is likely to remain low for some time, reflecting low growth in labor costs and strong competition in retailing. A gradual pick-up in inflation is, however, expected as the economy strengthens.”
The local dollar was little changed after the statement’s release, buying 77.82 U.S. cents at 3:05 p.m. in Sydney.
The RBA is standing pat as developed world peers move to normalize policy or raise interest rates in response to tighter job markets and accelerating growth, as they overcome fallout from the 2008 global recession. While Australia dodged the slump due to massive resource demand from an industrializing China, its economy is sluggish now due to record-high household debt and weak wage growth that’s slowed consumption and inflation.
“Wage growth remains key, as this will ultimately drive inflation, and it remains anemic; real wages have stagnated over the last year,” said Sarah Hunter, head of macroeconomics for Australia at BIS Oxford Economics. “We don’t see the cash rate rising until 2019, likely the second half of the year.”
Australian bonds are now yielding less than their U.S. counterparts for the first time since around the turn of the century, which is starting to weigh on the currency. The Aussie has fallen about 1.6 percent in the past month, though continued support from stronger commodity prices is likely to prevent a sharp drop. In February 2001, it traded below 48 U.S. cents, but that reflected weak terms of trade as well as rate differentials.
Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac Banking Corp., predicts the U.S. federal funds rate will climb to 112 basis points above the RBA’s cash rate in 2019. He sees the Federal Reserve raising to 2.625 percent next year and Lowe and his board remaining on hold until 2020.
“Market volatility has increased from the very low levels of last year,” Lowe said. “As conditions have improved in the global economy, a number of central banks have withdrawn some monetary stimulus.” He noted the Australian dollar “remains within the range that it has been in over the past two years.”
GDP Growth
The RBA altered its language around gross domestic product in the statement, removing its more precise forecast of growth “a bit above 3 percent over the next couple of years” in favor of: “the bank’s central forecast is for the Australian economy to grow faster in 2018 than it did in 2017.”
Australia’s GDP for the final quarter of last year is due for release tomorrow. It probably slowed after a slump in exports over the period, with coal shipments hampered by poor weather and related issues. At the same time, the RBA’s easy policy has encouraged business investment and spurred a hiring bonanza as 400,000 new jobs were added in 2017, a record three-quarters of which were full-time.
Still, the jobless rate at 5.5 percent is about half a percentage point off what the central bank estimates is full employment, while inflation is still hovering just below the bottom of its 2 percent to 3 percent target. The RBA wants to be nearer those goals before it’s ready to begin tightening, Lowe has indicated.
The central bank also noted Tuesday that house-price growth in Sydney and Melbourne has slowed. It said regulatory measures have helped contain “the build-up of risk in household balance sheets, although the level of household debt remains high.”
(Updates with comments from economists, Lowe from sixth paragraph.)

217,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 09:00PM ET</span>","Trump Tariffs Are Black Day for World, Business, BHP CEO Says","(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump’s plans to slap tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is a black day for the world and business, according to the biggest mining company.
BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd. and competitors could be hit should other economies follow the move by the U.S. toward a more protectionist and anti free-trade agenda, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said Tuesday at a business summit in Sydney. The U.S. tariffs are “a black day for the world and business,” he said.
“I am worried about this sentiment shift that people all around the world might suddenly say that free trade isn’t good for the world and that would be particularly bad for a trading company like BHP,” Mackenzie said during a panel on the economy. ""We have to speak up loudly against these measures as being bad for America and bad for the world.""
BHP joins the chorus of global criticism from business and government that’s greeted Trump’s plans to impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum. His surprise announcement Thursday roiled global financial markets amid mounting concern of an international trade war.
“Free trade is self-evidently the lifeblood of the global economy, and we expect it to flourish despite the regrettable developments in the U.S.,” Mackenzie said. Outside the U.S., “we observe buoyant economic conditions underpinned by the growth of free trade,” he said.
The move came after an inquiry sparked by U.S. metal producer complaints that they were hobbled by lower-cost output from China and other countries. Mackenzie said he would like to see the U.S. and China work more closely together despite ongoing conflict.
""I certainly see the tensions,"" said Mackenzie. ""I hope over time they can find a way of working together.""

Fears over the possibility of a global trade war appeared to have eased somewhat after House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan put pressure on President Donald Trump to rethink his tariffs plan.
""We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,"" Ryan’s spokeswoman AshLee Strong said in a statement on Monday. ""The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don't want to jeopardize those gains,"" said Strong. House Republications were reportedly drafting a letter to Trump about trade concerns, but Trump has openly responded by saying he would not back down.
U.S. equities pushed higher following the development, with the Dow closed 1.4% higher and the S&P 500 rose 1.1%.
China’s National People’s Congress remained in focus on Tuesday. China reiterated its prudent monetary policies would remain neutral, noting that it targeted a 6.5% growth this year and would cut its target for budget deficit to 2.6% of its GDP from the previously stated 3%.
The Shanghai Composite opened 0.3% higher by 8:35pm ET, while the Shenzhen Component also gained 0.2%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.7%.
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei jumped 2.1% after four days of losses. Bank of Japan’s deputy governor nominee Masayoshi Amamiya’s comments received some attention as he said the central bank has the tools to eventually exit its monetary easing programme. His comments came after governor Kuroda said the BOJ would probably start considering the details of any exit in the next fiscal year.
Down under, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 1.2% as investors await RBA’s policy decision later in the day. The central bank is expected to keep its rates unchanged. Australia's 4Q current account deficit widened to $14.02 billion in the December quarter, from the September quarter’s $11.01billion. Retail sales number grew 0.1% M/M in January, missed the general consensus of a 0.4% growth.

LONDON (Reuters) - World share markets regained ground on Tuesday as news that the United States and North Korea will meet for talks next month came on top of hopes that President Donald Trump's political allies would convince him to avoid a global trade war. 
The broadest gauge of global stocks, MSCI's All Country World Index, was up more than 0.6 percent for a second day and Wall Street looked set for its third rise running as the rebound gathered momentum. [.N][.EU] (T)
It gained pace as North Korea said it was willing to talk to Washington about denuclearization and would suspend its long-running nuclear tests while those talks were under way.
""It looks like 'risk on' sentiment is coming back,"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy, also pointing to weaker safe-havens like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc.
Europe's mood was also supported after Germany reformed its coalition government to end more than five months in political limbo and as the initial unease caused by a hefty election vote for anti-establishment parties in Italy ebbed.
Italian bonds outperformed and shares in Milan bounced almost 1.5 percent having slipped to a six-month low after its weekend vote. 
Europe's big three - Britain's FTSE, Germany's Dax and France's Cac - were up 0.5 - 1 percent too, while the euro and pound both climbed as the dollar lost its footing again. [/FRX]
""Over and above the noise about (U.S.) protectionism we are getting now, we would need to see real evidence it is damaging growth and that is going to take some time,"" said head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, Michael Metcalfe.
""We have been here before in 2002 and 2003 with steel tariffs and that wasn't devastating.""
Top U.S. Republicans, including House speaker Paul Ryan, urged Trump on Monday not to go ahead with tariffs on foreign imports of steel and aluminum.
Even though the president said he would not back down, he suggested Canada and Mexico could be exempted if a new NAFTA trade deal was agreed. There was speculation that this had been the main motivation behind the plan.
After Wall Street's S&P 500 had put on more than 1 percent, Asia's bourses rallied in concert overnight. 
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.5 percent, snapping five straight days of losses. Japan's Nikkei jumped 1.8 percent from a five-month low, helped too by reassurances from the head of the Bank of Japan that it would not suddenly end stimulus. (T) 
Korean shares also erased the remainder of the hit they took after Trump's tariff warnings last week. The country is seen as being among the most exposed in Asia due to the large amount of steel it exports to the United States.
""Even in the face of such bad news, it shows the volume of money in the equity market that is looking for an entry point,"" said JP Morgan Asset Management's chief markets strategist for the UK and Europe, Karen Ward.
RATE EXPECTATIONS
The threat of a trade war is not the only source of tension for the world's financial markets. 
As the global economy steams ahead, investors have become increasingly concerned that U.S. inflation, which has been subdued since the 2008 financial crisis, could finally pick up and lead to fast interest rate hikes.
The European Central Bank meets this week and looks almost certain later this year to end its three-year-old, 2.5 trillion euro ($3.08 trillion) stimulus program. 
U.S. 10-year bond yields reared back up to 2.89 percent ahead of U.S. trading and euro zone yields followed suit with German Bunds off a five-week low at 0.69 percent.
""The ECB is going to be presenting growth forecasts that are likely to be stronger, but will be at pains to stress that the move away from monetary easing will be delicately done,"" said Peter Chatwell, head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho.
The euro traded back above $1.2410, having extended its recovery from a seven-week low of $1.2154.
In Italy, where currency traders are keeping an eye on post-election developments as none of the three main factions has emerged with enough seats to govern alone, the country's President, Sergio Mattarella, is expected to open formal coalition talks in April.
Early elections are possible if no coalition accord is found.
The dollar's swoon helped the Canadian dollar off an eight month low C$1.2995 it had hit on Monday as the latest round of NAFTA renegotiations fanned the trade nerves. 
Canada is most exposed U.S. tariff threats but its central bank holds a rate meeting on Wednesday and if it keeps the door open to further hikes, the currency ""is likely to be able to resist further notable depreciation,"" Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) said.
In commodities, crude prices held firm, underpinned by robust demand forecasts and prospects for informal contacts sought by OPEC with U.S. shale oil producers at an industry meeting in Houston this week.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $63.03 per barrel, up 0.7 percent following a 2.2 percent gain on Monday. Bellwether industrial metal copper gained 1.5 percent in easily its biggest jump in almost a month. 
China's government said on Monday it was confident about keeping its growth rate at around 6.5 percent this year and on Tuesday defended a move to hike military spending by the biggest amount in three years.

Boeing said it was the third petition in less than three years filed by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), seeking to unionize workers at the plant that is located in a strongly anti-union state.
The IAM petition also comes a few months after the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) made it tougher for workers to form unions made up of small groups of employees, reversing an Obama-era decision that had been sharply criticized by businesses.
""The company will challenge this filing because we strongly believe that the IAM's attempt to isolate our flight line teammates is unreasonable and is prohibited by federal law,"" said Joan Robinson-Berry, vice president and general manager of Boeing South Carolina.
No election for union representation will be scheduled until the NLRB resolves the legal challenge, the Chicago-based company said.
About 180 Boeing flightline technicians and inspectors are seeking union representation, the IAM said.
""These employees approached the IAM with serious concerns over arbitrary management decisions over overtime, bonuses and work rules,"" an IAM spokesman said via email.

Last year, almost three-quarters of the 2,828 workers at the South Carolina plant who voted rejected union representation in a win for Boeing, which had launched an aggressive campaign against the IAM.

1. Fed Speakers, Factory Orders On Tap 
With just under three weeks until the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision – widely expected to show Fed members agreed to hike rates by 0.25% - investors are likely to closely monitor speeches from a trio of Federal Reserve speakers due Tuesday.
FOMC Member Bill Dudley, who is slated for 07:30 a.m. ET, recently stoked investor expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes, when he said last week that four rate hikes this year would fit into the Fed’s plans to raise rates gradually.
FOMC Member Brainard, meanwhile is slated for 5:30 p.m. ET, while FOMC Member Kaplan speaks at 8:30 p.m. ET.
Kaplan recently warned: “If the Federal Reserve waits too long to remove accommodation at this stage in the economic cycle, excesses and imbalances begin to build, and the Fed ultimately has to play catch-up.""
Aside from speeches from the trio of Fed officials, the U.S. releases factory orders data for January expected to show a decline of 0.4% from 1.7% in December.
The dollar rose against its rivals on Monday amid easing investor fears over a trade war after Trump appeared open to lifting tariffs on aluminium and steel if the North American Free Trade (NAFTA) is renegotiated to terms more favourable to the U.S.
2. U.S. crude oil stockpiles to show unexpected decline?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles rose by 0.933 million barrels for the week ended Feb 23. That differed from the Energy Information Administration’s crude supplies total - released a day later - which fell by about 1.6 million barrels last week.
Crude oil futures started the week on the front foot, settling more than 2% higher Monday amid a report showing crude stockpiles at the cushing storage hub in Oklahoma fell suggesting that solid domestic economic growth continued to underpin crude demand.
3. Canadian PMI To Change Gloomy Economic Outlook?
The release of Canadian PMI data called Ivey PMI due Tuesday will be closely watched for any sign of green shoots of economic growth.
The Ivey PMI, which is based on surveys with key managers in leading sectors of the economy and is considered a strong leading indicator for the economy, is expected to show a reading of 56.3 for February, above the read of 55.2 seen in the previous month.
The loonie has struggled to gain upward momentum against the dollar amid concerns over North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations.
USD/CAD rallied to near eight-month highs of C$1.2938 Monday, after US President Donald Trump tweeted that ""NAFTA has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed."""

LONDON/FRANKFURT/MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) is looking to spin off auto-parts business Magneti Marelli to its shareholders via a Milan listing that will not raise money by selling new shares, four sources familiar with the matter said.
Under the deal, which is aimed at giving Magneti Marelli more flexibility - including to raise money in future - FCA investors will get shares in the parts maker in proportion to their existing FCA holding, the sources said. 
Advisers initially looked at a possible initial public offering for the 99-year old parts business to raise cash to cut FCA's debt, but the Agnelli family - FCA's main shareholder - were put off by low industry valuations and did not want their stake in Magneti Marelli to be diluted, three of the sources said. 
""At this stage it's not worth going down the IPO route,"" said one of them. ""Other than trimming FCA's debt, a listing will not bring any immediate benefit to FCA investors.""
The move could be announced by FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne, who carved out and listed luxury sports car maker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) in 2015, when he unveils his new strategy plan on June 1, the sources said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) have been appointed to spin off Magneti Marelli alongside law firms Sullivan & Cromwell in the United States and Legance in Italy, the sources said.
The business, which sits within FCA's components unit alongside robotics specialist Comau and castings firm Teksid, could be worth between 3.6 and 5 billion euros ($4.4-6.2 billion), analysts say.
But it would likely trade at a discount to peers including Germany's Hella (DE:HLE) and French parts makers  Faurecia  (PA:EPED) and  Valeo  (PA:VLOF), they add.
The Agnellis own 29 percent of FCA through their holding vehicle Exor (MI:EXOR).
FCA, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Legance declined to comment, while Sullivan & Cromwell was not immediately available for comment.
FCA said on Feb. 28 its board would review a possible spin-off of Magneti Marelli in the second quarter, after Marchionne said he wanted to ""purify"" FCA's portfolio.
The sources said the Italian-American carmaker had so far held back from sounding out possible bidders for the unit as it didn't want any distractions to the planned demerger this year.
But the spin-off may face some hurdles, as some investment funds that hold FCA stock may not want to hold onto Magneti Marelli shares, one of the sources said. 
This source said some funds may be restricted by investment guidelines allowing them to invest only in global players such as FCA, and not in a medium-sized Italian supplier.
After the spin-off, FCA will focus on finding a new owner for Comau, but it wants to keep full control of Teksid, the sources said.
Magneti Marelli, which employs around 43,000 people and operates in 19 countries, is a diversified components supplier specialised in lighting, powertrain and electronics.
It had revenue of around 8.7 billion euros in 2017, according to analysts, and adjusted core earnings of around 840 million euros.
Magneti Marelli has often been touted as a takeover target and FCA has fielded interest from various rivals and private equity firms over the years.
South Korea's Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) made a bid approach in 2016 but negotiations fell through as it was only interested in parts of the components maker, sources have said.
FCA has yet to appoint advisers on Comau, which has 15 manufacturing plants and 35 operational centers around the world and has already drawn interest from Chinese and Asian buyers, one of the sources said. The source pointed to the sale of German robotics maker Kuka to China's Midea in 2016.
Reuters reported that Shanghai Electric, Sinomach and Shanghai Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (Simee) were among Chinese firms eyeing bids for Comau in 2016.

(Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Monday ordered a New Mexico businessman to disgorge $5 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, nine months after the U.S. Supreme Court curbed the regulator's power to claw back ill-gotten gains.
The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver rejected Charles Kokesh's claim that the SEC deserved to recoup nothing because it waited until after a five-year statute of limitations ran out to sue him.
Kokesh was accused of looting investor money from companies he controlled to pay salaries, bonuses, rent and other expenses, and enabling him to fund a lavish lifestyle, court papers show.
By a 3-0 vote, the appeals court rejected Kokesh's argument that because each type of misappropriation had begun by 2001, the SEC missed the five-year deadline by waiting until October 2009 to sue.
The appeals court agreed with the SEC that the clock restarted each time Kokesh converted funds improperly.
""To hold that defendant's misappropriations constituted only one continuing violation would do much more than provide repose for ancient misdeeds; it would confer immunity for ongoing repeated misconduct,"" Circuit Judge Harris Hartz wrote.
""Defendant could take $100 a year for five years and then misappropriate tens of thousands without fear of liability,"" the judge added. ""We cannot countenance such a result.""
Last June 5, the Supreme Court unanimously concluded that disgorgement was a form of penalty, subject to a five-year statute of limitations under federal law.
That decision overturned a lower court judge's ruling, which the appeals court had upheld, requiring Kokesh to disgorge $34.9 million covering conduct dating back to 1995.
Clinton Marrs, a lawyer for Kokesh, said in an email following Monday's decision: ""While we respect the circuit court's decision, we think they got it wrong again. Mr. Kokesh is evaluating his options.""
A spokeswoman for the SEC declined to comment.
The case is SEC v Kokesh, 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-2087.

254,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 02:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Airbus sets services goal, targets productivity gains","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus has set a goal of tripling services revenues from its commercial aircraft business to $10 billion within seven years and sharply reducing the number of times its jets are stranded on the ground for technical reasons, industry sources said. 
It also targets measures worth 450 million euros ($555 million) in 2018 to improve productivity and has told staff reducing recurring costs on its newest jets - the A320neo and A350 - remains a battle, they said, citing internal postings.
The latest sign of competitive pressures comes as Airbus (PA:AIR) prepares to announce possible job cuts due to slower production of its largest aircraft - the A380 superjumbo and theA400M military air lifter - at a staff meeting on Wednesday. 
Airbus said earlier it would address implications of the slowdown at a works council meeting, but described reports of3,600 jobs cuts or redeployments as ""excessive"". 
Like rival Boeing (N:BA), Airbus is driving down manufacturing costs while branching into more profitable services, in a bid to emulate the wider margins of third parties who traditionally control the market for repairs and services. 
However it has so far given little detailed guidance on targets by business activity. 
An Airbus spokesman, in response to a Reuters query, confirmed the $10 billion service revenue target for the main jets division. 
He said the company has for some years had a rolling productivity target, but declined to give details. ""Like any leading company ... year-on-year we strive for continuous improvements, unleashing further efficiencies in every business area, strengthening our competitiveness and focusing on our customers,"" the spokesman said. 
DIGITAL SERVICES 
Chief Executive Tom Enders told analysts last month the total services business across Airbus's jetliner, helicopter, defense and space activities was worth 9-10 billion euros. 
He said Airbus mainly aims to improve that through internal growth, striking a different tone from Boeing which has been more explicit about eyeing acquisitions on its way to a goal of more than tripling services revenues to $50 billion by 2027. 
""...certainly, we don't exclude other measures but the focus is not on M&A. The focus is on organic growth of the services business,"" Enders told analysts. 
Airbus Commercial made up 76 percent of revenue in 2017. 
Enders has put emphasis on new digitally based services such as its new Skywise predictive maintenance system, following deals with AirAsia, Asiana Airlines and Etihad Airways. 
But while setting its sights on the after market, Airbus has been wrestling with delays and sporadic reliability problems, which it blames partly on engine maker Pratt & Whitney (N:UTX). 
A number of planes have been forced out of service temporarily to switch engines, but the internal targets suggest Airbus is also concerned about quality problems that fall more directly under its control, two industry sources said. 
Airbus aims to reduce the number of ""aircraft on ground"" incidents by at least 30 percent over the next two years. 
It also aims to cut by 20 percent the amount of time it takes to come up with a fix for a problem when it is identified after a plane has entered service. 
Inside its factories, it aims to reduce the amount of costly outstanding or out-of-sequence work and ensure that 85 percent of quality checks known as ""green quality gates"" are successful. 

The cost-and-quality drive comes as Airbus accelerates record output to meet demand - a trend that can quickly create headaches if productivity lags behind. Airbus aims to boost deliveries by 11 percent to 800 aircraft in 2018, including 30that it could not hand over last year due to engine problems. Reaching that goal and ensuring over 80 percent of jets are delivered on time is essential, Airbus staff have been told.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) is creating a new commodities finance team that will move staff from the securities division into the investment banking division, according to an internal memo on Monday.
Colleen Foster, global head of commodities sales, will lead the new team, called ""commodity finance solutions,"" the memo said. Her group will work closely with existing teams inside Goldman's investment bank that sell derivatives and structured finance products, with the goal of drumming up more business from corporations.
Goldman, the fifth largest U.S. bank, has been trying to turn around its commodities unit after posting one of its worst years on record. Top executives, including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, have told investors they are looking to increase trading revenue by leveraging the relationships investment bankers already have with corporate clients.
""We've underutilized the power of our leading investment banking franchise to serve as a risk manager and liquidity provider to more companies,"" Blankfein told investors in a presentation last month. [nL2N1Q30H6]

A joint venture between Goldman's investment banking and trading units has generated 16 new commodity-related transactions since the fall, Blankfein said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Automaker BMW is working with a London-based start-up to use transaction-recording technology blockchain to prove batteries for its electric vehicles will contain only clean cobalt, the start-up's CEO said.
The competition is intensifying to use blockchain, the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, to try to eliminate battery minerals produced by child labor. 
Cobalt is in focus because around two thirds of the world's supplies are from Democratic Republic of Congo, where roughly one fifth of cobalt is mined in unregulated artisanal mines.
One organization has begun a project to work with the artisanal miners to use blockchain to prove they are not using child labor.
The start-up Circulor is meanwhile working on a pilot for BMW to map cobalt that is already assumed to be clean because it comes from jurisdictions such as Australia and Canada or from industrial production in Congo, Circulor said.
   A BMW spokesman said the firm could not comment at this stage. 
""We believe it makes economic sense to start with sources that aren't a problem,"" Circulor CEO Douglas Johnson-Poensgen told Reuters in an interview.
""Once the system is proven and operating at scale, one can tackle the harder use cases like artisanal mines.""
The pilot shows it is possible to give clean cobalt a barcode and enter the main stages of its journey on to an immutable ledger using blockchain technology, Johnson-Poensgen said.
Because that is an efficient way to prove cobalt is clean, he said it had the potential to cut regulatory compliance costs, although the economics still needed to be proved.
Johnson-Poensgen was an army engineer, involved in activities such as bomb disposal in Sierra Leone and Bosnia, and has also worked for big corporations, including BT and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank. 
He founded Circulor last year with a view to tackling the need for automakers to reduce costs to make electric vehicle manufacturing is profitable.

 Glencore  (LON:GLEN) dominates industrial production in Congo. It has said it would never use child labor, while declining to comment on blockchain.

257,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 01:30PM ET</span>",Fed Study Finds Inverted Yield Curve Still Good Recession Alert,"(Bloomberg) -- An inverted yield curve remains a powerful signal of a looming recession and that is still the case even if the current ultra-low level of U.S. interest rates are taken into account, according to fresh research by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
A negative curve, where the return to investors on shorter-dated securities is above that on longer-term bonds, has predicted all nine U.S. recessions since 1955, with a lag of six to 24 months. Some have argued that this time is different, because interest rates are so low and a flattening yield curve doesn’t necessarily mean the U.S. economic expansion is heading for trouble.
The findings, published Monday in the San Francisco Fed’s regular Economic Letter, show that the term spread, or the difference between short- and long-term interest rates, is as good today as it’s always been at spotting problems ahead. But there’s no urgency just yet. While relatively flat, the current yield curve doesn’t signal a high risk of a downturn even though the U.S. economic expansion is already the third longest on record.
“Forecasting future economic developments is a tricky business, but the term spread has a strikingly accurate record for forecasting recessions,” study authors Michael Bauer and Thomas Mertens, who are both economists at the San Francisco Fed, wrote in their analysis. “While the current environment appears unique compared with recent economic history, statistical evidence suggests that the signal in the term spread is not diminished.”
The spread between one-year and 10-year Treasury yields is roughly 0.8 percent. This is slightly higher than the 0.64 percent it touched in early January, but is well under its 15-year average of around 1.75 percent.
“As of February 2018, the estimated recession probability is 11 percent, which is elevated but comfortably below the critical threshold given that the term spread is not yet close to zero,” they wrote.
Economists arguing that the world has changed point to several factors to back up their thinking, including that a decline in the so-called neutral rate of interest -- a theoretical level that neither speeds up nor slows down economic activity -- means that a rise in short-term borrowing costs will slow the economy less than in the past.
The study’s authors looked into this by incorporating several other variables, including the neutral rate asset prices, into their computer models and found that these don’t improve on the recession-spotting abilities of a simple model that only uses the term spread.
“While these hypotheses have some intuitive appeal, our analysis shows that they are not substantiated by a statistical analysis that incorporates the suggested factors into the type of predictive models we use,” they wrote. “An extensive analysis of various models leads us to conclude that the term spread is by far the most reliable predictor of recessions.”"

259,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>","Europe's IPO hopefuls face investor caution over quality, price","By Simon Jessop and Dasha Afanasieva
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe is on course for its busiest start to the year for initial public offerings since 2015 but a jump in stock market volatility and a few IPO flops have made investors more discerning of where they put their cash.
Ten IPOs have already hit stock markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa in 2018, raising $2.6 billion, an increase on the $1.2 billion raised in the same period a year earlier as deal sizes have increased, Thomson Reuters data showed.
A string of listings is expected to follow in the coming quarters. But in a sign of investor nervousness, Siemens' (DE:SIEGn) healthcare business - expected to be the biggest European IPO this year and one of Germany's biggest listings of the past decade - set a price range on Sunday which valued the company at a smaller than expected 31 billion euros ($38.13 billion).
""Investors are pushing back against aggressive valuations and showing much more price sensitivity because they are fed up with poor IPO after-market performance,"" a senior banker, who did not want to be named, said. 
This growing price sensitivity follows the burst of financial market volatility in January and February in which major stock markets - including the Euro STOXX 50 (STOXX50E) - fell 10 percent within a few days, fueled by inflation fears and expectations that interest rates could rise more quickly.
""The number of potential IPOs has basically accelerated, again. There's a lot in the pipeline,"" Ed Meier, fund manager at Old Mutual Global Investors, said.
""But I think it's fair to say that, given where we are in the (economic) cycle, the amount of potential outcomes in (company) forecasts, and the potential for those forecasts to be wrong, is much higher than it was.""
When deciding whether to invest in an IPO, fund managers assess a company's growth forecasts in its IPO prospectus. These form the basis for its valuation or price tag. If the outlook for economic growth turns downwards, these growth forecasts will be at risk.
Global investors cut their equity exposure to a three-month low after stock markets fell sharply early in February.
But the IPO pipeline remains fully stocked with companies lining up to take advantage of still attractive stock market valuations. 
In Germany,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) is set to come to market in March with a listing of its funds arm, which sources have said could raise up to 2 billion euros. 
On the London Stock Exchange there are a number of companies aiming to list, which could help the exchange sustain last year's strong recovery in IPO volumes after a slump in 2016 partly due to Britain's vote to leave the European Union. 
Private equity-backed tech firm Avast, online betting company SkyBet and education firm GEMs are lining up to list in London in the second or third quarters..
But companies' ability to raise their target amounts of money is set to get tougher.
""Money will get tighter ... there are some things that are going to be markedly more difficult to do,"" Adam Young, global head of equity advisory at Rothschild, said. 
Nick Burchett, head of UK equities at Cavendish Asset Management, said among London listings to go well last year was insurer Sabre (L:SBRE), whose shares rose 10 percent on its December market debut. But he also said that for every one that worked a number failed the fund manager's quality test.
""We've seen a few over the last few months where we've looked at them and thought... some of the valuations are a little bit rich. Is it the advisers that are just saying 'we can get it away for this. There's a bit of money sloshing around in the system'?""
The risk of over-paying has been highlighted by several high-profile IPO flops, including Austrian bank Bawag (VI:BAWG), the country's biggest ever listing, which fell in value on its first trading day. Bawag's shares are currently trading at around 44 euros, still below the 48 euro IPO price. 
Another to underwhelm was Angry Birds maker Rovio (HE:ROVIO), which issued a profit warning just months after its IPO in September, leaving investors nursing big losses.
Young from Rothshild said: ""Poor post-IPO after markets sometimes occur because sellers have over-ambitious valuation targets and push offer prices beyond the levels which the highest quality investors wish to support.""
""And sometimes IPOs are the victims of genuine bad luck and the side-effects of other issuers' mistakes,"" Young added. 

Whether 2018 becomes a record year for IPOs could depend in large part on where and if Saudi Arabia decides to list part of its national oil company, Saudi Aramco , itself the subject of fierce debate among investors about its price tag.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former drug company executive Martin Shkreli may have to give up a Picasso and a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album, after a U.S. judge on Monday ordered him to forfeit $7.36 million following his conviction of defrauding investors.
U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn said the assets Shkreli could forfeit to satisfy the judgment also include $5 million in a brokerage account and his stake in Vyera Pharmaceuticals, one of the drug companies he founded.
Shkreli is scheduled to be sentenced for securities fraud on Friday.
A lawyer for Shkreli could not immediately be reached for comment on the judge's order.
Shkreli, 34, has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered a $5,000 bounty for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
Shkreli became notorious as the ""Pharma Bro"" when he raised the price of anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015 while he was chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Turing is now Vyera.
In December 2015, Shkreli told Bloomberg Businessweek that he had bought the Wu-Tang Clan's ""Once Upon a Time in Shaolin"" when the hip-hop group auctioned the sole copy of the album to the highest bidder. Bloomberg reported that he paid $2 million for it.
Shkreli has also boasted of owning a Picasso painting.
A jury found Shkreli guilty last August of securities fraud charges unrelated to Daraprim. They determined that he lied to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He also was found guilty of conspiring to manipulate the stock price of another drug company he founded, Retrophin Inc (O:RTRX).
Shkreli's lawyers have asked that he be sentenced to 12 to 18 months in prison. They argued in a court filing that a lenient sentence is warranted partly because the investors eventually came out ahead when Shkreli paid them in stock and cash from Retrophin.
Matsumoto has already ruled that when Shkreli is sentenced, he will be held responsible for $10.4 million in losses, including all of the money his investors entrusted to his hedge funds. She said that regardless of the investors' ultimate gains, Shkreli got their money in the first place through fraud.

Although the $10.4 million loss will result in a higher recommended sentence under federal guidelines, Matsumoto is not required to follow those guidelines.

""This not only concerns Truck and Bus but the efficiency of the VW group as a whole,"" Mueller said.
VW has been pushing steps to cede power from global headquarters to brands and regions to become more nimble after its ""Dieselgate"" emissions scandal broke two and a half years ago.
But a review of its portfolio of assets and stakes announced in 2016 as part of VW's post-dieselgate transformation has yet to deliver results. A planned sale of Audi's (DE:NSUG) Italian motorcycle brand Ducati collapsed last year amid opposition from labor leaders.
""There are no decisions (on a trucks IPO),"" Mueller said. ""If there are decisions one day, then we will inform about those in a very qualified way.""

Separately, Mueller said he was ""very satisfied"" with the level of support for structural changes from the carmaker's supervisory board, without elaborating.

271,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Development bank EBRD has more than 10 European offers for new office,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - More than 10 countries have offered to host a new office for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, should it decide to move some of its staff out of London, the bank's finance chief, Andras Simor, said on Monday. 
Simor has been overseeing a review of the EBRD's London ""back office"" operations since late 2016. The review was originally expected to deliver some preliminary results last year but is still ongoing and could take another year or more. (http://reut.rs/2FoJgz5) 
""We want to do the right thing, timing is not the most important aspect of this,"" Simor told Reuters in an interview. 
Asked whether a decision was likely this year he added: ""Possibly, but we don't know, it could take longer.""
The EBRD currently employs over 1,500 staff in London and moving any significant number of them could prove costly and disruptive, but the bank at least has had plenty of offers from countries keen to host any new office.
""It's a long list,"" Simor said, adding that it ""probably"" had more than 10 names on it. He declined to detail them.
Set up by governments in 1991 to invest in the ex-communist economies of eastern Europe, the EBRD has expanded its mandate in the last decade and now operates in more than 30 countries.
Its founding charter stipulates it must be headquartered in London but Britain's vote to leave the European Union in 2016 has sparked debate among member states over whether its footprint should be spread.
There is no suggestion so far that the EBRD's headquarters would be moved from its base in central London
Simor's review is not directly related to Brexit, but if it does take a year or more as suggested, it would come right around the point next year when the UK is due to depart.
London is already bracing for a handful of departures by EU-wide organizations such as the European Banking Authority and European Medicines Agency and is also preparing to unpick its ties to Europe's biggest development bank, the European Investment Bank. 
The official reason for Simor's EBRD review is cost. 
The bank's profits dropped by almost a quarter last year though this was mainly down to currency fluctuations and longer-term hedging arrangements which should even out over time.
Another factor is that the lease on its current base in London expires in 2022. There have been talks to extend it for another five years, which could prove cheaper than splitting staff and renting two separate buildings.

""We are in the process of looking at options, whether we can, or want, to extend (lease) this building,"" Simor said. ""But we are also looking around London for alternatives.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's plans for a 25 percent tariff on U.S. imports of steel and 10 percent on aluminum have created a global outcry. The following explains why the use of these particular tariffs is so controversial among trade experts.
THE TARIFFS ARE GLOBAL
Unlike the punitive tariffs that the United States frequently imposes on ""dumped"" or unfairly subsidized goods from specified countries, Trump's steel and aluminum measures would apply to all countries. 
They are ""safeguard"" tariffs, a kind of emergency shield erected to stop a sudden, unforeseen and damaging import surge that could seriously damage a particular industry. Critics of Trump's plans say the U.S. steel and aluminum industries face no such threat.
Trump's tariffs cover a broad range of steel and aluminum products, suggesting they are not being applied conservatively. 
HARD TO CHALLENGE QUICKLY AND LEGALLY
Safeguard tariffs are legal under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, but the checks and balances on them are weak. 
They are meant to be accompanied by an offer of compensation for major supplier countries. Originally that implied a country imposing safeguards would lower tariffs on other goods to balance the economic impact. Nowadays that is less practical because many tariffs are already low.
So affected countries would be obliged to exact compensation by imposing tariffs or other measures on goods that they import from the United States. But they are not allowed to do so for three years. 
If the complainants go to the WTO and litigate, they may lose their right to compensation and simply open up years of legal wrangling. A tit-for-tat trade war may begin, as they impose unsanctioned measures to even up the score.
JUSTIFIED BY ""NATIONAL SECURITY""
Trump's tariffs are based on Section 232 of a 1962 U.S. law that allows safeguards based on ""national security"". 
Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford used Section 232 tariffs to tax foreign oil in 1971 and 1975, according to a study by law firm White & Case LLC. Section 232 has not been used since the WTO was created in 1995, although the U.S. government considered and rejected such action in 1999 and 2001. 
The WTO allows a national security exemption from its rules, but it has never been used as a defense in a trade dispute. It could arise in a current row between Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, but that dispute is effectively in limbo unless Qatar actively pushes ahead with the case.
A U.S. dispute involving national security would threaten WTO discipline, since other countries would probably follow suit and use it to justify their own claims to be exempt from the rules. 
Trump appeared to undermine the U.S. national security argument on Monday by tweeting that the tariffs would ""come off"" Mexico and Canada if they agreed a ""fair"" new deal in talks on the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  
COLLATERAL DAMAGE 
Although apparently intended to help U.S. steel and aluminum makers, the tariffs could lower profits for companies making everything from pickup trucks to canned soup, as well as increasing prices for consumers.
They also seem likely to damage U.S. allies such as Canada more than Trump's ultimate rival China. Many trade economists say Trump's zero-sum, ""mercantilist"" view of trade is misguided and that he is wrong to think trade deficits are always bad.
IMPACT ON WORLD TRADE SYSTEM?
The WTO is already on the verge of paralysis because the United States has vetoed new judicial appointments, letting the number of trade judges dwindle to four from the usual seven. 

A trade war triggered by safeguard tariffs would open a new wound in the global trading system, because it would unravel almost a quarter of a century of discipline and dethrone the WTO as the arbiter of global trade and a check on protectionism.

290,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",Former CEO of BRF arrested in Brazil food safety probe: police,"By Pedro Fonseca and Ana Mano
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Federal police said on Monday they arrested the former chief executive of Brazilian food processor BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) on charges that he and other executives were aware the company committed fraud in trying to evade food safety checks.
Shares in BRF, the country's largest chicken exporter, whose board and management were already under fire after the company posted its worst-ever annual results, plunged 15 percent. 
The company did not reply to emails and calls seeking comment. 
The charges open a new chapter in the federal police investigation of the Brazilian meat industry - dubbed ""Weak Flesh"" - which started in March 2017, wreaking havoc on the sector and temporarily closing export markets to Brazil, the world's largest beef and chicken exporter. 
In a statement, the police cited evidence that five laboratories accredited by the Agriculture Ministry colluded with the analysis department of BRF to ""falsify"" test results related to its industrial process.
Pedro Faria, BRF's chief executive between 2015 and 2017, was one of several people targeted in the new phase of the probe and was taken into custody in Curitiba, Paraná, police said.
""The fraud had the intention to cheat inspection services so as to prevent the Agriculture Ministry from controlling the quality of the industrial process of the company under investigation,"" the police said.
In a court ruling authorizing the arrests, Judge André Duszczak said Faria and other BRF officers sought to cover up claims of possible food contamination, as shown in certain laboratory tests, made by a former employee in a labor lawsuit.
A lawyer for Faria could not immediately be identified.
Maurício Moscardi Grillo, a federal police investigator, said officers ""at all hierarchical levels, from the chief executive to the quality control manager"" had knowledge of efforts to dodge food inspections and safety checks.
Hélio dos Santos Júnior, who resigned last week as vice president of global operations, was also taken into custody, the police said. 

Over the weekend, pension funds which are BRF's largest shareholders presented a list of 10 candidates for seats on the board in a bid to shake up the business. A BRF board meeting had been scheduled to take place on Monday, but it was not immediately clear if it was held.

(Reuters) - The second-largest U.S. nursing home operator, HCR ManorCare Inc, filed for Chapter 11 protection late Sunday with $7.1 billion of debt as part of a pre-arranged deal to transfer ownership to its landlord  Quality Care Properties Inc  (N:QCP).
Toledo, Ohio-based ManorCare, which operates skilled nursing, assisted living and memory care locations across the United States, had been battling with its landlord over unpaid rents since last year.
In a bankruptcy filing in Delaware, privately-owned ManorCare said revenues have failed to cover monthly rent obligations since 2012, a year after the master lease was signed. The lease covers 289 facilities.
It blamed shrinking margins at its post-acute and skilled nursing facilities on reduced government reimbursement rates, low occupancy, a shift toward new managed Medicare plans and alternative services such as home health care and retirement communities.
ManorCare said it owed $446 million in rent that was accruing at a minimum of $39.5 million every month.
The company was able to use profits from other growing businesses such as home health, hospice and outpatient rehab to help meet the rent until April 2017, when it defaulted on a prior credit facility.
Under the restructuring agreement reached last week, private equity owner  Carlyle Group  (O:CG) will hand over full ownership to Quality Care, which will give up its status as a real estate investment trust.
The deal includes a settlement agreement for ManorCare's former chief executive, Paul Ormond, who was owed more than $100 million when he stepped down in September.
ManorCare posted $3.7 billion in revenue in 2017, with 82 percent of it coming from its long-term care business, while its pre-tax loss from continuing operations totaled $268 million. Assets were worth $4.3 billion, it said.
The company has set aside $305 million to cover legal defense and settlement costs, including litigation for hundreds of claims against its long-term care business, for which it said it does not believe it is liable. 
The company is also facing four lawsuits by shareholders of its previous landlord  HCP Inc  (N:HCP), which in 2016 spun off the ManorCare real estate portfolio it had acquired from Carlyle in 2011. Carlyle bought ManorCare in a 2007 leveraged buyout.

A first-day Chapter 11 hearing will be held on Tuesday.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian bonds and banking stocks took the brunt of a market sell-off on Monday after a national election delivered a hung parliament and strong gains for anti-establishment parties.
The prospect of power passing to a eurosceptic coalition, which might boost spending in defiance of EU budget restrictions and row back on the previous government's market-friendly reforms, turned the spotlight on Italy's 2.3 trillion euro public debt pile, one of the world's biggest.
Its banks hold around 345 billion euros ($425 billion) of that debt and are considered a proxy for sovereign risk.
""Italy is far from having sorted its long-standing problems, and now it will have new ones,"" Lorenzo Codogno, founder of LC Macro Advisors, said. ""Be prepared for long and complex negotiations that will take months.""
By 1422 GMT Italy's main stock index (FTMIB) lost 1.3 percent as investors awaited more clarity on possible coalitions but took some comfort from an economic expansion that hit a seven-year high in 2017.
The banking index (FTIT8300) was 2.9 percent lower.
Benchmark 10-year bond yields  stood at 2.11 percent after rising to 2.14 percent at the open, their highest level since October.
Italian bond yields risked spiraling out of control during the sovereign debt crisis of 2011-2012 and were only reined in by the European Central Bank's ultra-expansionary policies, which are being scaled down.
With Bunds strengthened by the prospect of a new government in Germany after Social Democrats voted to join forces with Angela Merkel's conservatives, the yield premium Rome pays over  Berlin on 10-year debt rose to 1.54 percentage points, the highest since January.
""The spread refrain has started anew but who cares ... Italians decide when it comes to Italy ... markets have nothing to fear,"" said Matteo Salvini, head of the anti-immigrant League which emerged as the main party in a rightist alliance that got the biggest bloc of votes. 
UNCERTAINTY
Boosted by Italy's fastest growth in seven years and expectations of a tighter monetary policy, Italy's banking index hit a near two-year high in February after state rescues last year removed the threat of a systemic crisis.
The outgoing center-left government also passed measures to help lenders shed problem debts and encouraged mergers which are seen as necessary to beef up profits.
Italian lenders hold 300 billion euros in soured debts after a deep recession, and their shares are seen as cheap as they trade below the value of their assets.
After Monday's drop, the banking index is still 6.5 percent higher year-to-date but it is seen as vulnerable to a worsened economic outlook. 
""The prospect of a prolonged period of domestic political uncertainty risks weighing on the ongoing recovery,"" said Nicola Nobile of Oxford Economics. 
Mid-sized Italian banks with domestically focused operations and high bad loan burdens were worst hit. BPER Banca (MI:EMII) lost 6.4 percent, Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) 5.3 percent and UBI Banca (MI:UBI) 4 percent. 
Heavyweights  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) and UniCredit (MI:CRDI) lost only around 2 percent.
The 5-Star Movement that won the most votes of any party has promised to compensate further small savers left out of pocket by a string of banking crises, and wants to split lenders' commercial and investment banking businesses.
""Although the season of bank bailouts is virtually over, Italy should not let its guard down,"" Lazard's Managing Director Massimo Pappone said. ""Key issues are at stake: bank lending ... and the handling of so-called unlikely-to-pay loans (to borrowers in trouble but not yet insolvent), which can be a lever to support the economy.""
Another notable Italian loser, with shares dropping 6 percent, was broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), which is controlled by the Berlusconi family and is mired in a legal spat with French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV) over a derailed pay-TV deal.
Berlusconi's party's poor results in the election are seen weakening Mediaset's bargaining power.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Monday as fears of a global trade war ebbed with investors betting that U.S. President Donald Trump would back down on his threat to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Strategists also cited rising oil prices and ebbing concerns after an Italian election for a relief rally in the three major U.S. equity indexes. 
Investors started to eye Trump's threat as a negotiating tool after he tweeted that Canada and Mexico could avoid his proposed tariffs if they ceded ground in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) talks. 
A lack of specific retaliatory measures from other countries was also reassuring, said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist, Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in New York.

330,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 07:11AM ET</span>",Special Report: Fidelity puts 6 million savers on risky path to retirement,"By Tim McLaughlin and Renee Dudley
BOSTON (Reuters) - For three years, the mutual funds in Fidelity's flagship retirement franchise have outperformed at least 85 percent of their competitors, reversing a decade-long trend of subpar performance.
And yet client money has continued to flow out of the firm's Freedom Funds as retirement plan sponsors shift workers’ savings to rivals in the target-date fund business.
While deposits in the trillion-dollar sector have surged, Fidelity has seen nearly $16 billion in net withdrawals over the past four years, according to research firm Morningstar Inc.
The exodus stems in part from unease with the way Boston-based Fidelity has boosted performance - by ramping up risk.
Since a strategy overhaul that took full effect in 2014, Fidelity has substantially increased exposure to stocks, including those from volatile emerging markets. The firm also scrapped a long-held belief of sticking to pre-set allocations of stocks, bonds and other assets in target-date funds.
Instead, Fidelity portfolio managers now try to time market shifts, for instance by moving billions of dollars out of money-losing commodities bets and into Chinese stocks and U.S. tech shares, regulatory filings show.
Such changes have worked well in the second-longest running bull market in U.S. history, but they expose investors to bigger losses if the funds’ increasingly volatile assets head south.
In the 1990s, Fidelity helped pioneer target-date funds as a prudent method to diversify investments and automatically dial down risk as participants age. The fund names typically include a projected retirement year - the target date.
Today, many target-date fund managers have turned to riskier investments to boost returns, and Fidelity has gone further than its peers, said Ron Surz, president of research firm Target Date Solutions.
“These funds with high concentrations in stocks are a time bomb,” Surz said.
The sector is even riskier today than during the 2008 financial crisis, when some funds dropped more than 40 percent, he said.
Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said today’s American savers can handle more risk because they retire later and live longer, allowing more time to recover losses.
""The Freedom Funds are a lifetime savings solution,"" he said, that ""deliver exceptional performance for shareholders taking appropriate risks.""
A recent global market sell-off underscored how Fidelity's growing appetite for risk could amplify investor losses.
The Freedom 2020 Fund (O:FFFDX) - for investors two years from retirement - fell 6 percent between Jan. 26th and Feb. 8th, performing worse than 81 percent of competitors' similar target-date funds, according to Morningstar.
The sharp downturn reflects Fidelity’s decision to keep 60 percent of 2020 investors' money in stocks compared to an average of 40 percent in similar funds for older savers, according to Morningstar.
The 2040 fund (O:FFFFX), for mid-career savers, tumbled 9 percent during that period, lagging 87 percent of rivals, after outperforming almost all competitors over the past year as stocks generally surged. The 2060 fund (O:FDKVX) for young investors did better, beating 60 percent of rivals during the market sell-off.
Loporchio said such short-term swings do not reflect what Fidelity's retirement savers will see over the long term. With its 2014 strategy changes, Fidelity needed to address a longstanding problem with underperformance of Freedom Funds, Loporchio said.
“When Fidelity products yield disappointing returns, we work relentlessly to improve them,” he said.
In the decade before the changes, Freedom Funds largely failed to beat or match their internal benchmarks, set by Fidelity, over one-, three-, five- and 10-year spans, according to a Reuters analysis of the firm's performance data. Had the funds been a sports team, their record against benchmarks would have been six wins, 40 losses and one tie.
(For a graphic detailing Fidelity's falling market share and historic underperformance, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2CUPTol )
About 6.2 million Americans have about $224 billion invested in Freedom Funds, Fidelity’s largest retirement fund franchise. The funds account for about 10 percent of the firm’s assets under management and generate fee revenue approaching $1 billion annually.
But the funds’ market share has plunged to 21 percent of total target-date fund assets, down from 43 percent at the end of 2008, according to Morningstar Inc data.
Of the top five target-date providers, Fidelity was the only one to have net withdrawals in 2016 and 2017, according to Morningstar data. By contrast, the target date industry as a whole racked up $129 billion in net deposits during those two years.
‘CHAOTIC’ CHANGES
Retirement plan sponsors and consultants who have pulled money from Freedom Funds told Reuters that they lost faith in Freedom Funds because of their history of underperformance, frequent strategy changes and rising risk.
Dassault Systemes, a French software company with U.S. operations, is among those who dumped Freedom Fund investments soon after the strategy revamp. Fidelity’s “tinkering” with the funds’ methodology for dialing down investor risk over time raised concerns about the funds’ management, said Longfellow Advisors, an outside consultant hired by Dassault, in a report to the company.
“It was not clear to us that they knew what they were doing,” Kendall Storch, a Longfellow principal who consulted Dassault on the change, told Reuters in an interview.
Plan sponsors dumping Freedom Funds more recently include a host of college retirement systems that shifted money in 2017 to target-date funds offered by Vanguard, according to announcements by the plans. They included Central Florida University, Dartmouth College, Duke University, Santa Clara University and the University of Virginia Physicians Group Retirement Plan.
El Camino Hospital in Silicon Valley replaced Freedom Funds with T. Rowe Price’s target date offering in 2015, citing historic underperformance and the new “attempt to time global markets,” according to a February 2015 investment committee meeting report.
“Fidelity has made a lot of changes all at once,” said Scott Cameron, chief investment officer at retirement consultant Multnomah Group, which advised El Camino Hospital on the change. “It does cause clients to pause.""
It’s not the first time Fidelity has been criticized for strategy changes that unsettled investors and analysts. When Morningstar looked at Fidelity’s changes in the allocation of stocks between 1996 and 2010, they described them as “shocking” and “seemingly chaotic,” according to a 2011 Morningstar report on the target-date fund industry.
Fidelity said its new market-timing strategy, which it calls “active asset allocation,” can capitalize on finding underpriced assets over a 1-to-5 year time horizon. Since 2014, Freedom Fund portfolio managers have had discretion to adjust allocations in major asset classes by up to 10 percentage points in either direction.
Loporchio said that the investment management for a target-date fund “should be flexible and adaptable, to evolve and respond to changes in both the capital markets and investor needs.”
TRYING TO 'NOT LOSE MONEY'
Fidelity has historically frowned on market-timing strategies in retirement funds, saying they had a “low probability of repeated success,” according to a 2009 presentation Fidelity gave to the Vermont state and municipal retirement system. Reuters obtained the slide deck through a public records request.
Instead, Fidelity restricted Freedom Fund managers to pre-determined asset allocation formulas, with specified percentages of stocks, bonds or other assets.
The Freedom Funds, launched in 1996, dominated the sector for years. As the top U.S. record keeper for 401(k) and other defined contribution retirement plans, Fidelity had outsized influence on what investment options were offered to workers at hospitals, municipalities, publicly-traded companies and universities.
But the funds lost ground in the mid-2000s as rival Vanguard Group overtook them with its cheaper index target-date funds.
Until the changes in 2014, Fidelity funds held higher concentrations of more conservative investments such as bonds, aimed at protecting investors against the downside risk of market cataclysms.
Even with a more conservative asset mix than Freedom Funds have today, Fidelity struggled to control the damage from the 2008 financial crisis, when the funds performed as poorly as the rest of the sector, losing 41 percent for the youngest savers and 25 percent for those near retirement.
This time around, Freedom Funds are more exposed to equities and other higher-risk assets, according to analysts and a Reuters review of Fidelity’s U.S. regulatory filings.
And the stakes are much higher now: The popular target-date fund sector now has more than $1 trillion in assets under management - or more than five times as much as before the 2008 meltdown.
Despite Fidelity's rapid loss of market share, Freedom Fund assets have more than doubled in the past decade as the stock values surged.
Fidelity has gone further than competitors in boosting risk to juice returns in a low-interest rate environment, fund disclosures show.
For example, Fidelity’s Freedom 2020 Fund - marketing to people retiring in about two years - has 60 percent of its assets in equities.
By contrast, 2020 funds run by T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW), Vanguard Group and American Funds have 58.5 percent, 55 percent and 49 percent, respectively, in equities, fund holding disclosures show.
Fidelity's 2020 fund includes 6.4 percent of its $31 billion in net assets in emerging market equities, such as Chinese stocks, according to company disclosures. That's up from about 1 percent a decade ago in an similar Fidelity fund for older savers, according to a returns-based estimates by software and research firm Markov Processes International Inc.
The current exposure is significantly higher than the category average of about 4 percent in 2020 funds, according to MPI's analysis.
Emerging markets, in particular, can be more volatile than the U.S. stock market because they can feature foreign currency exchange risk, political instability and limited liquidity. In the summer of 2015, for example, the Shanghai Composite Index (SSEC) fell more than 40 percent in a sell-off that reverberated around the globe amid worries about China’s slowing economy.
Freedom Fund portfolio managers and quants are experimenting with artificial intelligence and algorithms similar to ones used by hedge funds to identify hidden shifts in the market to adjust investment allocations, according to Fidelity’s published research.
The changes have paid off in the short run, with Freedom Funds’ 1-year and 3-year returns beating internal benchmarks. Fidelity also credited junk bonds for helping bolster returns, according to portfolio manager commentary posted on its website.
In the long run, the biggest risk in target-date funds is that they won't meet investor expectations for avoiding losses, said Morningstar analyst Jeff Holt.
The funds, he said, are so popular in part because investors believe they are designed to “not lose money.""

331,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",Online lender Kabbage to restrict weapons lending,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Kabbage Inc, a U.S. online lender for small businesses, said it will cut ties with clients that make or sell assault-style rifles or that sell weapons or ammunition to people under 21 years old, one of the strongest steps by any financial firm after last month's high school massacre in Florida.
""We believe this is an issue of health and safety in the general population,"" said Rob Frohwein, chief executive of the Atlanta-based financial technology company that made loans to tens of thousands of customers last year. 
""We don't want to impose our beliefs on someone else, but we're also not required legally to be participating"" in such lending, Frohwein said in a telephone interview Friday evening.
Kabbage's steps go further than bigger financial companies including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), which said on Feb 24 that it would speak with such clients ""to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility"" to end mass shootings.
Bank of America spokespeople have since declined to offer more details about what else the bank might do. Last week large retailers announced new restrictions on gun sales including Dick's Sporting Goods and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT)
On Friday BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the largest U.S. asset manager, described a series of tough questions it planned to ask gunmakers and retailers following the shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 people dead.
Kabbage, which aims to automate lending by using data generated by small businesses' bookkeeping systems, is not as well-known as the larger firms. 
But its move is more than symbolic because it will affect current clients unless they change their practices. 
The company says it made 250,000 loans to roughly 50,000 different customers in 2017, originating a total of $1.5 billion. It counts investors including Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T) Reverence Capital Partners, and Thomvest Ventures. The company's board including members from those companies is supportive of its action, Frohwein said.
Frohwein said its clients likely include both specialty gun shops and stores such as pawnshops or sporting-goods retailers where weapons are not the main business. It is still identifying which clients would face changes under the new terms, and plans to speak with them starting on Monday.

""Our goal is not to put anyone out of business or cause any harm to those businesses,"" Frohwein said.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Gokulnath Shetty, a middle-aged bank manager of middling rank, spent his days in the foreign exchange department on the mezzanine floor of Punjab National Bank's Brady House branch in Mumbai.
It was there, past the loan desk and up a flight of stairs, that federal police say Shetty hatched India's largest-ever bank fraud, which the bank values at nearly $2 billion and says was engineered between 2011 and 2017.
The room where Shetty worked was visited on a quarterly basis by external auditors approved by the central bank, who sifted through documents but failed to spot any problem, according to interviews with two bank employees with first-hand knowledge of the department's operations.
In the three weeks since details of the alleged fraud was disclosed, Indian authorities and the media have squarely blamed  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK), and a group of high-flying jewelers including diamond tycoon Nirav Modi.
But Reuters has uncovered new evidence that shows the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) also failed for years to either detect the fraud, respond adequately to red flags in the banking system, or correct a breakdown of normal practices at the nation's second-largest state-run bank. The RBI is in charge of supervising lenders and meant to act as the bottom-line guarantor that the banking system is sound.
That heightens worries about what other problems might lurk within India's state-run lenders, which hold some 70 percent of the sector's assets in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
The RBI, presented with a list of findings and questions for this story sent to a spokesman, did not respond.
Punjab National did not respond to a similar request.
Shetty's lawyer, Vikram Sutaria, said his client ""is not guilty"".
HANDS-OFF APPROACH
Interviews with 12 current and former officials at the RBI and senior executives at some of the country's largest banks, and a review of dozens of pages of internal central bank circulars, reveal a system that in many cases had little hope of catching criminal activity.
The reporting shows: 
- The RBI takes a hands-off approach: Its inspections concentrate on whether the broader systems are sound, not the details of what's happening in a particular banking operation.
- External auditors approved by the RBI, known as statutory auditors, in many cases only do top line reviews, not in-depth inspections. In Punjab National's case they have been changed regularly - 18 different firms used over seven years. Though the auditors swapped hand-off notes, no one auditor was able to delve into the bank's operations for any extended period.
- Those external auditors met with Shetty, but their audits of Punjab National published in the bank's annual reports from 2011 to 2017 did not raise alarms.
- The RBI knew by 2016 there was a laundry list of problems at Indian banks that the central bank said ""exposed the bank to heightened risk of fraudulent activities"".
- The central bank did not compel state banks to link their banking software with the SWIFT global interbank messaging network, a key vulnerability in the Punjab National fraud.
""SHETTY SIR""
A current senior RBI official involved in the scrutiny of banks acknowledged there were shortcomings.
""This has been going on for six years and nobody pointed it out - not the auditors and not the RBI inspection,"" he said.
In Punjab National Bank's initial criminal complaint, and then court documents filed in February by India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), deputy manager Shetty is accused of having sent letters of undertaking, essentially credit guarantees, over the SWIFT network without logging those transactions in the bank's internal software. 
Two internal auditors who sat with Shetty in the branch have also been arrested, among more than a dozen people picked up by law enforcement so far.
Asked about the specifics of allegations against Shetty, who has been arrested but not charged, his lawyer, Sutaria, declined to discuss them.
The alleged beneficiaries of the transactions were companies controlled by Nirav Modi, whose diamond creations have glimmered across the flesh of film stars, and his uncle Mehul Choksi, who also owns a large jewelry operation. Neither man has been charged with a crime. Both are currently outside the country and have denied the allegations.
Two co-workers described Shetty as a socially taciturn man who, after starting the work day by moisturizing his face and hands with Pond's cream, began sipping a seemingly endless series of cups of tea and dialing up customers on his iPhone.
Shetty, they said, declined to show others how to operate the SWIFT system.
    ""No one would work on SWIFT in his absence,"" said one of the co-workers. ""Even customers used to say if 'Shetty sir' is not around let's not proceed with anything.""
Representatives of Modi, the jeweler, would spend hours in the office, sometimes eating lunch there, two employees at the branch said. ""It was as if they were bank employees,"" said one banker who still works in the currency exchange office.
AUDIT FRAMEWORK
The framework for auditing India's banks is set up to provide three levels of scrutiny: continuous monitoring by internal auditors, quarterly inspection by statutory auditors and an annual inspection by the RBI, according to interviews with officials at the central bank.
The bank's cornerstone internal, or concurrent auditors, are expected to run daily checks on all SWIFT transactions, according to RBI officials.
But a former senior RBI official with direct knowledge of the central bank's oversight of foreign exchange transactions said they often do not provide much of a backstop. 
""Sometimes the concurrent auditor just blindly signs whatever is given to him without verifying what is going on,"" the official said.
Asked about the RBI's annual audit, a current official who previously worked in its supervision division said the central bank has moved away from doing annual branch inspections, instead relying primarily on data from the lender's headquarters.
""Earlier, the branches of banks were at least scared that RBI might catch any malpractice,"" the official said.
R. Gandhi, deputy governor at the RBI from 2014 to 2017, said the statutory audit process, which is carried out by private accounting firms, was not meant to be comprehensive.
""A 100 percent audit is specified only for high-risk areas,"" he said.
Explaining the RBI's approach overall, he added: ""We are supervisors. The prime objective of RBI's audit should be to see that systems and procedures are there and those are functioning.""
Two of the RBI-approved statutory auditors who inspected the Mumbai branch confirmed they met Shetty in the foreign exchange room.
One auditor, who inspected the branch on a quarterly basis between October 2011 and September 2012, said he raised the question of why Nirav Modi was getting so much credit.
The auditor, who asked not to be named, said his concerns were raised to the bank's audit committee but he was told by Punjab National executives: ""Let this go this time, we will note this and take steps.""
The details, he said, would have been available to RBI officials through his subsequent report, but as far as he was aware no action was taken.
Reuters called the other 16 accounting firms listed in the bank's annual report from the 2010-11 fiscal year to the most recent. The calls were either unanswered or met with refusal to discuss particulars of the audits.
WARNING SIGNS
Documents show that the RBI knew more than a year before the current scandal that there were warning signs about how Indian banks administered the SWIFT network.
Transactions such as the letters of undertaking sent by Shetty result in credit being given to a borrower in an account known as a ""nostro"", which is owned by the issuing bank - in this case Punjab National - but hosted by another bank overseas.
     A letter on Aug. 3, 2016 from the RBI to bank executives warned of ""a recent incident involving attempted unauthorized transfer of funds from the nostro account of a bank"".
The RBI asked the top management of Indian banks to not only ensure that appropriate controls were in place, but also to reconcile their nostro account transactions – that is, to check that they matched their banks' internal records.
A Nov. 25, 2016 letter from the RBI listed what it described as problems that banks reported after receiving the August communication - a number of which were to show up in the Punjab National case.
     Several Indian state-run banks had followed a ""decentralized set up for SWIFT"", meaning that multiple branches and, as a result, ""significantly higher number of users"" had access to sending money across the global network.
In some cases, the RBI said, that meant more than 1,000 people being able to log on, which ""exposed the bank to heightened risk of fraudulent activities"".
     Several banks, the RBI wrote, had ""no/little audit oversight on the SWIFT framework despite significant financial ramifications"".
Last month, after the fraud was discovered, the reserve bank set a April 30 deadline for integrating banks' internal software and SWIFT.
Most big global banks began to connect SWIFT - originally standalone terminals like the telex machines they replaced - to their central systems in the 1990s.

Three executives with experience of the cash payments industry said this means transactions are automatically recorded and reconciled within the bank and, ideally, with counterparties. The chief executive officer of SWIFT from 1992 until 2007, Leonard Schrank, said: ""I can't imagine not incorporating SWIFT payments as part of overall reconciliation.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has fined ex-Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) trader Guillaume Adolph 180,000 pounds ($249,000) for ""improperly influencing"" quotes used for the Libor interest rate benchmark, and banned him from working in finance 
Banks have been fined billions of dollars for trying to rig the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, which is denominated in several currencies and used to price trillions of dollars in financial products from home loans to credit cards.
""Mr Adolph improperly influenced several of Deutsche’s Libor submissions in disregard of standards governing Libor submissions,"" Mark Steward, the FCA's director of enforcement, said in a statement on Monday.
""Mr Adolph’s misconduct threatened the integrity of important benchmarks. He should have no further role in the financial services industry,"" Steward said.
Adolph's lawyer, BCL Solicitors, said the events occurred nearly a decade ago and Adolph wishes to move on with this life outside financial services.
""Thus, while he does not admit the FCA's findings, Mr Adolph has waived his right to contest that he was concerned in a breach of an FCA principle by  Deutsche Bank , his former employer,"" BCL Solicitors said in a statement.
""The FCA does not conclude or even suggest that he was dishonest. As the FCA has previously found, the blame for the problems associated with Libor within Deutsche Bank lies firmly at the door of the bank,"" BCL said.
Deutsche Bank had no immediate comment.
The FCA said it found that between July 2008 and March 2010 Adolph made requests to Deutsche Swiss Libor submitters to adjust their quotes to benefit his own trading positions.
He also took his own trading positions into account when acting as Deutsche's primary yen Libor submitter, the FCA alleged.
Adolph improperly agreed with a trader at another Libor submitting bank to make yen Libor submissions which took into account that trader's requests, the FCA said.
""The FCA has found that Mr Adolph closed his mind to the risk that these actions were improper. He was also knowingly concerned in Deutsche’s failure to observe proper standards of market conduct,"" the watchdog said.

The FCA issued Adolph with a notice in January 2014 for the actions it was taking, but proceedings were put on hold due to an ongoing criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into certain individuals who formerly worked at Deutsche Bank.

339,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",World's 'shadow banks' continue to expand,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Growth in global bond, real estate and money market funds continued to swell the world's ""shadow banking"" sector, a watchdog that coordinates financial regulation for the G20 big economies said on Monday.
The Financial Stability Board said its ""narrow"" measure of shadow banking activities that could pose a threat to stability, rose 7.6 percent to $45.2 trillion in 2016, the latest year for which figures have been collated.
It represents 13 percent of total financial system assets in the 29 jurisdictions surveyed. Data from China and Luxembourg were included in the measure for the first time.
""Non-bank financing provides a valuable alternative to bank financing and helps support real economic activity,"" the FSB said in its report. Nevertheless, increased reliance on non-bank funding could give rise to new risks, it said.
The so-called shadow banking sector, made up of companies other than banks that provide financial services, has been treated with suspicion by some regulators since the financial crisis a decade ago.
Still, it has some champions among policymakers who say it helps keep capital markets more liquid. The European Union actively courts participants to diversify away from heavy reliance on bank loans for EU companies.
Apart from debt investment funds, the measure of shadow banking also includes the repurchase and debt securitization markets as well as hedge funds involved in credit.
Faced with few rules in the past, sub-sectors like securitization are now regulated and seen to pose less risk to stability.
Open-ended bond funds, hedge funds that offer credit and money market funds account for 72 percent of the narrow measure, and grew by 11 percent in 2016.
Regulators have asked funds to have safeguards in place for extreme market turbulence to avoid instability from fire sales of assets if many investors ask for their money back.
The United States accounts for 31 percent of the narrow measure, followed by China with 16 percent, the Cayman Islands at 10 percent and Japan at 6 percent.
A broader measure, which includes all financial firms that are not central banks, banks, pension funds or insurers, rose 8 percent to $99 trillion to represent 30 percent of global financial assets, its highest level since at least 2002, the FSB said.

342,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Markets May Need to Buckle Up for Trade Tensions Over Long Haul,"(Bloomberg) -- The angst about rising trade tensions that’s hit equity markets may presage a prolonged conflict, considering that when it comes to China, the Trump administration may have greater ambitions than just a more advantageous commercial arrangement.
While Chinese officials have pressed for a list of specific demands as President Donald Trump prepares to execute measures including tariffs, there may be no such theoretical list, if this prism of analysis is correct.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) says the risks are now skewing toward a ""protectionist push"" scenario that roils stocks.
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office, along with national security officials labeling China a ""strategic competitor"" ultimately aren’t interested in things such as greater market access for American companies, says Arthur Kroeber, head of research at economic consultancy Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing. Instead, these Trump administration elements are engaging in an effort to contain the growing sway of a state-driven Chinese economic model on the global stage, he argues.
No Bargain
""The USTR is not trying to bargain with Beijing: it is trying to force a deep change in behavior,"" Kroeber wrote in a March 2 note. The policy ""is to either get China to dismantle its industrial-policy edifice and conduct its economy more along Western lines, or failing that, ensure the U.S. defeats China in the race for technological supremacy.""
Kroeber added that ""the odds are that the trade and security hawks will have the better of the battle in 2018"" in the administration, unless supporters of globalization such as White House economic adviser Gary Cohn can organize greater support from U.S. companies with major China operations that could be under threat.
Morgan Stanley analysts are more sanguine for now, anticipating a measured international response to the U.S.’s latest move to put tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. A move to sanction China on intellectual property protection could tip the balance toward tensions, however.
For U.S. stocks, ""a material escalation toward protectionism would involve additional risks, increase volatility further, and likely dampen broader risk appetite,"" Morgan Stanley strategists Michael Zezas and Meredith Pickett wrote in a note Monday. That scenario would also mean ""downside"" for Treasury yields this year, they wrote.

LONDON (Reuters) - Franklin Templeton's David Zahn said on Monday that he would look for more certainty on the make-up of the next Italian government before reassessing his underweight position on Italian bonds. 
Italy faces a prolonged period of political instability after voters delivered a hung parliament in Sunday's election, spurning traditional parties and flocking to anti-establishment and far-right groups in record numbers.
""We are underweight Italy at the moment and anticipated there would be some volatility,"" Zahn told Reuters. ""We would look for some more certainty before we consider any changes.""
Zahn is Franklin Templeton's head of European fixed income and manages more than 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) of assets.
He said the weighting of Italian bonds held in the flagship Franklin European Total Return Fund was 7.50 percent compared to its benchmark, the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Euro Aggregate Index which had a 15.60 percent weighting for Italian bonds.
Zahn added that he remained optimistic about the economic ""fundamentals"" in Italy, the euro zone's third biggest economy. 
But he said he was worried about the fiscal policies of the next government. 
""The main concern for me is what coalition comes out of this election,"" Zahn said. 
""The one thing that is clear to me is that the establishment are not well liked by the population and therefore I expect spending to be increased. Given Italy's fiscal dynamics, this is concerning.""
At 132 percent of GDP, Italy has the European Union's worst debt ratio after Greece.
Italian government bond yields rose sharply on Monday in the wake of the election results, with investors positioning for a period of political instability. 
Italy's 10-year bond yield was trading at 2.09 percent, up 5 basis points on the day.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 07:06AM ET</span>","Trump auto tax threat hits BMW, Daimler","LONDON (Reuters) - Investors sold shares in BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) on Monday after President Donald Trump said the U.S. may tax imports of European cars if the EU retaliates against his plan to impose tariffs on aluminium and steel. 
The United States is a big buyer of coupes, sports cars and sedans made by the German premium carmakers, such as Daimler's Mercedes S-Class and BMW's 7 Series, and accounts for a big chunk of their global profits. 
It is also a big manufacturing base for their bigger sport-utility vehicles including the Mercedes GLE and BMW X5, many of which are shipped to Asia and Europe.
This makes them especially vulnerable if Trump's protectionist moves spark retaliation by the world's other big trading blocs. 
Daimler shares were already under pressure last week over fears that Trump's planned steel tariffs would hit the profitability of its U.S. truckmaking business -- trucks use more steel than cars.
""With the steel and aluminium ban we weren't expecting a really big effect"" on the carmakers, said one autos analyst. ""This is a bit more serious."" 
Daimler stock fell a further 0.5 percent on Monday, while BMW dropped 1.2 percent while European shares (STOXX) were up 0.7 percent on average. 
""At the moment, we presume that (Trump's auto import tax threat) is merely sabre rattling,"" Evercore analysts wrote in a note. 
""However, were it to materialize into policy, under our coverage, the greatest financial impact would likely be at BMW, followed by VW and Daimler.""
The first analyst pointed out that, among German carmakers, BMW has the fewest favourable broker ratings so its shares were less likely than rivals to find buying support as their price falls.
Volkswagen's premium Audi brand makes cars for the U.S. market in Mexico, whose trade relationship with its rich northern neighbour is also increasingly uncertain. 
But VW group's U.S. earnings contribution, hit hard by its Dieselgate emissions scandal, is minimal. 
""We believe that  Porsche  has a strong chance of pricing through any incremental duties, at least partially, and the U.S. is less material to Audi than its peers,"" said Evercore analysts. 
VW stock was up 0.4 percent while shares in VW group's sportscar affiliate Porsche Automobil Holding (DE:PSHG_p) were unchanged. 
German carmakers said on Monday that a trade war between the United States and Europe ""must be avoided at all costs"", expressing their profound concern after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to tax car imports.

346,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2018 09:29AM ET</span>","Trump trade threats alarm German carmakers, hit investor morale","By Ilona Wissenbach and Michael Nienaber
FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - German car companies urged policymakers on Monday to avoid a trade war with the United States ""at all costs"" after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to tax car imports from the European Union.
The United States is the second-biggest export destination for German auto manufacturers after China, while vehicles and car parts are Germany's biggest source of export income.
""Punitive duties can't be the answer,"" Bernhard Mattes, president of Germany's VDA automotive industry association, said in a statement.
""A trade war between the USA and Europe must be avoided at all costs. In such a trade war there are only losers on all sides.""
Analysts fear a full-blown trade war between the United States and Europe could cut growth in Germany, the biggest EU economy, by up to 1 percentage point.
This concern was also mirrored in a Sentix survey on Monday that showed investor morale in the euro zone fell further in March due to concerns about rising protectionism under Trump.
Sentix's index for the euro zone dropped to 24.0 in March from 31.9 in February, far short of the average forecast of 31.0 in a Reuters poll. It marked the second consecutive monthly decline and the lowest level since April 2017.
""The comments by U.S. President Donald Trump about introducing tariffs on certain products have not only alarmed the European Commission. Investors are also clearly reacting,"" Sentix researcher Manfred Huebner said.
Trump said on Thursday the United States would apply duties of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum to protect U.S. producers. The European Commission called the step a blatant intervention that amounted to protectionism and it raised the prospect of counter-measures.
Trump kept up the pressure over the weekend, threatening European automakers with an import tax if the EU retaliated in response to his plan for tariffs on metals.
Sentix's index solely tracking Germany fell to 29.1 from 36.2 last month, while an expectations index for Germany dropped to -2.5 from 5.5, hitting the lowest level since February 2016.
""The German growth engine is clearly starting to stutter,"" Huebner said, adding Trump's protectionist rhetoric was clouding the mood among investors.
The VDA, which represents automakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), pointed out that their auto production in the United States at 804,000 vehicles was greater than their exports from Germany and was growing.
German exports amounted to 494,000 cars last year - a fall of a quarter since 2013. Over the same period, German carmakers increased local staff levels in the U.S. market by nearly a fifth to 36,500 jobs.
More than half of the vehicles made in the United States by German carmakers are exported, the VDA added, supporting the U.S. foreign trade balance.
Trump's threat to launch a trade war has encountered resistance from fellow Republicans, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, where a BMW plant employs 9,000 workers.
The carmakers' remarks were echoed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government spokesman who said Germany wanted to avoid a trade war with the United States because it believed such a conflict would be in nobody's interest.

Spokesman Steffen Seibert said Europe would respond appropriately to any punitive tariffs the Trump administration imposes and Berlin would consult with France, the European Commission and other partners.

The trucks board debated whether to turn the legal structure into a Societas Europea (SE) or a German stock corporation (AG), but no decision had been taken, the source added.
Volkswagen's Truck & Bus division, which houses the MAN and Scania brands, may follow a wider trend among carmakers and suppliers to dismantle conglomerates into more specialized businesses.
Such a step would however require the approval of the carmaker's supervisory board, which has the power to block major changes to Volkswagen's corporate structure.
Handelsblatt and Bloomberg reported at the weekend that VW discussed changing the corporate designation of its Trucks operations.
A spokeswoman for Volkswagen's Trucks division declined to comment on Sunday, reiterating that managers have said a separate listing is among the strategic options.

The VW Truck and Bus division was not available for comment.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Sunday ordered  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) to delay its March 6 shareholder meeting, a highly unusual request that will allow time for a national security review of the deal, but that also cast new doubt on Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd's (O:AVGO) $117-billion bid for its U.S. semiconductor peer. 
The intervention highlights growing U.S. concerns about safeguarding semiconductor technology. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews deals for potential national security concerns, does not typically review mergers before companies have clinched an agreement.
CFIUS asked Qualcomm to postpone its shareholder meeting, that had been scheduled for Tuesday, by 30 days. Reuters had reported last week that CFIUS had begun looking at Broadcom's bid amid growing pressure from politicians, including senior Republican Senator John Cornyn.
""This measure will afford CFIUS the ability to investigate fully Broadcom's proposed acquisition of Qualcomm,"" the U.S. Department of Treasury, which oversees CFIUS, said in a statement.
As the semiconductor industry is locked in a race to develop chips that power so-called 5G wireless technology, allowing the transmission of data at faster speeds, San Diego-based Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to Chinese companies vying for market share in the sector, such as Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], making it a prized asset.
A source familiar with CFIUS thinking said that if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within ten years, ""there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that's essentially Huawei, and then the American carriers would have no choice. They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).""
Additionally, U.S. officials speaking on the condition of anonymity said members of Congress and Federal Communications Commission officials are concerned Broadcom could sell part of Qualcomm to a Chinese firm, a move that could hurt the U.S. effort to develop 5G wireless technology because of the small existing number of suppliers that build the hardware. 
A CFIUS review in itself does not mean a deal will be halted. CFIUS, under former President Barack Obama and current President Donald Trump, has soured on high-tech deals, particularly involving semiconductors, or involving sensitive information about American citizens.
Part of the CFIUS' current concern, which is echoed in a letter Cornyn sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, could lie in the fact that Broadcom has failed to strike a deal with Qualcomm and has resorted to what is essentially a hostile takeover by putting forward a slate of six Broadcom nominees for Qualcomm's 11-member board.
Broadcom shares fell 1.3 percent in late trading, while Qualcomm fell 0.8 percent.
Broadcom has struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm as the latter has resisted, citing several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles.
Broadcom said on Monday that CFIUS' intervention was the result of secret moves made by Qualcomm on Jan. 29 to seek an investigation into the offer, which Qualcomm's board has said significantly undervalues the company.
But Qualcomm, in a press statement, said ""Broadcom's claims that the CFIUS inquiry was a surprise to them has no basis in fact"" and that Broadcom had been interacting with CFIUS ""for weeks.""
Before Broadcom disclosed its buyout offer for Qualcomm in November, U.S. President Donald Trump himself announced Broadcom's plan to shift its headquarters back to the United States after a White House meeting with Chief Executive Hock Tan.
Trump praised the move at the time, calling Broadcom ""one of the really great, great companies.""
U.S. Senator Tom Cotton said on Monday he backed the panel's decision to delay a Qualcomm shareholder meeting, saying ""Qualcomm's work is too important to our national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company.""
MOVING BACK TO THE U.S.
Broadcom said on Monday it is run by a board and senior management team consisting almost entirely of Americans and is largely owned by the same U.S. institutional investors that own Qualcomm.
""Broadcom continues to pursue the redomiciliation process as expeditiously as possible,"" Broadcom said. ""Upon completion of the redomiciliation, Broadcom’s proposed acquisition of Qualcomm will not be a CFIUS covered transaction.""
Qualcomm, which has told shareholders it is open to the merger at the right price and terms, had said last week it had no intention of delaying the annual shareholder meeting. 
""Qualcomm now has their excuse to postpone their critical vote, giving them some breathing room to work on its acquisition of  NXP Semiconductors  NV (O:NXPI), attempt to make progress on their Apple Inc (O:AAPL) licensing issues, and attempt to build a stronger case for shareholders,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.
Qualcomm on Monday extended its $44 billion tender offer for NXP to March 9, as it awaits clearance from China's MOFCOM, the only regulator globally required to approve the deal that has yet to do so. 

Qualcomm is also in a legal battle with Apple over licensing and allegations that it has not delivered on promised rebates - seen by analysts as an effort by Apple to undermine Qualcomm's strong position in mobile chips.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares recovered on Monday from six-month lows hit last week on fears new U.S. tariffs would trigger trade wars, but were held back by heavy losses in Italy after anti-establishment parties surged in an inconclusive election. 
After an initial fall at the open, the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) switched back into positive territory and gained further strength as Wall Street reversed earlier losses. The STOXX closed up 1 percent at 370.87 points. 
Italy's FTSE MIB blue-chip index (FTMIB) fell 0.4 percent to November lows, dragged down notably by weakness among its banks. Italy faces a prolonged period of political instability after voters delivered a hung parliament.
""We expect lengthy negotiations after these elections, which may lead to increased volatility of Italian assets,"" said Matteo Ramenghi, CIO at UBS WM Italy.
Italy's parliament will meet for the first time on March 23 and President Sergio Mattarella is not expected to open formal talks on forming a government until early April.
Italian banks (FTIT8300), seen as a proxy for political risk given their large government bond holdings, were down 2.6 percent to a near two-month low 
Mid-sized Italian banks with domestically focused operations and high bad loan burdens were worst hit. BPER Banca (MI:EMII) lost 7.6 percent, Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) 6.1 percent and UBI Banca UBI.MI 3.7 percent.
European financials were also dragged down by France's AXA (PA:AXAF), which fell 9.7 percent. Europe's second-biggest insurer was the worst performer among blue chips, after it agreed to buy property and casualty insurance company XL Group for around $15 billion. 
 Mediaset  (MI:MS) fell 5.5 percent after the party of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose family controls the private broadcaster, did worse than expected. 
JCI Capital fund manager Alessandro Balsotti said even though the result of Italy's vote was not market-friendly, he did not expect systemic repercussions for European integration or the single currency, given that even the anti-establishment parties had toned down eurosceptic rhetoric during the campaign. 
The situation in Italy was in strong contrast to Germany where Social Democrats voted to re-enter a grand coalition with Chancellor Merkel’s conservatives, signaling an end to political uncertainty in Europe's biggest economy. 
Germay's DAX (GDAXI) index added 1.5 percent, a rise seen as a sign of confidence in Europe's economic recovery which helped confine worries about the Italian political situation. 
""The economic recovery in Europe and worldwide is much more resilient than in the past and the balance sheets of the companies are much stronger after many years of restructuring programmes,"" French asset manager Amundi said in a note. 

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened European automakers with a tax on imports if the European Union retaliated against his plan to slap tariffs on aluminum and steel. German automakers BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) were down 0.6 and 0.1 percent respectively.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's AXA (PA:AXAF) moved to buy Bermuda-based XL Group (N:XL) for $15.3 billion on Monday to create what it said would be a world leader in property and casualty insurance.
Europe's second-biggest insurer offered $57.60 for each XL share, a 33 percent premium to Friday's closing price, and said buying XL would result in property and casualty insurance rising to half of AXA's earnings, from 39 percent.
XL has already agreed to AXA's offer, and AXA, which ranks as Europe's second-biggest insurer in terms of market capitalization behind Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), will look to de-list XL's shares. AXA said it would finance the deal with debt, cash and the proceeds of the IPO of its U.S. business.
Insurers are turning to takeovers to strengthen their businesses as they face tougher regulation and falling returns from financial market investments. AXA's deal comes just over a month after American International Group (N:AIG) said it would buy reinsurer Validus (N:VR) for around $5.6 billion.
P&C insurers' stocks fell during last year's natural disaster season and have attracted the attention of bidders as premiums are rising after several years of falling rates.
Allianz had also been seen as a possible suitor for XL, but a source close to the German company said Allianz was not overly concerned by AXA scooping up XL. 
AXA's shares fell 6.9 percent to 23.33 euros by 0955 GMT, as some analysts said the deal looked pricey. Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said the deal will enable AXA to dominate the global property and casualty market, and reduce its exposure to the volatility of financial markets.
""We will be number one in commercial insurance,"" Buberl told a news conference in Paris.
Some analysts were skeptical about the price.
""In our view, the acquisition of XL fits AXA's strategy of growing in commercial insurance. However, the purchase price looks quite high even after synergy effects and AXA's debt ratio is again rather stretched,"" said analysts at German brokerage Bankhaus Lampe, who kept a ""hold"" rating on AXA shares.
Analysts at UBS said XL did not necessarily fit AXA's plans to grow in Asia, given XL's predominantly U.S.-exposed business.
""AXA targets growth in health, protection and commercial lines, P&C (property & casualty) markets preferably in Asia rather than U.S. reinsurance,"" UBS said.
""However, acquiring XL does give global commercial P&C lines exposure and further accelerate AXA's exit from more volatile business lines in the U.S.,"" it added.
COST SYNERGIES
AXA has not been hit as hard as some by a series of costly natural catastrophes in 2017, thanks to reinsurance contracts and a diversified business model, and last month it reported higher-than-expected 2017 net profits of 6.2 billion euros.
The company expects the XL takeover to be cash accretive, and result in cost synergies of around $400 million per year, based on pre-tax earnings.
Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Geneva-based Prime Partners which owns AXA shares, said it was a ""good deal"" given AXA's plans to cut its exposure to financial markets, and that it looked positive on a long-term view.
The French company also reaffirmed its 2020 financial targets, under which AXA aims to increase earnings per share by 3 to 7 percent a year over the 2016-2020 period.

Law firm Skadden said it was advising XL over the AXA takeover, while AXA added that JP Morgan was involved in part of the financing of the XL takeover.

370,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 06, 2018 02:30AM ET</span>",Noble Group Paid Co-CEO $20 Million as Company Lost Billions,"(Bloomberg) -- Noble Group Ltd. handed its outgoing co-Chief Executive Officer Jeff Frase a remuneration package worth about $20 million last year, even as the commodity trader slumped to a record loss of almost $5 billion.
The scale of the award, reported in Noble’s annual financial statements last week, is likely to provoke consternation as the embattled trading house attempts to secure agreement from its creditors and shareholders for a restructuring plan that would impose heavy losses.
The remuneration is more than the $15 million than Noble has offered to pay holders of its perpetual bonds, which have a face value of $400 million. Under the current debt restructuring plan, perpetual bondholders, which rank below other debt securities, will suffer a 96.25 percent loss in face value.
Frase, an oil trader who previously worked at JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)., Lehman Brothers and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS)., resigned as co-chief executive and head of global oil liquids of Noble in November, after the company agreed to sell its remaining oil trading business to Vitol Group. Earlier, Noble sold two other energy businesses to trader Mercuria Energy Group Ltd. and Calpine Corp.
His remuneration totaled $20.2 million dollars in 2017, according to Noble’s financial statements, of which $3.5 million was a “share-based payment expense” and $16.7 million described as “other emoluments.” That’s more than all the company’s directors put together were paid the previous year.
Guiding Force
Noble’s restructuring plan has come under fire from some investors for its proposal to hand a 20 percent stake in the revamped group to management. Goldilocks Investment Co., the fifth-largest shareholder, asked in a statement last week: “Why should this same management that had created Noble’s present debacle be rewarded, let alone so richly?”
The financial statements, disclosed last week, report compensation for the company’s executive directors, who are listed as Frase, current CEO Will Randall, Chairman Paul Brough, and founder Richard Elman. It further divides the data into remuneration of directors at continuing operations and remuneration of directors at discontinued operations -- a classification which applies only to Frase, whose oil trading business is reported as a discontinued operation throughout Noble’s accounts.

In a statement announcing his departure in November, the company said Frase had “decided to resign” to “focus on other opportunities,” and praised him as “the guiding force behind the expansion and profitability of the Group’s global oil liquids platform.”
The oil- and gas-trading businesses made a net loss of $1.05 billion last year as Noble wound down the unit.
A person familiar with the situation said that the $16.7 million in emoluments included retention payments to ensure management continuity as the oil business was sold, explaining that it was a requirement imposed by the company’s banks in order to continue lending through the sale process. It also included a termination payment, and writing off a $5 million loan from the company to Frase, the person said. A second person familiar with the matter said that while retention payments were paid in 2017, they related to performance in previous years, plus payments to settle tax bills. The second person also said part of the loan was repaid.
Brough, Randall and Elman together received total remuneration of about $15 million last year, according to the statements.
Noble Group’s shares have come under greater pressure since the $5 billion loss was confirmed last week. The stock tumbled as much as 7.1 percent to 14.5 Singapore cents on Monday, falling for an eighth day, and traded at 14.9 cents at 10:44 a.m., the lowest level since December.

The target was released Monday ahead of Premier Li Keqiang’s report to the National People’s Congress gathering in Beijing.

373,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2018 06:10PM ET</span>",Caterpillar drives sales on China's new Silk Road,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Brenda Goh
CHICAGO/NANTONG, China (Reuters) - At a  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) facility in the eastern Chinese city of Nantong, an array of excavators, earth movers and road-making machinery is displayed on slopes and in mud pits.
The audience is Caterpillar's local network of dealers, who inspect the machines for the latest technological innovations to help make their sales pitches to buyers in China. 
However, much of the heavy equipment could find its way to construction and mining projects in places like Pakistan or Kazakhstan, or as far away as Africa.
Caterpillar has been investing heavily in China – the Nantong facility is one of 25 similar ones it has set up across the country – in the hopes of cracking the largest construction and mining equipment market in the world.
Helping fuel the growth of that market, Caterpillar executives and analysts say, is China's Belt and Road initiative, a huge infrastructure spending spree that builds on the old Silk Road trading routes. The ambitious and ever-growing $1 trillion initiative now includes projects spanning Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
""Belt and Road is becoming a very important driver for Caterpillar's development,"" said Chen Qihua, head of Caterpillar China, at the Nantong facility.
The world's biggest equipment maker doesn't reveal its sales tied directly to Belt and Road projects, or break out its China revenues. 
But analysts say its Asia-Pacific sales figures reflect demand for machines destined for Belt and Road projects as contractors buy most of their equipment in China to take advantage of tax rebates handed out for the initiative. Chen said contractors prefer to buy machines in China to take advantage of the rebates.
Asia-Pacific sales increased 22 percent in the last quarter of 2017 over the previous year, with construction demand in China accounting for about half that increase, Caterpillar said in January. It said it expected demand to remain strong at least through the first half of 2018.
(Graphic on Caterpillar's sales: http://tmsnrt.rs/2ExfXqr) 
Once purchased in China, the equipment is shipped off to projects across the vast geography of the initiative and put to work building power plants in Pakistan, constructing highways in Belarus or developing new mines in Africa. Most of the equipment sent is made in China, Chen said.
Lawrence Poh, executive director at Caterpillar's largest dealer in China, told Reuters at his office in Kunshan, just outside Shanghai, that orders had increased due to demand from Belt and Road projects. He did not provide details. 
COMPETITION
While China has been a bright spot for Caterpillar, it is facing competition from cheaper construction equipment made by Chinese companies, particularly in China. Other Western companies such as  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), Honeywell and Maersk are also vying for orders, particularly in the energy and transportation segment.
Joshua Yau, a Hong Kong-based Belt and Road analyst at Strategy&, an arm of the PwC consultancy, says Chinese construction equipment companies like Zoomlion and Sany Heavy Industries dominate sales inside China.
But Yau said that outside China, Caterpillar's advanced technology and global network made it a better option.
""Caterpillar is mostly getting the orders where Chinese equipment suppliers are not competitive,"" said Yau. He added that Chinese products were generally viewed as inferior in terms of quality and technology.
Caterpillar's sales pitch is that its machines use less fuel and help construction teams work faster. Advanced software helps track the machines' performance, and when things go wrong it has a network of more than 170 dealers and 2,000 branches around the world to help with repairs.
""In the geographies where they are newcomers, Chinese contractors can leverage CAT's overseas network to help compete and win projects,"" Yau said.
In Africa, for instance, a piece of equipment sold by a China-based dealer for a project in Kenya or Algeria could be serviced by a Caterpillar dealer on the continent.
""It's very easy for us to align with other dealers,"" Poh said. ""Once our equipment goes abroad, they will need to provide good maintenance and upkeep for the customer in order to allow the equipment to perform at their best.""
Analysts said a lack of overseas dealer networks and a perceived shortfall in quality meant Chinese rivals were struggling to expand their share of the global market.
""The low-labour cost advantage associated with these Chinese companies will hold less sway as products become increasingly complex and quality standards significantly increase,"" analysts at Morningstar wrote in a recent note. 
Caterpillar is also deploying its financing arm to spur Belt and Road sales, company executives said. Since the launch of the initiative, the financing arm has started lending to Chinese companies, including state-owned enterprises, to help bridge their funding gaps. Caterpillar does not disclose specific data for such lending. 
MULTI-YEAR BOOST
Still, Belt and Road is also providing opportunities for Chinese construction companies.
A study by Off-Highway Research found that countries along the Belt and Road accounted for 30 percent of Sany's overall sales in 2016-2017. At XCMG Construction Machinery, 75 percent of overseas sales came from countries associated with the initiative. Sales figures were not provided.
Analysts and Caterpillar executives say Belt and Road, on which Beijing says it wants to spend as much as $150 billion a year outside China, offers ample opportunities for all manufacturers.

""As government funding for the BRI projects improves, this is expected to result in higher demand throughout the industry,"" said Jeff Hardee, director of Asia-Pacific government & corporate affairs at Caterpillar in Singapore, referring to the initiative.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares stumbled to near three-week lows on Monday amid fears of a global trade war, while the euro was unsteady in currency markets due to worries that an anti-establishment coalition government could emerge from elections in Italy.
Italian voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday, flocking to anti-establishment and far-right parties in record numbers and casting the euro zone's third-largest economy into a political gridlock that could take months to clear.
After a see-saw start, the common currency eased back to $1.2323 from a two-week high of $1.2365 as the euroskeptic 5-Star Movement saw its support soar to become the largest single party, according to projections based on early vote-counting.
""The messy Italian election result adds a bit to the nervousness to global equity markets at present,"" said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based chief economist at AMP. 
""The Italian election...does run the risk of making Italy's public finances worse than they already are with no progress in addressing Italy's long-term competitiveness problems."" 
The euro still found support after Germany's Social Democrat party decisively backed the renewal of an alliance with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, allowing her to form a new government more than five months since the country's inconclusive election.
The single currency also got a lift from safe-haven flows, as did the yen, with risk sentiment souring on fears of a trade war after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.
The dollar fell for a fourth straight session to trade around 105.49 yen, but was slightly above Friday's low of 105.23, a level not seen since November 2016. 
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was mostly unchanged.
""Nothing's happened over the weekend to soften concerns about trade wars or retaliatory actions by other countries,"" said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank. 
""There is no rowing back so that gets us to a cautious start.""
Canada and Mexico have threatened retaliation, and the European Union said it would apply 25 percent tariffs on about $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if Trump carried out his threat.
China said on Sunday it did not want a trade war with the United States but will defend its interests, warning that policies based on ""mistaken assumptions"" will damage bilateral relations. 
SOFT SHARES
Investors fear the current momentum in the global economy could be lost if Trump starts a trade war.
Asian markets were a sea of red with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan falling 0.8 percent to the lowest since mid-February. It lost more than 2 percent of its value last week.
Japan's Nikkei and South Korea's KOSPI both lost 0.7 percent, while Chinese shares eased too after starting on a positive note. 
U.S. stock futures did not inspire much confidence, with S&P E-Minis down 0.5 percent and Dow futures off 0.4 percent.
""Frustration with a lack of market access and a lack of fair trade are understandable,"" said Peter Jolly, global head of research for National Australia Bank.
""If this escalation draws that into focus with some improvement, that would be positive. But retaliatory tit-for-tat measures would weigh against market access, a cost to growth with increases in trade prices, costs, and inflation.""
Investors will focus on a deluge of data this week, culminating in the U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday. The annual opening of the National People's Congress in China was another focus for investors. China's parliament has kept the economy's growth target at 6.5 percent for this year.
In commodities, oil prices climbed ahead of a meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms in Houston, raising expectations that oil producers would discuss further how to clear a global glut.
Brent crude was up 30 cents at $64.67 a barrel while U.S. light crude added 47 cents to $61.64.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2018 02:20PM ET</span>",North American February semi-truck orders soar 76 percent: analyst,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - North American orders for Class 8 semi-trucks jumped more than 76 percent in February as trucking companies rushed to add capacity in a tight U.S. freight market, FTR, a company that tracks the industry, said on Sunday.
Preliminary orders in the United States, Canada and Mexico for the big rigs that haul freight along North American highways hit 40,200 trucks, up from 22,886 in February 2017, the second consecutive month that orders exceeded 40,000 units. 
""The capacity crunch is transforming into a capacity crisis and many fleets of all sizes, in all markets, across the country are scrambling to add trucks as fast as they can,"" Don Ake, FTR vice president of commercial vehicles, said in a statement. 
Many rail and truck freight customers are grappling with how to defend their profit margins as transportation costs climb at nearly double the inflation rate.
FTR said the ongoing crunch in U.S. freight capacity appears to be exacerbated by a federal mandate that truck firms switch to electronic logs (ELDs) from paper logs, which into effect in December. 
With few exceptions, vehicle operators have until April 1 to comply with the ELD mandate.
Experts have predicted many smaller trucking outfits that have fudged the books in order to stay profitable in a low-margin industry will close up shop, benefiting larger companies and driving up demand for new vehicles.
""It looks like fleets held back some orders from the fourth quarter to see if freight growth would continue and if ELDs were final,"" Ake said. ""Now that the environment is more certain, the orders have been pouring in.""
February orders were ""sturdy across the board for all markets and truck types,"" FTR said.  
Full-year 2017 orders for Class 8 trucks came in at 290,000 units compared with 164,000 in 2016. The United States is by far the largest market in North America.
The main truck makers in the U.S. market are  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn),  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV),  Paccar Inc  (O:PCAR) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).

More than a dozen people have been arrested by India’s Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) since the fraud at PNB, India’s second-biggest lender, came to light in January.
The CBI said on Sunday that it had arrested Manish Bosamiya and Miten Pandya, both former employees of Firestar International -- a company owned by billionaire jeweler Nirav Modi. 
Businesses owned by Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi have been accused of securing unauthorized loans using fraudulent letters of undertaking from PNB.
The former Firestar employees were arrested on suspicion of fabricating paperwork for the fraud, the CBI said.
An auditor, Sampat Rambhia, was also arrested, as was Aniyath Shiv Raman, a former director of M/s Gili India, who the CBI alleges authorized paperwork used in the fraud. Gili is owned by Choksi.
None of the latest individuals to be arrested were reachable for comment on Sunday.
The agency has yet to track down Modi and Choksi, who left India in January before the fraud came to light. Both have issued statements denying the CBI’s charges.

Modi and Choksi, owner of  Gitanjali Gems  (NS:GTGM), are suspected of colluding with bank officials at PNB to obtain unauthorized loans over a six-year period starting in 2011. Gitanjali has also denied CBI’s accusations.

Siemens announced plans to float Healthineers on the Frankfurt stock exchange two weeks ago, putting it on track for a listing in late March. 
In what would be one of Germany's biggest listings in recent years, Siemens plans to sell up to 15 percent of the division -- or a maximum of 150 million shares -- at a price range of between 26 euros and 31 euros per share, it said on Sunday. 
That would bring the parent proceeds of between 3.9 billion euros and 4.65 billion euros ($4.8 billion-$5.7 billion). 
The IPO had been expected to value the maker of medical imaging and diagnostics gear at about 35 billion euros.
Siemens is expected to publish the listing prospectus on Monday. 
Investment banks Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and JP Morgan (N:JPM) will act as joint global coordinators, helped by  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), BofA Merrill Lynch (N:BAC),  Citigroup  (N:C) and UBS (S:UBSG).

""Currently we have no plans for further purchases. We will concentrate for now on the development of existing holdings. There are many ideas, and there is much to do,"" weekly Bild am Sonntag quoted Li as saying in an interview published on Sunday.
Li has led a major acquisition push globally since 2010, when he took over Swedish car brand Volvo from  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) in a $1.8 billion deal.
Over the last year, he has snapped up a $3.3 billion stake in truck maker AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb), a majority stake in sports car maker Lotus, a 49.9 percent stake in Malaysian automaker Proton and flying car start-up Terrafugia. He already owns LEVC, the maker of London's iconic black cabs.
His purchase of a $9 billion stake in Daimler, unveiled last week, surprised the market and rekindled fears in Germany of its highly prized industrial expertise falling into Chinese hands.
When asked by Bild am Sonntag about those concerns, Li said that his focus was on future technology.
""For me, it's not about available technology but what is coming in the future. Or to put it another way, I would like a slice of a cake that is bigger than the cake of today,"" he said.
When asked if Geely and Daimler could work together on electric cars, Li said he was keen to cooperate on various areas.
He also said that he had no plans to make changes to Daimler's cooperation with other Chinese partners, such as BAIC or BYD, and that all parties could benefit from sharing of ideas.
According to multiple sources and documents reviewed by Reuters, Li used Hong Kong shell companies, derivatives, bank financing and carefully structured share options to become Daimler's single largest shareholder.
Asked by Bild am Sonntag how he financed the purchase, he said some of the money was his own and some was financed via foreign banks, without providing details.
He said none of the funding came from the Chinese government and that he did not seek the approval of the government before buying the stake.

""We have never asked the Chinese government for its approval of an investment ahead of time. The same goes for our Daimler stake,"" he said.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2018 01:15PM ET</span>","As its wealth fund goes green, Norway's firms struggle to keep up","By Alister Doyle Environment Correspondent
OSLO (Reuters) - Many Norwegian companies lag high standards for reporting their impact on the environment that the Nordic nation's $1 trillion wealth fund is championing abroad in 2018.
The world's biggest sovereign wealth fund, which is barred by the Norwegian government from investing at home, wants the 9,100 companies in which it holds stakes to submit data on issues such as water use and climate effects to London-based non-profit group CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project.
In Norway, just two firms - DNB (OL:DNB) bank and property firm Entra (OL:ENTRA) - were on a CDP list of 160 ""A"" rated performers worldwide for disclosure in 2017. That was comparable to other Nordic nations but not exemplary, CDP data show.
Norway's state-controlled oil group  Statoil  (OL:STL) got an ""F"" grade for disclosure of fresh water use - a core focus area for the fund abroad - after it declined to take part in the CDP survey. 
On climate change reporting, including tracking greenhouse gas emissions, Statoil got a strong ""A-"".
""It's not our responsibility"" to ensure that Norwegian firms comply, central bank governor Oeystein Olsen told Reuters when asked if Oslo was pressing higher standards abroad than at home. The wealth fund is managed by a unit of the central bank.
CDP said there were no Norwegian firms, for instance, among almost 100 companies including L'Oreal (PA:OREP), Walmart (N:WMT) and Toyota (T:6201) rated as leaders in tracking greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chains.
""If Norwegian companies want to take a leadership role on climate change they should be engaging with their suppliers on these issues,"" said Sonya Bhonsle, head of supply chain at CDP.
Norway's fund, built from the nation's oil and gas revenues, says global warming is stoking downpours, droughts and rising sea levels that threaten long-term earnings. It says investors need harmonized data to compare risks.
Its policies, such as restricting investments in coal companies, have huge influence for companies and investors because it owns on average 1.4 percent of all listed shares worldwide. 
Yngve Slyngstad, the fund's CEO, said it encouraged companies abroad to ""strengthen their reporting in general, directly to the investors, but also indirectly through the CDP"". Few companies are doing enough on climate change, he said.
SEA WATER
Statoil spokesman Erik Haaland said the company did not take part in the CDP fresh water survey because most of the firm's operations are offshore, using abundant sea water. Statoil has water-intensive shale oil and gas in the United States.
""Also, the questionnaire is quite extensive, and since the issue is less material for our operations we made the decision to not take part,"" he said. 
Asked if the government had a double standard, Norway's deputy Finance Minister Geir Olsen wrote in an e-mail that the ministry ""welcomes efforts to standardize climate reporting according to internationally agreed principles.""
The finance ministry oversees the sovereign wealth fund.
Martin Skancke, a consultant on the design of sovereign wealth funds, said ""obviously there is a reasonable expectation that when the government promotes these standards through the fund in foreign markets that it also promotes them internally"".
He said that, from his own experience on boards of Norwegian companies, the center-right government does urge companies to disclose environmental data. He said it was hard to estimate the extra costs of such reporting.
Among other Norwegian companies, state-controlled telecoms group  Telenor  (OL:TEL) got an ""A-"" for climate change reporting in 2017, while aluminum producer Hydro (OL:NHY) and fertilizer-maker Yara International (OL:YAR), in which the state owns just over a third, got ""C""s.
Hydro said it had reported to the CDP since 2004 but lost marks on technicalities.
""When filling in the CDP questionnaire, we are more occupied about reporting quality information requested by important stakeholders, than exactly following the CDP format,"" it said in an e-mail.
Yara spokeswoman Kristin Nordal said the company halved its greenhouse gas emissions between 2004 and 2013.
""We will certainly not claim to have all the answers in place on issues such as climate and water, and we are presently going through a strategic process to further improve our response to sustainability matters,"" she said.
Abroad, the companies in which the fund has the biggest holdings - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Nestle (S:NESN) - both got ""A"" grades from CDP for climate change reporting.

On fresh water use, most big foreign energy companies joined Statoil in declining to take part in the CDP water survey. Exceptions included  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Neste Oy (HE:NESTE).

Yang Weimin, the deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Financial and Economic Affairs, said the ""extremely arduous"" task was necessary to head off the financial risks in the Chinese economy that were becoming ""progressively visible"", according to the Securities Times business newspaper.
""Firstly, the overall money supply must be controlled, and the printing of money cannot be excessive,"" the Securities Times quoted Yang as saying on the sidelines of an annual meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Communist Party's largely ceremonial advisory body to parliament. ""Furthermore, there should be stronger oversight rather than the relaxation of financial oversight.""
Among a raft of major issues that needed to be tackled to combat financial risk were the continued reduction of overcapacity and 'zombie companies', controlling debt levels and keeping property markets stable, Yang said. 
Beijing's willingness to curtail big-spending conglomerates as it cracks down on financial risk was dramatically demonstrated in the past fortnight, when the government took control of Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd  and prosecuted its chairman.
The South China Morning Post reported on Friday that a Shanghai government agency has taken control of CEFC China Energy, the private firm that has agreed to buy a $9.1 billion stake in Russian oil major Rosneft (MM:ROSN). CEFC denied the report and said it was running its operations as normal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge late Friday dismissed a lawsuit filed by institutional investors who purchased bonds from Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) U.S. unit and claimed the automaker had made false and misleading statements before its massive diesel emissions scandal became public.
Investors bought $8.3 billion in dollar-denominated bonds Volkswagen Group of America Finance LLC sold in 2014 and 2015. A group of those investors sued the company after it admitted in September 2015 to secretly installing software to evade emissions rules for at least six years that led to the ouster of its chief executive, damaged the company’s reputation and prompted massive bills.
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco dismissed the class-action suit against VW, its U.S. unit and former chief executive Martin Winterkorn. Breyer had ruled in July the case could go forward but reconsidered his decision after VW lawyers raised a new ruling by a federal appeals court in a case involving  Barclays  (LON:BARC).
The investors alleged damages into the hundreds of millions of dollars after the bonds' value dropped. Breyer gave the investors 30 days to file an amended complaint, but he said they will face a ""heavy burden"" to demonstrate they meet legal requirements.
The lead plaintiff in the action is the Puerto Rico Government Employees and Judiciary Retirement Systems Administration.
Volkswagen spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said Saturday the company ""welcomes the court’s decision to dismiss the entire action as fundamentally flawed.""
In total, VW has agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles.
VW faces other suits.
Investors from around the world are seeking 9 billion euros ($11 billion) in damages from Volkswagen, which they say did not inform shareholders quickly enough over its use of illegal software to cheat U.S. tests on diesel engine emissions.
About 1,600 lawsuits have been lodged at a regional court in Braunschweig near VW’s Wolfsburg headquarters, seeking damages over the sharp fall in VW shares that followed its emissions admission.
Earlier this week, Volkswagen told the German court it had no duty to disclose the possible financial damage of its manipulations prior to September 2015, when it issued an ad-hoc statement that the illegal software could be in around 11 million cars worldwide.
Led by investment management firm Deka, the plaintiff’s side includes another 2,000 individuals who have raised claims without suing VW, Reuters reported earlier this week.
Public hearings of the case at the Braunschweig court are due to start in early September.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Two pension funds that are the largest shareholders in Brazilian food processor BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) presented on Saturday a list of ten candidates for seats to the company's board that excludes the current chairman, according to a joint statement.
Pension funds Previ and Petros, which represent employees of state-controlled companies Banco do Brasil SA and Petroleo Brasileiro SA and hold a joint 22 percent stake in the food processor, a major producer of pork and chicken products. 
The funds are proposing Augusto da Cruz Filho as BRF's new chairman, replacing retail tycoon Abilio Diniz.
The overhaul in BRF's board and management was requested by the funds after the company last year reported its worst results ever, posting a 1.2 billion reais ($371 million) loss.
Among the 10 candidates supported by the funds is Luiz Fernando Furlan, a former Brazil's Development and Foreign Trade minister which is a member of one of the families that founded Sadia, one of the two companies in the merger that created BRF SA almost ten years ago. 
There is no candidate on the list representing investment firm Tarpon Investimentos SA (SA:TRPN3), an ally of Diniz which holds a 7.3 percent stake in BRF.

The study, by the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, found that drivers' median pretax profit was $3.37 per hour, using results from a survey of more than 1,100 workers of the ride hailing companies. 
Uber and Lyft have been battling complaints that they underpay their drivers. Uber and other companies have defended their business models saying their drivers enjoy the flexibility of their work and on average earn more than the minimum wage, but have lost a series of court cases on the issue.
Khosrowshahi criticized the MIT study in a tweet on Friday as ""Mathematically Incompetent Theories (at least as it pertains to ride-sharing),"" and linked to a response by Uber chief economist Jonathan Hall that challenged the study's methodology. 
Hall's rebuttal to the study said the likely misinterpretation of a survey question and the study's ""inconsistent logic"" produced a wage result that was below similar studies elsewhere. He said the study used a ""flawed methodology"" compared with a survey that found drivers' average hour earnings were $15.68.
""The earnings figures suggested in the paper are less than half the hourly earnings numbers reported in the very survey the paper derives its data from,"" wrote Hall. 
The MIT study's lead author, Stephen Zoepf, told Reuters in an email on Saturday, ""I can see how the question on revenue might have been interpreted differently by respondents"" and called Hall's rebuttal thoughtful. 

""I'm re-running the analysis this weekend using Uber's more optimistic assumptions and should have new results and a public response acknowledging the discrepancy by Monday,"" he wrote.

The United States imposes a 2.5-percent tariff on cars assembled in Europe and a 25-percent tariff on European-built vans and pickup trucks. Europe imposes a 10-percent tariff on U.S.-built cars.
Trump criticized Europe in remarks at a fundraiser, according to video posted online Saturday, and suggested they would not increase tariffs.
""The European Union: brutal. They've been brutal to us,"" Trump said at a Florida fundraiser. ""They've banded together in order to beat the United States in trade.""
Trump did not respond to questions about tariffs or other topics upon returning to the White House Saturday.
In a speech Friday night at Harvard University, European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager said the EU will respond to the tariffs ""to defend European industry, and the world trading system,"" according to a copy of her remarks. She called the Trump action ""one-sided protectionist measures, which hurt, not just jobs, but the whole system of rules that makes our global economy work.""
German automakers Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) AG,  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and BMW AG build vehicles at plants in the United States. BMW employs more than 9,000 workers in South Carolina and is one of the state's largest employers.
The United States accounts for about 15 percent of worldwide Mercedes-Benz and BMW brand sales, while it accounts for 5 percent of VW brand sales and 12 percent of Audi sales.
The United States had a $22.3 billion automotive vehicle and parts trade deficit with Germany in 2017 and a $7 billion deficit with the United Kingdom, according to U.S. government data.
Last year, Germany's automotive trade association said ""the United States would be shooting itself in the foot by imposing tariffs or other trade barriers.""
Trump's threat comes amid mounting transatlantic tension on trade.
On Thursday, Trump said the United States would apply duties of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum to protect domestic producers.
Major automakers say the move will hike the cost of cars and trucks.
The next day, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told German television that ""We will put tariffs on Harley-Davidson (motorcycles), on bourbon and on blue jeans - Levis.""
Canada also has said it will retaliate for any tariffs on steel and aluminum.
Trump had tweeted on Friday that trade wars are good and ""easy to win,"" roiling U.S. financial markets.

In January 2017, Trump warned German car companies he would impose a border tax of 35 percent on vehicles imported to the U.S. market.

391,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>","As NAFTA weighs, Trump's tariffs drive new U.S. auto concerns","By Lesley Wroughton
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - From a hotel in Mexico City, Ann Wilson, a senior executive at the U.S. Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association (MEMA), is fielding calls from American auto parts makers worried that President Donald Trump's metal tariffs will force them out of business.
Wilson came to Mexico with a different task - to lobby NAFTA trade negotiators on behalf of the U.S. auto industry, but once Trump announced on Thursday that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum products, her phone began ringing with calls from members at home. 
""Everybody is very concerned,"" Wilson told Reuters on Friday. ""We've seen it in the stock market and level of CEO calls I've been getting over the last 24 hours how much this is a concern and how much of this overrides everything else.""
The U.S. auto parts industry employs about 880,000 workers and MEMA represents motor vehicle parts manufacturers, the largest U.S. manufacturing sector and largest employer of manufacturing jobs in the United States.
Some of MEMA's members would be deeply affected by Trump's tariffs because they rely on specialty steel and aluminum products imported from Europe, Asia and other regions, said Wilson, speaking on the sidelines of the North American Free Trade Agreement talks. 
Many economists say that instead of increasing employment, price increases for consumers of steel and aluminum such as the auto and oil industries will destroy more U.S. jobs than they create.
""Our industry was really pleased with what we accomplished with tax reform and the improvement in the economy, and a lot of that enthusiasm could all be for naught if we do something like this,"" said Wilson.
The parts companies, some of them the largest employers in a local district, worry that if Trump goes ahead with the tariffs they may not be able to adjust quickly enough and be forced out of business by the substantially higher cost of imports. Foreign suppliers may also begin to look outside the United States for other customers.
""The smaller suppliers are the ones at risk because they can't pivot and they can't move their businesses,"" said Wilson. ""They may not be able to absorb this kind of cost. It's not as simple as saying we'll just make that specialty steel here.""
Some of the products that are imported are as specialized as steel tire cords used to reinforce tires, or cylinders used for auto fuel injectors.
Washington-based MEMA has actively lobbied the administration and Congress about the hazards of imposing tariffs and pushed back at arguments that imports of the metals were a security risk.
In mid-February, MEMA wrote to Trump opposing any action saying it was necessary for auto supply companies to have access to specialty steel and aluminum products so they can keep manufacturing parts in the United States.

Even if Trump agrees to exempt some products from the tariffs, Wilson said companies, especially smaller ones, worry they will be burdened by red tape related to applying for exclusions.

393,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>","Porsche could build flying taxis, says sales chief","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) sports car maker Porsche could develop a flying passenger vehicle to compete with rivals in a possible market for urban air taxis and ride-sharing services, Porsche sales chief Detlev von Platen told a German magazine.
""That would really make sense. If I drive from (the Porsche plant in) Zuffenhausen to Stuttgart airport, I need at least half an hour, if I'm lucky. Flying would take only three and a half minutes,"" Automobilwoche quoted von Platen as saying.
Porsche would join a raft of companies working on designs for flying cars in anticipation of a shift in the transport market away from conventional cars to self-driving vehicles shared via ride-hailing apps.
Volkswagen's auto designer Italdesign and Airbus (PA:AIR) at last year's Geneva auto show presented a two-seater flying car, called Pop.Up, designed to avoid gridlock on city roads.
The magazine said that under Porsche's plans, passengers would be able to have some control over the flying vehicle themselves but would not need a pilot license because many of the car's functions would be automated.

Potential competitors to a flying vehicle made by Porsche would be German start-ups Volocopter, backed by  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), Lilium Jet and eVolo, as well as U.S.-based Terrafugia and California-based Joby Aviation.

394,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2018 05:30AM ET</span>",U.S. prosecutors want stay lifted to settle 'The Wolf of Wall Street' suit,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has asked a court to lift a stay on civil proceedings linked to a Malaysian fund at the center of its biggest ever ""kleptocracy"" probe, so that a settlement can be reached with producers of the movie 'The Wolf of Wall Street'.
In September, U.S. prosecutors were granted a stay on dozens of civil lawsuits they filed in connection with $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with or funded by money stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), to make way for a criminal probe into the scandal-hit state fund.
The court filing on Friday requesting the lifting of the stay order did not say whether prosecutors would now go ahead with a criminal probe. If they did, the timing could be awkward for Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who founded 1MDB, as he prepares to call an election that must be held by August.
The court filing said the prosecutors sought to lift the stay order to make way for a ""consent judgment and proposed consent judgment that will fully resolve this case"".
Red Granite Pictures, which produced 'The Wolf of Wall Street' and was co-founded by Najib's step son, had announced in September that it had ""reached a settlement in principle"" with the U.S. government, without revealing any sum.
The Hollywood blockbuster, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was among the assets listed in the U.S. Justice Department's lawsuits.
The filing also said the parties involved have reached a global settlement that includes rights and interests in the motion pictures “Daddy’s Home” and “Dumb and Dumber To”.
Red Granite and 1MDB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to U.S. lawsuits filed in the past three years under the Justice Department's kleptocracy asset recovery initiative.
They include a private jet, a hotel and real estate in New York, and a $107 million interest in EMI Music Publishing purchased by Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, the department said.
The U.S. attorney-general described the 1MDB scandal as ""kleptocracy at its worst"".
The lawsuits also said $681 million from 1MDB was transferred to the account of “Malaysian Official 1”, which U.S. and Malaysian sources have previously identified as Najib.
Najib's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Najib set up 1MDB in 2009 and previously served as chairman of its advisory board. He and the fund have denied any wrongdoing.
At least six countries are investigating transactions related to 1MDB, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore.

In the past week, Indonesian authorities seized a luxury yacht, the Equanimity, which was sought by U.S. prosecutors as part of their investigations linked to 1MDB.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steelmaker, has not changed its plan to invest $1 billion dollars in a new production line in Mexico, a spokesman said on Friday, despite uncertainty around terms of trade in North America. 
Since ArecelorMittal announced the investment in September, talks initiated by U.S. President Donald Trump to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement have bogged down, and Trump stirred fears of a global trade war on Thursday by announcing plans for steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Mexico's steel chamber has called for immediate ""equivalent and reciprocal tariffs on steel imports from the United States"" if Trump follows through on his tariff plan next week as promised. 
ArcelorMittal's spokesman in Mexico said 80 percent of the steel the company produced in the country was destined for the local market, with the remaining 20 percent exported to the United States, Canada and other markets.
""In this context, we will keep working in the same way,"" said Ricardo Bussey, the corporate affairs director for ArcelorMittal Mexico, adding that the investment would take place over three years. 
The investment covers construction of a new hot strip mill, which upon completion in about three years will allow annual production of 2.5 million tonnes of flat rolled steel, the company said in September. 
The new production will be for domestic, non-auto, general industry customers, the company said.
ArcelorMittal operates six facilities at three ports in Mexico.
The company's main Mexican plant is in the west coast port city of Lazaro Cardenas. Bussey said he expected production this year would rise to 4.2 million tonnes from 3.8 million tonnes last year.
Mexico is a key production platform for the company. During the first half of 2017 ArcelorMittal produced nearly $12 billion of steel in North America while shipping about $11 billion from the three-country region linked by the 1994 NAFTA accord.
Mexican steelmaker Ternium also announced plans to build a new Mexican facility in September, with an investment of $1.1 billion. On Friday, Ternium said it could not immediately comment on its future plans. 

ArcelorMittal said in a statement earlier on Friday that it was assessing the potential global impact of planned U.S. tariffs on steel imports, while saying governments were right to take a tough approach to unfair trade.

397,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 06:39PM ET</span>",Broadcom return to the U.S. could be complete in mid-May: sources,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd, which is seeking to buy rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, plans to complete its move back to the United States by mid-May, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Wrapping up the move from Singapore and redomiciling in the United States relatively quickly could remove a roadblock to the proposed deal by calming concerns at the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which has the power to stop deals that could harm national security.
Broadcom said in November that it would return to the United States but did not say when the move would happen.
Broadcom shareholders will vote on the proposal by May 6, after which it must be confirmed by a judge. Once that happens, which is expected in early to mid-May, the redomiciling can happen quickly, according to a source familiar with the matter.
The entire process is likely to be wrapped up as soon as mid-May, the source added.
Broadcom was a U.S. company until it was bought in 2016 by Singapore's Avago, which decided to use the name Broadcom. 
Despite Broadcom's plans to move back to the United States, CFIUS has already shown an interest in the proposed transaction because Broadcom has proposed six directors for Qualcomm's 11-member board. The vote on that slate is set for Tuesday.
Broadcom has argued that CFIUS' concern is unwarranted since it does not control the directors that it proposed.
""Broadcom could not and will not control the Qualcomm board - the essential basis for CFIUS jurisdiction - in the event some or all of the independent, Broadcom-nominated directors are elected,"" the company said in a statement on Friday.
It also reiterated it was confident it would be able to win regulatory approval for a deal to buy Qualcomm within approximately 12 months of reaching an agreement.
Qualcomm has argued that Broadcom's $117 billion offer undervalues the company. Broadcom has accused Qualcomm of failing to negotiate seriously, saying they were involved in ""engagement theater.""

398,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 05:03PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week.
1. Trade War Mania Grips Wall Street as Traders Flee Risky Assets 
At the onset of the week, much of investor focused was expected to be centred around one man: Jerome Powell, or “Jay”, Chairman of the Federal Reserve. Jay’s testimony Tuesday, in front of the House Financial Services Committee, drew a sharp reaction in US stocks– but just not the one expected.
Powell adopted a far more hawkish view than many had anticipated, expressing optimism on the pace of inflation as well as economic growth, while directing a subtle nod Trump’s way as he said: “fiscal policy has become more stimulative.”
That sent traders scrambling as they readjusted their outlook to four rate hikes from three total rate hikes this year, sending yields soaring, and U.S. stock markets nursing heavy losses.
Powell was back in spotlight Thursday, this time in front of the Senate Banking Committee, but chose more measured language, admitting that he sees “no evidence of the economy overheating.”
US stocks, however, were into selloff mode, as President Donald Trump’s proposal to impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% tariff on aluminium, stoked investor fears that the U.S.’s main trading partners would hit back, raising the prospect of a global trade war.
It wasn’t long until those fears were realized somewhat as Reuters reported Friday that the EU is considering setting duties on about $3.5 billion of U.S. imports on iconic U.S. brands such as Harley Davidson, Bourbon, Blue Jeans.
Despite reversing Friday’s losses, the Nasdaq fell to weekly loss for the first time in three weeks.
2. WTI Crude Snapped 2-Week Winning Streak
Crude oil prices snapped a two-week winning streak despite settling higher on Friday, as the number of oil rigs rose to their highest in nearly three years adding to fears of a prolonged ramp up in US oil output.
Oil prices may have settled higher on Friday, but traders harbor little hope of a sustained rebound as sentiment on oil prices remain negative after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) released data Wednesday showed U.S. crude stockpiles continued to build for the second-straight week.
U.S. production, meanwhile, rose to 10.3 million barrels per day, according to the EIA, as U.S. shale producers continued to take advantage of higher oil prices.
On Friday U.S. crude futures rose 26 cents to settle at $63.25 a barrel.
3. Euro Notched Weekly Gain; Kuroda Delivered Knockout Blow to Yen Bears
EUR/USD ended the week positive, underpinned by a sharp selloff in the dollar as the rising prospect of a global trade war halting U.S. economic growth weighed on the greenback.
Yet, sentiment on the euro is far from bullish ahead of two potentially major risk events: The result of a ballot of Social Democrat (SPD) party members on a coalition deal with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, and the outcome of the Italian election on Sunday.
USD/JPY ended the week nursing heavy losses as Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank would consider exiting from ultra-loose monetary policy measures by 2019 amid high probability that inflation would hit the central bank's target.
4. Gold Prices Slump To Second Weekly Loss
Despite a sharp rise Friday, gold prices ended the week in negative for a second-straight week as gains on rising safe-haven demand amid trade war fears failed to offset losses earlier during the week. 
The growing prospect of a faster pace of rate hikes continued to weigh on sentiment, forcing traders to unwind some of their bullish bets on the precious metal. CFTC COT data showed money managers cut their long bets on gold in the week ended March 2.
5. Bitcoin: This Time It’s Different
Bitcoin flirted with the $11,000 price level for much of the week, and was met with fierce resistance at each attempt to make sustained move above this price level. 
Some cited the prospect of a regulatory crackdown from Bank of England muddying bullish sentiment somewhat as Mark Carney warned that the time had come to “regulate elements of the crypto-asset ecosystem to combat illicit activities.”
Others, however, said the reason bitcoin struggled to mount a sustainable move higher is because price levels between $11,000 and $12,000 continued to act as technical resistance – trading levels that trigger selling.
The technical reason appeared to support some of the moves witnessed this week as bitcoin stumbled around the $11,000 price level for most of the week.
The leg up this week comes on seemingly scant demand as the total cryptomarket cap at $457 billion – at the time of writing – remained well below $510 billion seen last week, when bitcoin rallied to a more than three-week high of $11,766 on the bitfinex exchange.
Bitcoin rose 1.89% to $11,045 on Friday as traders monitored whether the popular digital currency would be able to build on its latest move above $11,000."

409,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>","Start of trial on AT&T, Time Warner merger may be delayed by one day","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The start date for the trial over whether wireless and pay TV provider AT&T Inc (N:T) can buy Time Warner Inc (N:T) may be delayed by a day to March 20, Judge Richard Leon said on Friday.
Leon, who is on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said March 19 may be needed to hear final pre-trial motions so the trial start may be pushed back.
The Justice Department's Craig Conrath said he opposed any delay because witnesses traveling to Washington for the trial could be inconvenienced.
No final decision on any delay was made.
The Justice Department sued in November to try and stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, arguing the deal would mean higher prices for rival cable and online video distributors and for consumers.

The $85 billion deal has been followed more closely than most antitrust matters because U.S. President Donald Trump attacked it while a candidate in 2016. Trump has also criticized Time Warner's CNN news network and, in November, he reiterated his opposition to the proposed transaction.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former security guard for an H.J. Heinz Co director must face civil insider trading charges arising from the ketchup maker's 2013 takeover by Brazil's 3G Capital and Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), a federal judge said on Friday.
U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan rejected Todd Alpert's request to dismiss a lawsuit filed last March by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC had accused Alpert of making $43,873 by illegally trading Heinz stock and options, after the resident of Kingston, Pennsylvania learned of the proposed $23 billion Heinz takeover though his job as a dispatcher for the longtime director.
While the director was not identified in the complaint, Heinz's board had since 2006 included Nelson Peltz, the activist investor, and public records show a shared historical address for Peltz and Alpert in a northern New York City suburb. Peltz was not accused of wrongdoing.
In court papers, Alpert's lawyer Robert Knuts argued that the defendant had been employed by a security company, not by the director himself, and owed the director no duty of confidence.
But the judge said Alpert's employment contract barred him from misusing confidences, while his alleged use of a Jan. 24, 2013 email marked ""confidential"" that contained the eventual takeover price may show he knew his trading was wrong.
She also noted that the director promptly fired Alpert in July 2015, nearly 2-1/2 years after the takeover was announced, upon learning of the suspicious trading.
""Defendant allegedly traded on confidential information for his own benefit, and did not disclose the trading activity to the board member for more than two years,"" Swain wrote. ""His alleged undisclosed, self-serving trading on the basis of misappropriated information constitutes the relevant fraud.""
Knuts, in an interview, said: ""It is disappointing that the court did not recognize the difference between a contractual relationship and a fiduciary relationship. Mr. Alpert may have made a mistake, but did not engage in intentional fraud.""
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Berkshire and 3G merged Heinz in 2015 with Kraft Foods Group Inc to form Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC), in which they own a roughly 51 percent stake.
The case is SEC v Alpert, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-01879.

BERLIN (Reuters) - European countries should look at the broader economic benefits of increased Gulf travel rather than focusing on the fate of national airlines, a senior UAE official said ahead of open skies negotiations with the European Union.
Some national carriers like Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) are concerned about losing business to Gulf rivals under a deal, which would govern traffic rights, as well as issues such as safety, security, and environmental cooperation.
The UAE hoped to reach agreement with the EU on an open skies agreement, Ali al-Ahmed, its envoy to Germany told reporters, adding that it had also asked for permission to add Berlin and Stuttgart to the four German cities it already serves - Hamburg, Duesseldorf, Munich and Frankfurt.
The EU already has open skies agreements with the United States, Canada, Israel and others. Its negotiations with Qatar have been underway for 18 months and are moving forward.
The economic bloc also has a mandate to negotiate with UAE, but is waiting for it to clarify certain matters before formally launching negotiations, an EU source said.
""It is short-sighted not to look at the big picture, the impact on hotels, restaurants, culture,"" the former senior telecommunications executive said. ""For national carriers to come and say, this is not a fair competition, that is really not looking at the greater good for the economy.""
Emirates Airline [EMIRA.UL] was by far the biggest buyer of Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 airplanes, which secured jobs in Hamburg and elsewhere, and had helped stave off a halt in A380 production, al-Ahmed said, adding that travelers from the Gulf also accounted for a large number of tourists in Bavaria.
He urged hotels, tourist businesses and others to help advocate for increased Gulf traffic into and out of Europe as it made no sense to sacrifice the broader economic gains just to protect national carriers, he said.
""At the end of the day, it is about customer's experience and they should be able to decide who do they want to fly with.""

427,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>","Semiconductors, Tech Stocks May Be at Risk If Trade War Broadens","(Bloomberg) -- Investors in technology shares are concerned that the industry could be the next victim of the Trump administration’s increasingly combative stance toward global trade partners.
While Donald Trump’s broadsides this week against what he deemed unfair trade practices focused on industrial metals, comments he made over the past couple of months about the tech industry indicate it could soon come in for targeting as well. In January, Trump said the U.S. was considering a fine on China because it had forced U.S. companies to share their intellectual property as a cost of doing business there. Then in his first State of the Union address, Trump pledged “strong enforcement” of U.S. rules that protect business secrets.
Those warnings are now sounding more ominous to investors concerned about a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.
Chris Krueger, an analyst at Cowen Washington Research, notes that semiconductors are one of six “core industries” in Trump’s America First agenda, along with steel, aluminum, vehicles, aircraft and shipbuilding. He said a U.S. Trade Representative report on forced technology transfers by China may come in a matter of weeks, way before the official Aug. 18 deadline, and could recommend tariffs or bans on Chinese investment or joint ventures.
If Trump does decide to crack down on intellectual property theft, U.S.-based semiconductor companies that have Chinese customers or factories in China could get caught in the crossfire. China is the largest market for the chip industry and if it were to retaliate some U.S. companies may suffer.
“Reciprocity on the part of China in IP crackdowns could have a substantial effect on manufacturing and IP of companies,” said Matt Larson, a Bloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst.
One sector high-flier with significant China exposure, Nvidia Corp., had been up 25 percent year-to-date. It sold off as much as 5.7 percent yesterday after Trump made his steel tariff comments, and is dropped as far as 4.5 percent today before recovering. The move over the past two days is worse than the broader market selloff of about 2 percent, reflecting the concern about a Trump tech crackdown.
Other chip stocks with significant China exposure include Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc., Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).,  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is reviewing its relationships with all ""politically divisive"" groups, the carrier's chief executive said in a Friday memo to employees, following blowback this week from the airline's decision to cut ties with the National Rifle Association.
In a memo to employees posted to its website, Delta addressed the weeklong uproar surrounding its decision last week to no longer offer a travel discount to NRA members after a Feb. 14 massacre of 17 students and educators at a Florida high school reignited the nation's long-running debate on gun ownership laws.
""Our discounted travel benefit for NRA members could be seen as Delta implicitly endorsing the NRA. That is not the case,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian wrote in the memo to employees. 
""We are in the process of a review to end group discounts for any group of a politically divisive nature.""
Since announcing its decision to cease its relationship with the NRA, Delta has faced calls for a boycott from members of the powerful gun rights group. 
Republican state officials in Georgia on Thursday punitively struck down a proposed jet fuel tax exemption that would have saved Delta, the state's largest private employer, some $40 million per year, despite public support for the proposal from the state's Republican governor, Nathan Deal. 
Only 13 people ever had taken advantage of the defunct discount program, according to Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter. Under the estimated savings of the failed tax provision, that boils down to more than $3 million per discount user.
""While Delta's intent was to remain neutral, some elected officials in Georgia tied our decision to a pending jet fuel tax exemption, threatening to eliminate it unless we reversed course,"" Bastian said in the memo. ""Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale.""
The state's lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, who is running to succeed Deal in the 2018 gubernatorial race, has threatened to ""kill any tax legislation"" that benefits Delta, prompting offers from several states to re-house the carrier's headquarters.

Bastian said in the memo that the carrier is proud to be headquartered in Georgia, where the airline employs 33,000 people statewide.

444,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 05:22PM ET</span>",BlackRock poses tough questions to gunmakers and sellers,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Asset manager BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) said on Friday it is pressing gunmakers and weapons retailers in its portfolios to explain how they monitor firearm sales and use, and it is studying the creation of new index-based portfolios of stocks that would exclude gunmakers and retailers.
The moves by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager with more than $6 trillion under management, amount to the most detailed critical stance by a big financial firm after last month's deadly high school shooting in Florida.
""As it has for many people, the recent tragedy in Florida has driven home for BlackRock the terrible toll from gun violence in America. We believe that this event requires response and action from a wide range of entities across both the public and private sectors,"" BlackRock said in a note to clients posted on its website.
Were it to launch the new portfolios, the step in theory might reduce demand for industry stocks given the firm's leading stakes in companies like American Outdoor Brands Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co..
Representatives for the companies have not responded to questions about shareholder pressure this week and did not immediately respond to inquiries on Friday.
The financial sector has been under pressure from clients and safety activists to re-examine relations with the weapons industry after the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 dead.
In its client note, BlackRock said its questions to gunmakers would include whether they require retailers to certify they do background checks and whether they require distributors to disclose regulatory warnings.
BlackRock also said it will ask gunmakers whether they monitor if their distributors and retailers ""have a high volume of their guns identified as having been used in crimes."" 
That could please gun-safety advocates like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, which has argued a small share of gun shops deserve the title of ""bad apples"" for failing to control their inventory.
For retailers, BlackRock said it is asking questions such as what strategies they use to prevent the potential misuse of guns, such as limits on bulk purchases.
BlackRock is the top shareholder in American Outdoor and Sturm Ruger and is second-largest in a third weapons producer, Vista Outdoor Inc. 
The three represent just 0.01 percent of total assets, BlackRock said, which could make it easy for the company to exclude them. A spokesman declined to offer more detail about what new index-based portfolios might look like.
BlackRock's investments in the gunmakers are held through passive products. BlackRock said it cannot sell securities held in such funds, leaving it with the responsibility to reach out to companies and, where necessary, to vote against directors or management.
BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink in recent years has emphasized the firm's focus on social and governance issues, aimed at reducing portfolio risk. That stance, along with the company's size has made it a focal point of gun-safety activists.
BlackRock had previously said it would engage with weapons companies, as have other firms including  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), but they have not offered as much detail about their questions to the industry.
Other big fund investors have not taken a public stance on gunmakers. Spokespeople for Vanguard Group and Fidelity have declined to discuss their engagement with specific companies. 
A representative for American Funds parent Capital Group said via e-mail on Friday that the firm is ""engaging with gun manufacturers to understand their plans to ensure the safe use of these products.""

Big retailers this week put in place new restrictions, such as a decision by Dick's Sporting Goods to halt the sale of assault-style rifles and to raise to 21 the minimum age to buy firearms.

453,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",How Trump Can Win Back Investors He Just Lost: Komal Sri-Kumar,"(Bloomberg View) -- President Donald Trump followed up on his threats to restrict imports, reduce the U.S. trade deficit and save jobs by announcing that he plans hefty tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The response in the markets was swift. Stocks tumbled and Treasuries rallied on concern that other nations will retaliate and set off a damaging trade war.
Is there a different path that could have positive implications for equity investors? As I suggested in a Bloomberg Prophets column in August, Trump has the option of pursuing a reduction in the trade deficit by increasing U.S. exports, shelving his administration’s focus on limiting imports. The severe market correction that could follow in a trade war makes this alternative approach an urgent one.
The trade expansion process could be achieved in several steps. First, the signing of the higher tariffs on steel and aluminum, currently set for next week, should be postponed as trade negotiators attempt to persuade foreign governments to open their markets to increased U.S. exports. Market expansion by countries involved should generally be easier to achieve than limiting markets through tariffs and quotas.
Second, the 11 countries that expect to sign the new Trans-Pacific Partnership on March 8 would prefer to have the U.S. be a part of their accord, enabling them to meet the powerful competition from Chinese exporters. Even though the U.S. would have to agree to terms already in place if it wants to join the TPP, it could shift the focus to U.S. firms being able to compete for contracts in those countries on an equal footing with domestic companies -- a development that would boost earnings of U.S. multinationals, reduce the current-account deficit, and create U.S. jobs.
Third, an agreement ought to be concluded soon regarding an interim extension of the North American Free Trade Agreement, boosting competitiveness of the U.S., Canada and Mexico in their trade with the rest of the world. Following this, trade expansion within the confines of Nafta should be the objective in 2019 after elections conclude this year in Mexico and the U.S.
Absent those moves, investors can expect more of the same from what they saw on Thursday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 420 points following Trump’s announcement, after having been up more than 150 points earlier in the day. It tumbled more than 300 points in early trading Friday. Investors are concerned that rather than helping boost employment as Trump hopes, a trade war would slow global growth and cause a loss of jobs in the U.S. and abroad as Europe, Asia and Latin America likely impose countervailing duties.
A trade war may be inevitable. In an early morning tweet Friday, Trump wrote that not only are trade wars good, they are easy to win. Recall that Trump withdrew the U.S. from the 12-country TPP in one of his earliest decisions after assuming the presidency. Even though Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated on Feb. 27 that the U.S. would consider rejoining the group, the 11 remaining countries have reached an accord that will be signed March 8. If the U.S. wants in, it will have to agree to the same terms as the other members -- something that is unlikely to find favor in the Trump administration.
The perfect storm on the trade front may be completed by developments relating to the Nafta. A revised version of the 24-year old accord had been expected by the end of 2017, but there is still no resolution in sight as negotiators from the U.S., Canada and Mexico pursue a seventh round of talks in Mexico City.
Canada’s chief Nafta negotiator, Steve Verheul, has criticized the U.S. for being inflexible, with positions driven from the top rather than with a give-and-take attitude. Canada has filed suit against the U.S. with the World Trade Organization alleging unfair use of tariffs to protect U.S. firms.
In Mexico, any major concession to help meet U.S. demands is likely to face criticism from Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the populist opposition candidate who is leading in the polls ahead of presidential elections on July 1. If Trump claims victory in Nafta negotiations, López Obrador’s ratings could get a boost and increase the probability that Mexico will seek to revise the agreement if he becomes president.
Trade has been a sleeper issue for global financial markets. No longer. Not handling trade carefully can end the equity rally that Trump sees as a sign of his policies’ success.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 12:18PM ET</span>","Diesel vehicle refits costly and could affect performance, Volkswagen says","BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is not against upgrading the exhaust systems of older diesel cars to make them cleaner, but could not afford to pay for such a huge undertaking itself and is concerned it might impair vehicle performance, its CEO said. 
After Germany's top administrative court on Tuesday allowed local authorities to bar heavily polluting diesel cars in major cities, the federal government is scrambling to find ways to avert driving bans that would hurt consumers and automakers.
Environmental and motorist lobbies are raising the pressure on Volkswagen (VW) and its peers to modify the exhaust systems of older diesels which they say are a major source of toxic nitrogen oxide emissions that can cause respiratory disease.
""I don't want to say now that I'm ruling it out,"" VW Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said on Friday at an auto industry event. But he voiced misgivings.
Hardware changes would cost between 1,500 ($1,845.30) and 7,000 euros per car, and the development as well as testing of new exhaust cleaning systems would take 2-3 years, Mueller said.
Also, retrofitted vehicles might consume more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide, which would affect the level of car tax, he added.
Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany's roads, only 2.7 million are equipped with the latest Euro-6 emissions technology. Research firm Evercore ISI has estimated that upgrading the exhaust cleaning of the 6 million Euro-5 vehicles could cost up to 14.5 billion euros ($17.9 billion).
""I would compare hardware changes on a Euro-5 vehicle to an open-heart surgery,"" Mueller said.
There is no way that VW could shoulder major costs for such modifications as it is stretched by the costs and fines related to its ""Dieselgate"" emissions scandal, he said.
""We had to pay about 25 billion in America, we cannot again pay 17 billion for hardware refits,"" Mueller said. ""That is simple not possible.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to unleash a trade war over steel crushed hopes of substantial progress in the latest talks to rework NAFTA, heightening fears for the trade deal's future.
Trump said on Thursday that a plan for protectionist tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum goods would be announced next week, following up on Twitter on Friday by calling trade wars ""good, and easy to win.""
Trump's statements have blunted efforts to renegotiate the 1990s-era North American Free Trade Agreement, which had already been disrupted by the early departure of a U.S. official handling one of the most divisive subjects, content rules for autos.
Asked how NAFTA negotiators could be working in good faith to update the deal while Trump talked approvingly about trade wars, a well-placed Canadian source replied: ""That's a very good question. I don't think there's an answer yet.""
Jerry Dias, head of Canadian private-sector union Unifor, said after meeting with Canada's chief negotiator on Friday that Trump's latest gambit to push his ""America First"" strategy immediately soured the negotiations.
""The Canadian team is absolutely furious,"" Dias told Reuters, saying Canada should walk away from the talks if it did not receive an exemption. He likened the Trump administration to a schoolyard bully.
""Ultimately Canada's going to have to start fighting fire with fire,"" he told reporters.
One Mexican official familiar with the process gave a terse appraisal of how Trump's announcement went down at the talks.
""Very bad news, very bad timing, very dangerous to go down this road,"" the official said.
Trade officials have become used to tensions sparked by Trump, and Mexico's chief NAFTA negotiator Kenneth Smith said the talks had not been affected by the steel announcement.
However, he said Mexico and Canada should be exempted from the measures as NAFTA allies of the United States.
It remains unclear whether the metals tariffs would apply to the United States' partners under NAFTA, which together account for more than $1 trillion worth of annual trilateral trade.
Canada, the biggest foreign supplier of steel and aluminum to the United States, is looking at ways to impose immediate sanctions on the United States if necessary, said the Canadian source.
Mexican officials said the government would likely wait for clarity on the matter before responding, but one said earlier this week that Mexico would hit back if subject to U.S. tariffs.
POLITICAL WILL
Officials say a handful of less contentious NAFTA chapters could still be concluded during the latest round of talks, and three people at the talks said the technical teams remained focused on their tasks, despite the uncertainty the steel tariff plan had caused.
Negotiators from the three countries have been meeting for six months and made few concrete announcements.
Expectations of progress at the seventh round in Mexico City had already been tempered by the conviction that major problem areas were unlikely to be removed without the mediation of senior political figures.
The risk of a tariff war between the NAFTA partners threw up new roadblocks.
Mexican steel industry association Canacero said it expected the government to take ""immediate reciprocal actions"" if the United States slapped the tariffs on Mexico, and agricultural lobbyists at the NAFTA talks also condemned the tariff plan.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of NAFTA if the deal is not recast to his liking, arguing that it has caused an exodus of U.S. manufacturing jobs to lower-cost Mexico.
Blindsided by Trump's steel announcement, participants at the talks are looking ahead to Monday's scheduled meeting between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Canada's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland and Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo for clarity on the path forward.

""It's not a question of what's achievable. Of course it's achievable,"" said one industry executive in Mexico close to the negotiations. ""It's a question of political will.""

459,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",U.S. seeks time to consider joining opioid litigation,"By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has asked a federal judge overseeing hundreds of lawsuits against opioid manufacturers and distributors to give it 30 days to decide whether to participate in the litigation.
The department made the request in papers filed in federal court in Cleveland late on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in the day called for a federal lawsuit against companies over their roles in the opioid epidemic.
The Justice Department asked U.S. District Judge Dan Polster to give it time to evaluate participating in the litigation, citing the ""substantial costs that the federal government has borne as a result of the opioid epidemic.""
It cited estimates made by the White House Council of Economic Advisers in November that opioid abuse cost the U.S. economy as much as $504 billion in 2015.
""The economic burden from the opioid epidemic includes considerable costs associated with the medical treatment of opioid users,"" the Justice Department said.
As just one example of the costs federal agencies have incurred for treatment, the U.S. Defense Department's costs for care related to opioid use and dependence were $82 million in 2017, the Justice Department said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 42,000 people died from opioid overdoses in 2016, the last year with publicly available data. 
Thursday's filing came after U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions on Tuesday announced the department would file a statement of interest in cases consolidated before Polster, saying the federal government would seek reimbursement for the cost of the epidemic.
The judge is overseeing at least 355 lawsuits filed by cities, counties and others against opioid manufacturers and distributors generally seeking to recover the costs they had incurred grappling with the public health crisis.
Polster has been pushing for a quick, global settlement in the litigation, and has invited state attorneys general who have cases in state courts or who are conducting a multistate probe of the companies to participate in those talks.
The lawsuits have generally accused the drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and allege distributors ignored red flags indicating the painkillers were being diverted for improper uses.
The defendants include opioid manufacturers Purdue Pharma LP, Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA) Industries Ltd (TA:TEVA), Endo International PLC (O:ENDP) and Allergan PLC (N:AGN) and drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp (N:ABC),  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) and McKesson Corp (N:MCK).
The first settlement hearing was held in January. A second one is expected on Tuesday.

(Reuters) - Insurer American International Group Inc (N:AIG) on Friday said that it has struck a deal with online travel services provider Brand  Expedia  Group (O:EXPE) to sell travel insurance to the company's global customers.
The move is part of a strategy by AIG Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault to grow the insurance giant and expand its global reach. 
AIG's agreement with Expedia marks its second travel insurance deal in five months. In October, the insurer said it had reached an agreement to sell travel insurance to United Airlines (N:UAL) customers.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
In January, AIG said it would buy reinsurer Validus Holdings Ltd (VR.N) for $5.56 billion in cash, ending a long period of retrenchment for the insurer, which had dramatically shrunk since its near-death experience during the 2008 financial crisis.
Travel insurance is seen by industry sources as a low-risk business and steady revenue generator. But insurers need scale for it to significantly boost their bottom lines, said Sandler O'Neill analyst Paul Newsome. 
""It's almost certainly not a material change, but it's a really nice feather in (AIG's) cap,"" Newsome said of the Expedia deal. ""It's nice to have a high-profile transaction that maybe adds some confidence to people looking at AIG.""
The latest deal gives U.S. Expedia customers the option to buy AIG travel insurance when booking flights, hotels, travel packages and cruises on Expedia sites, including Expedia.com, CheapTickets, Orbitz and Travelocity.
The companies plan to expand the offering worldwide.

A travel services business line of broker Aon Plc (N:AON) will continue to handle U.S. customer claims, the companies said.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday unveiled criminal charges against 10 defendants, including London-based brokerage Beaufort Securities Ltd, over their alleged roles in a more than $50 million stock fraud and a laundering scheme involving a late work by Pablo Picasso.
Prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, said Beaufort and two of its managers, Peter Kyriacou and Vinesh Canaye, defrauded investors from March 2014 to February 2018 by hiding their ownership in and manipulating prices of U.S. stocks, including through ""pump-and-dump"" schemes.
It also said eight defendants, including offshore bank Loyal Bank Ltd, schemed to launder fraud proceeds.
One scheme allegedly occurred from October 2017 to February 2018, when according to prosecutors Kyriacou and London art gallery owner Matthew Green tried to launder 6.7 million British pounds ($9.2 million) that an undercover law enforcement agent claimed were fraud proceeds.
According to the indictment, Kyriacou sent the agent a WhatsApp message on Feb. 19 with an invoice from Green's Mayfair Fine Art Ltd for Picasso's ""Personnages, Painted 11 April 1965,"" and later forwarded a message from Green stressing the need ""to preserve a certain amount of anonymity.""
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also announced separate civil fraud charges against Beaufort and Kyriacou over alleged manipulative trading in the microcap stock HD View 360 Inc , a provider of security surveillance systems.
Separately, the UK Financial Conduct Authority declared Beaufort insolvent and appointed administrators for it.
""The defendants engaged in an elaborate multi-year scheme to defraud the investing public of millions of dollars through deceit and manipulative stock trading, and then worked to launder the fraudulent proceeds through off-shore bank accounts and the art world,"" U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue in Brooklyn said in a statement.
Six individuals and four corporate entities were charged in the criminal case.
A lawyer for Canaye, 30, of Mauritius, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for the other defendants could not immediately be identified.
Beaufort and Loyal Bank, which has offices in Budapest, Hungary, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Kyriacou, 26, of London, did not immediately respond to a similar request. Green, 50, also of London, could not immediately be reached.

HD View's chief executive officer, Dennis Mancino, 46, of Miami, was arrested on Thursday and charged with conspiring to manipulate its stock. The company had no immediate comment.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. pizza brand Sbarro [SBARO.UL] is re-entering the Russian market, encouraged by a nascent economic recovery but wary of taking aggressive steps after its long-time franchisee fell prey to a downturn.
Once Russia's top pizza chain, Sbarro saw most of its outlets shut in the past few years after its local partner got into financial trouble when oil prices collapsed and the West imposed sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine. 
Rival brands Papa John's (O:PZZA) and Domino's (N:DPZ) have expanded aggressively in Russia in the past several years, and last year announced plans to move beyond the capital.
Sbarro, a fast-food chain known for its thin, hand-tossed pizza, signed up a new franchise deal for Russia last September, partnering with HoReCa Band Group which unveiled plans to open more than 300 restaurants by 2027.
David Karam, Sbarro's chief executive and co-owner, told Reuters he expected the new franchisee to build a significant presence for the brand but was against a breakneck expansion.
""If they fulfill their goals and their commitments, Sbarro will have a very substantial presence in the Russian market, there is no doubt about that,"" Karam said in a recent interview in a Moscow shopping mall where HoReCa Band Group opened its second Sbarro restaurant in late December. 
""I want them to be deliberate, find good sites, especially in this early stage to make sure that they are moving at the appropriate pace. If you rush it off ... it creates some vulnerability,"" he said.
""It's not so much about just growing: the business has to be profitable.""
Sbarro entered the Russian market shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union along with other global brands which rushed to cater to the underserved market.
Its second foray comes at a challenging time: competition has soared.
""There is no question – it's a more challenging period to re-establish a dominant position... I believe though that it was not that long ago that customers were visiting Sbarro so it's still going to be a fresh recall,"" Karam said.
HoReCa Band Group plans to open 10 to 12 Sbarro restaurants in Moscow this year and a further 14 to 16 are expected to be added in other regions by subfranchisees, its spokeswoman said.
Russian retail sales rose 2.8 percent in January in year-on-year terms and are expected to grow by 2.7 percent this year, with anticipated interest rate cuts seen boosting consumer demand. 
Karam said he was optimistic about Russia's economy and did not expect Moscow's tensions with the United States to be an issue.
""Is there a risk that some consumers might apply a kind of political filter in where they choose to eat pizza? Perhaps, but if they do, it will not be good for Domino's and Papa John’s,"" he said.
""I think consumers tend to act in their own self interest ... So if we're successfully positioning the Sbarro brand locally, we'll do fine, regardless of the political situation.""
The Russian economy expanded 1.5 percent last year after two years of recession and growth is expected to speed up slightly in 2018, buoyed by firmer oil prices.
Karam said the biggest challenge for Sbarro as it was re-entering the market was ""getting the word out"". To boost appeal for sophisticated consumers, Sbarro has tightened focus on the New York-style pizza, shrinking the menu and emphasizing fresh preparation. 
Russia's ban on most Western food imports since August 2014, in retaliation for Western sanctions over Ukraine, had been a ""great challenge"" and although Sbarro has now fully adapted, it not being able to leverage its global buying power was hurting the business.

""Our hope is the trade restrictions pass away,"" Karam said.

468,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",Bull Market Poise Gone Missing From S&P 500 as Bad Days Pile Up,"(Bloomberg) -- While it’s tempting to portray recent turbulence in U.S. equities as a return to normalcy, be advised: the S&P 500 Index is swinging around in a way that is beyond what is usually seen in bull markets.
Two months into the new year, the equity benchmark has notched 15 days in which it moved 1 percent or more in either direction. That’s almost twice as many as the whole year of 2017.
At 36 percent of all trading sessions, the frequency of big days is higher than in all bull market years since World War II except one. That was 2011, when a downgrade of the U.S. sovereign rating sent the index to the brink of a bear market decline of 20 percent.
Gone are the calm days. In their place are lurches and rebounds, as investors reassess the durability of the nine-year equity rally. Lately, the prevailing direction has been down.
From surging inflation to the implosion of volatility-related products and the danger of a trade war, bad news keeps zapping stocks. Even the synchronized global recovery, a thesis that fueled the latest rally in equities, was called into question over the past week as manufacturing data from Europe to China to Japan signaled a cooling in expansions.
Add renewed uncertainty over monetary policy as Jerome Powell took the helm of the Federal Reserve, and it’s not hard to see why the market is so excitable. The S&P 500 has changed 0.9 percent a day since January, triple the average from last year. Should the market volatility stay elevated, the spike in daily swings would be the biggest on record."

Bean will raise the minimum age for purchasers of guns to 21 from 18, joining a list of retailers putting restrictions on firearm sales following a mass shooting at a Florida high school last month.
""In the wake of this shooting we have reviewed our policy on firearm sales, and we will no longer be selling guns or ammunition to anyone under the age of 21,"" L.L. Bean said in a tweet on Thursday.
The company said it sold firearms only at its flagship store in Maine and those guns only focused on hunting. 
It does not sell assault-style firearms, high-capacity firearms, bump stocks or handguns, L.L. Bean tweeted on Friday.

The announcement comes after similar moves by Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc, and two weeks after social media-savvy students at the Florida high school ignited an intense debate on gun control in the United States following the deadly shooting.

(Reuters) - The second-largest U.S. nursing home operator, HCR ManorCare, will file for Chapter 11 protection in the coming days and transfer ownership to its landlord,  Quality Care Properties Inc  (N:QCP), the latest sign of distress in the senior housing industry.
Quality Care, a real estate investment trust, announced the agreement on Friday, saying it would become the full owner of Toledo, Ohio-based ManorCare's skilled nursing, assisted living, hospice and homecare businesses across the United States.
Shares of Quality Care, which will give up its REIT status, jumped 23.4 percent to $15.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.
HCR ManorCare had owed its landlord more than $300 million in rent, according to regulatory filings. It is one of several large U.S. nursing home chains that have struggled to keep up with rent payments due to changing Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements for nursing homes, rising costs and low occupancy rates.
""This agreement facilitates a consensual resolution that provides stability and flexibility for the business. We see this as the best available opportunity to improve a challenging situation,"" Quality Care Chief Executive Mark Ordan said.
Reuters first reported the deal, citing sources, earlier on Friday. 
ManorCare is owned by private equity firm  Carlyle Group  (O:CG), which bought the chain in a 2007 leveraged buyout for $6.3 billion. In a move to unlock value, it sold the properties to real estate investment trust  HCP Inc  (N:HCP) for $6.1 billion in 2010. 
HCP spun off the ManorCare properties to Quality Care in 2016 as a sector downturn made it difficult for HCR ManorCare to keep up rent payments agreed under a master lease.
""The lease had very real implications on HCR's health and ability to deal with the headwinds that the industry is facing,"" Fitch analyst Britton Costa said.
HCR ManorCare's Chapter 11 filing will not impact patient care or the operations of its subsidiaries, which are not filing for bankruptcy, its landlord said in a statement. 
Quality Care will put its own management team in place at ManorCare after bankruptcy court approval, which is expected in the second quarter. The companies did not provide any financial details as part of the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter.
Among other struggling chains, the largest nursing home operator Genesis Healthcare Inc (N:GEN) avoided a bankruptcy filing last week after it reached a restructuring deal with its lender and REIT landlords.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Several  Novartis  (S:NOVN) shareholders urged the Swiss drugmaker on Friday to improve its oversight of staff, amid a widening probe into allegations that managers paid bribes to doctors and public officials in Greece. 
Greece's parliament voted last week to investigate 10 politicians in the case, in addition to an ongoing probe of the Basel-based company after a raid a year ago of its offices in Athens.
Over the weekend, about 30 self-proclaimed Greek anarchists threw paint and smashed windows at the entrance of the Athens headquarters. The Rouvikonas group said the attack was linked to the bribery probe.
Mike Moran of Suishare, a small not-for-profit shareholders group that focuses on business ethics, told Novartis's board of directors on Friday he was worried the investigation could prove to be a long-term headache for the company.
""I think the Greek thing will be the swamp that keeps on giving,"" Moran said at the company's annual shareholder meeting.
Other investors also expressed concern, with one calling for executives to exert greater ""moral influence"" after a series of costly legal problems. 
Since 2015, Novartis has paid out hundreds of millions in settlements and fines as a result of kickback allegations in South Korea, the United States and China.
""Corruption cannot be allowed to become a tradition,"" said Veronika Hendry, president of the sustainable investing proxy group Actares. 
Novartis, which on Sunday condemned the violence at its Athens office and called on Greek police to protect its employees, has said it will take ""fast and decisive action"" should evidence of unethical or illegal behavior emerge.
Chairman Joerg Reinhardt underscored that pledge on Friday.
""We will continue to do whatever we can to clarify the situation,"" Reinhardt said. ""If anybody was responsible for any misdeed, we will act accordingly.""
Questioned about Novartis's pay system which includes bonuses for meeting targets, Reinhardt acknowledged risks associated with monetary rewards but said he and other officials including new Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan aimed to make sure rigorous controls are in place to prevent abuses.
""I know Mr. Narasimhan has a very close eye on this,"" he said. 
Shareholders overwhelmingly approved a pay plan for Novartis executive committee and board members including Narasimhan that could total 100 million Swiss francs ($107 million) for 2018-2019. They also approved the other board proposals.
Novartis shares were down 1.2 percent at 1330 GMT, mirroring the SIX Swiss Exchange.

PARIS (Reuters) - A senior Airbus executive has urged Britain's government to provide clarity on post-Brexit customs rules as the planemaker faces an immediate rise in spending to start preparing for possible delays in the movement of parts.
Tom Williams, chief operating officer of the planemaking business of Europe's largest aerospace company, said Airbus is strongly committed to its British factories as long as they can be run with the same efficiency as before.
""We are coming to quite a momentous event. The important message we try to put across to ministers is we are only a year away now; the clock's running pretty fast,"" Williams said in a video conveyed to Airbus's 14,000 UK staff via YouTube.
Due to long lead times, Airbus is facing immediate decisions on whether to increase spending on parts in order to build up an extra buffer stock to cope with potential disruption when Britain leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019, he said.
Airbus's operations in the UK, where it makes wings for all its jetliners, rely on a ""just-in-time"" inventory policy and the ability to move ""working parties"" of employees across borders to cope with specific problems, Williams said.
""If we think there is going to be a kind of gumming up of the docks and the airports, certainly in March of next year and during a transition period, then clearly from our point of view we are going to have to start ordering additional components now, because it is less than 12 months away. And that is at a time when all of our suppliers are already pretty busy,"" he said.
An Airbus spokesman said it was not yet possible to estimate the cost of such an increase in inventories.
Williams' comments place Airbus at the center of a political debate over post-Brexit customs rules and emerged as Prime Minister Theresa May was preparing to set out her vision for Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the EU.
May has said Britain will not join a customs union with the EU after Brexit, delighting some Brexit supporters who say staying in a customs union would prevent other trade deals.
But the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, has backed Britain forging a new customs union with the EU. He wants to join forces with rebel Conservative lawmakers to block May's plans in a vote in parliament due in coming months.
Under a 1980 agreement among 32 members of the World Trade Organization, civil aerospace parts are not subject to duties.
But the aerospace industry is concerned that extra paperwork caused by new customs borders could introduce costly delays. 

ADS, a UK trade association for the aerospace, defense, security and space sectors, has welcomed Corbyn's backing for a customs union with the EU, and suggested that new processes could otherwise cost the sector 1.5 billion pounds a year.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 11:38AM ET</span>","J.C. Penney sees year profit largely below Wall Street, shares dive","By Richa Naidu and Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) forecast broadly lower-than-expected full-year profit on Friday as the department store operator grapples with weak demand for its clothes and fierce online competition, sending its stock down 10 percent.
The downbeat forecast, on top of fourth-quarter same-store sales below Wall Street's estimates, surprised investors after the retailer said in January it had seen strong demand for home, beauty products and jewelry during the holiday shopping season.
The results lagged relatively strong holiday-quarter reports from Macy's Inc (N:M), Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) and  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) earlier this week.
J.C. Penney forecast full-year earnings of between 5 cents and 25 cents per share, largely below analysts' average estimate of 20 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
That was ""most disconcerting,"" said Ken Perkins at industry research firm Retail Metrics, given that retailers potentially stand to benefit from greater customer spending this year after recent tax cuts.
""We want to get into a habit of under-promising and over-delivering,"" Chief Executive Marvin Ellison said on a call to discuss earnings, telling analysts he expected better margins in 2018. He said J.C. Penney would gain market share this year from struggling rivals closing stores.
""There is over a $9 billion category overlap in the malls that we occupy with retailers that are in distress, and we say that as an opportunity for us to get a greater share of that,"" said Ellison. 
Many retailers have been forced to shutter stores and slash jobs as they rethink their structures in the face of competition from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and other online retailers.
'PLAYING CATCH-UP'
J.C. Penney said on Friday it cut 360 jobs as part of restructuring and cost-cutting efforts that are expected to save between $20 million and $25 million in costs annually. 
That follows the company's announcement last month that it would close its Milwaukee distribution and customer care center and cut about 670 jobs. The retailer and its subsidiaries had about 106,000 full-time and part-time employees at the end of January 2017.
The Plano, Texas-based retailer, which is nearing the end of a years-long turnaround plan, shuttered 141 stores last year, and has said it will close eight more this year.
For the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, comparable-store sales at J.C. Penney rose 2.6 percent, missing analysts' average estimate of a 2.94 percent increase.
Ellison said the company was ""still playing catch-up"" in activewear, and that fixing the women's apparel business, particularly dresses, contemporary and casual sportswear, would be a strategic priority this year. He said he expected women's and kids' apparel to report positive first-quarter same-store sales growth.
""Apparel has been a sore spot for them for some time and they have quite a bit of floor space dedicated to it,"" said Perkins, noting the retailer has been losing market share to Macy's, Kohl's and T.J. Maxx (N:TJX). ""It's one of those things they are going to have to get right relatively soon."" 
Net profit rose to $254 million in the fourth quarter from $192 million a year earlier, helped by a $75 million boost from tax reforms in the United States passed in December.

Excluding one-time items, J.C. Penney earned 57 cents per share, ahead of the analysts' estimates of 47 cents.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan's Honda Motor Co (T:7267) has halted new sales of CR-V crossovers in China and may have to do the same with its Civic model after a Chinese watchdog rejected the automaker's plan to recall 350,000 of the cars to fix a problem.
The company had planned to address a cold-climate engine problem on two of its top-selling models in two phases, recalling CR-V sport utility vehicles from late February and Civics from early March.
A Honda spokesman said on Friday China's quality control watchdog considered its plan insufficient, leading Honda to stop sales of new CR-Vs until a new recall plan had been agreed. 
The company's problems in the world's biggest auto market highlight what appears to be an emerging trend, where Chinese customers air their complaints on Weibo - the country's Twitter equivalent - and other social media, forcing carmakers to act.
With complaints from CR-V and Civic owners pouring out in mid-January, Honda devised a recall plan in only about a month.
Honda had said on Feb. 12 it intended to recall roughly 350,000 CR-Vs and Civics equipped with a 1.5-litre turbo engine. Both affected models have been sold by Honda’s joint venture with China's  Dongfeng Motor Group  Co Ltd (HK:0489). 
The Honda spokesman said company officials earlier this week went to China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine to explain its plan.
On Thursday, the agency said in a statement on its official website that Honda's proposals were “not enough.” 
“The company needs to improve the recall plans further,” it said, suggesting Honda could extend the warranty coverage period of the affected cars. 
The Honda spokesman said its officials were expected to go back to the agency with a revised plan soon. He did not elaborate.
The recalls are aimed at fixing a problem caused by an unusual amount of un-combusted petrol collecting in the engine’s lubricant oil pan.
The issue in some cases caused a strong odor of gasoline inside the car and in others the car’s check-engine light came on. Honda and Dongfeng plan to resolve the issue by updating the engine’s gasoline injection control software.

Honda officials said there had been no reports of accidents.

On Thursday, Trump said the duties -- 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum -- would be formally announced next week, although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out.
""We are putting it on hold. We believe that tariffs could cause a pretty significant increase in the price of steel on the U.S. market,"" Electrolux spokesman Daniel Frykholm said.
Electrolux buys all the steel it uses in its U.S. products domestically. 
""So this is not the possibility of tariffs directly impacting our costs, but rather the impact it could have on the market and that it could damage the overall competitiveness of our operations in the U.S.,"" Frykholm said.
The company is waiting to see the final details of the U.S. plans before making a final decision, he said.

Electrolux had said in January it would invest $250 million to expand and modernize its plant in Springfield, Tennessee.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended another turbulent week on an upbeat note Friday, but major indexes posted their worst week of losses since early February as President Donald Trump's threat to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum rattled investors.
The gains on Friday came as investors who had been spooked by the prospect of a global trade war backed off those concerns and noted a trade war was far from certain at this point.
Trump on Thursday threatened a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum without exemptions for any countries, igniting a selloff in a market already on edge over rising U.S. interest rates and bond yields.
Trump struck a defiant tone on Friday, saying trade wars were ""good, and easy to win"", and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, appearing on CNBC, said tariffs would have a ""trivial effect."" 
Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York, said Trump's announcement was made to call everyone's attention to the U.S. trade deficit but investors decided that a full-blown global trade was not going to happen. 
""For a real estate guy like that, you pound the podium, you rattle some sabers, you get everybody's attention and then you negotiate back to some reasonable midpoint.""
The tariffs could dampen profits for everything from car makers to beer companies and result in higher prices for consumers.
Shares of big U.S. steel companies and manufacturers were under pressure on uncertainty over the effects of tariffs.
Shares in  Caterpillar  (N:CAT), a buyer of raw materials and a big exporter of construction machinery products, were down 2.6 percent after falling 2.8 percent in the previous day's session. General Motors (N:GM) was down 1 percent.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 70.92 points, or 0.29 percent, to 24,538.06, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 13.58 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,691.25 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 77.31 points, or 1.08 percent, to 7,257.87.
For the week, the S&P 500 dropped 2 percent, while the Dow was down 3 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1 percent. Wall Street had posted gains in the previous two weeks as it recovered from its steep early-February selloff.
Those losses in early February pushed the S&P 500 down more than 10 percent from a Jan. 26 record high, confirming the market was in a correction.
The tariffs are unlikely to significantly hurt Corporate America's overall earnings, according to stock market strategists, who were not immediately adjusting their profit estimates following Trump's announcement.
""The impact on total corporate earnings first would be driven by the impact on the economy,"" said Keith Parker, U.S. equity strategist for UBS in New York.
McDonald's (N:MCD) dropped 4.8 percent after RBC lowered its price target on the stock and cut its 2018 earnings estimate, citing a disappointing early sales impact from McDonald's value menu. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P and the Dow. 
J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) shares fell 5.4 percent after the department store chain missed same-store sales estimates.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.99-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 25 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 59 new highs and 65 new lows.

About 7.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.4 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

519,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 06:51AM ET</span>","Ukraine switches power plants to fuel oil, closes schools to save gas","KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine has switched power plants to fuel oil from gas in an effort to make up for an emergency shortage after Russian company Gazprom (MM:GAZP) declined to resume gas supplies to the country, Energy Minister Ihor Nasalyk said on Friday.
The shortfall comes at a time of peak demand after a Europe-wide cold snap blanketed most of Ukraine with heavy snow and pushed temperatures well below freezing. 
Nasalyk told parliament the lack of Russian supplies had created a deficit of up to 20 million cubic meters (mcm) of gas per day. Thermal power plants switching to fuel oil could save around 15 million mcm a day, he said.
The Energy Ministry also asked local authorities to suspend lessons at schools, universities and kindergartens until March 6.
The gas shortage equates to one tenth of Ukraine's daily consumption of around 200 mcm.
On Thursday, Gazprom said it had returned a prepayment to Ukraine and would not restart gas supplies as an additional agreement to the existing arrangements had not yet been reached. Ukraine said it would seek compensation.
The row represents a new front in a long-running legal battle, a by-product of broader political tension following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.
It follows Wednesday's international arbitration court order for Gazprom to pay $2.56 billion to Ukraine's Naftogaz after weighing mutual claims and counter-claims related to gas supplies and transit.
The decision was welcomed in Ukraine as a major win for Naftogaz. Gazprom has said it will contest the ruling.

523,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 08:26AM ET</span>",China's latest conglomerate crackdown casts dealmaking shadow,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Matthew Miller
HONG KONG (Reuters) - When news broke this week that the chairman of CEFC China Energy, an acquisitive conglomerate, was being investigated for economic crimes, one particular group gulped - dealmakers involved with Chinese companies.
Even as China's fast-growing conglomerates have been viewed by many global investors and regulators with suspicion for their opacity and finances, they have nonetheless been lucrative business partners for dealmakers, known for paying over the odds for flashy assets. 
Now, more than ever before, would-be acquirers, sellers, investors and advisors are having to assess who is in and who is out in Beijing, a politically tricky question at the best of times. 
The probe into CEFC - which has thrown into question its $9 billion deal for a 14 percent stake in Rosneft, Russia's top oil producer - came less than a week after the government announced it was taking control of the insurer Anbang, an equally eye-catching acquirer of assets. Anbang's chairman, Wu Xiaohui, is being prosecuted for economic crimes.
The upheavals of the past weeks have left many dealmakers nervous - and unwilling to comment publicly about a topic so clearly sensitive in Beijing. The State Council Information Office, the Chinese government's information arm, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters.
Strategies on how best to navigate the latest upheaval range from focusing on top executives' political connections to analyzing debt levels and the growth potential of the companies involved.
""It's taken that if you are a major Chinese company, in all likelihood, there is significant government influence,"" said Edward Mermelstein, a partner at Rheem, Bell & Mermelstein in New York. ""It's just a question of to what extent is there significant government influence."" 
Said a Hong Kong-based M&A banker at a global investment bank: ""It will be just another reason for foreign sell-side folks to be very suspicious of major Chinese acquisitions, yet another hurdle that the Chinese firms will need to go across."" 
Companies who appear to have Beijing's backing include the carmaker Geely and, Fosun (HK:0656), another conglomerate with a one-time penchant for flashy deals, including a stake in Cirque du Soleil.
Geely last week stunned  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) with its sudden acquisition of a $9 billion, 9.7 percent stake in the German owner of Mercedes-Benz. 
Meanwhile, Fosun has in the past week snapped up two European fashion labels and taken control of a Brazilian broker in deals worth a combined $245 million.
DIFFERENTIATING DEALMAKERS
Beijing first put dealmaking conglomerates on notice last summer with a crackdown on their access to credit in the mainland and an edict barring ""irrational"" investments. 
Since then, groups including Dalian Wanda and HNA Group have scrambled to ease the resulting cash crunch by offloading assets and changing business models while also pursuing more Beijing-friendly investment strategies. 
Many bankers and other deal advisers are now pointing to the differences in financing style and even ambition as a way of distinguishing between groups who are in or out of favor. 
Anbang, for example, has long been considered a quixotic dealmaker - its best-known asset is the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York. Its financing too has been questioned because much of it came from selling illiquid insurance and savings products, many with shadow banking links, to small investors, according to several regulatory and insurance industry insiders. 
That sort of activity has been a particular focus of Chinese authorities worried about risks in the financial system.
""Anbang was an exception on a few fronts."" said one western bank's China M&A head. ""They were regulated, they were obviously too high profile for their own good, they were buying things the government doesn't necessarily favor – like hotels and property.""
CEFC also transformed rapidly from a niche fuel trader into an oil and finance conglomerate, with an ambition to become an energy giant to rival China's state-owned behemoths. Ye Jianming, CEFC's chairman and founder, also had a high profile outside his homeland. 
In 2016, Ye ranked above French President Emmanuel Macron in Fortune magazine's '40 Under 40' list of the world's most influential young people and in 2015, he was appointed an advisor to the Czech president on economic policies. 
CEFC's overseas holdings include property, a brewer, a football stadium and an airline. However, little is known about how Ye raised the money to build CEFC or its ownership structure.
By contrast, a perceived strength of Geely's chairman, Li Shufu, has been his company's single-minded focus on cars and developing electric vehicles - sectors aligned closely with Beijing's priorities - as well as a track record for managing acquisitions, notably that of Sweden's Volvo in 2010. 
Some dealmakers are openly confident. This week, Fosun's chairman, Guo Guangchang, told the Financial Times that he planned more overseas deals and that his company's acquisitions were approved by the Chinese government.
He told the newspaper: ""The Chinese government is very law oriented so they support the companies who respect the law.""
HNA and Geely declined to comment, and Fosun did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Attempts to request comment from Anbang went unanswered.
CEFC issued a statement Thursday disputing reports that its chairman was being investigated and said that it was ""operating normally"".
WHAT, OR WHO IS NEXT?
Some investors are wondering if HNA might be the next to come under government pressure. The sprawling conglomerate warned creditors in January of a $2.4 billion shortfall in its ability to meet interest payments due this quarter and has suspended trading in several of its listed units pending restructuring news. 
There are as yet no signs of direct government involvement. 
In December, eight banks, including China Development Bank and China's ""Big Four"" state-backed lenders met with HNA to discuss their lending to the group.
Analysts said they were braced for further developments among China's conglomerates but cautioned that the whole saga should be viewed within a longer perspective of Beijing's battle to rein in leverage and cut corruption.
Many top corporate executives in China have been reported to be detained in the past as part of regulatory crackdown on corruption, though in most cases little details were given about those allegations. 
""This is just a natural progression of China cementing its power but also its crackdown on corruption,"" said Will Ballard, head of emerging market equities at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors.

525,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 08:52AM ET</span>","Exclusive: GM plants to cut 5,000 South Korean jobs","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean unit plans to slash 5,000 jobs, or about 30 percent of its workforce, but keep production steady if Seoul agrees to its $2.8 billion proposal for the loss-making operation, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The U.S. automaker announced last month that it would shut down a factory in Gunsan, southwest of Seoul, and that it was mulling the fate of its three other plants in South Korea. 
The Detroit automaker, which owns 77 percent of GM Korea, is negotiating with the South Korean government over the restructuring proposal, as state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) owns a 17 percent stake. GM's main Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104), controls the remaining 6 percent.
In the plan it submitted to the government and seen by Reuters, GM Korea proposed cutting the number of employees to 11,000 from about 16,000.
Because only 2,000 people work at the Gunsan facility, it appears the other factories will also be affected. The document did not specify when the cuts would occur.
GM's proposal may put the Seoul government in a bind, as President Moon Jae-in seeks to save thousands of jobs but could face a public backlash if he uses taxpayer money as a lifeline for GM.
The document also showed GM plans to over 10 years create 1,100 new jobs, plus build two new sports utility vehicle (SUV) models and a compact car engine in South Korea.
The government has said it would decide on whether to provide support after conducting due diligence on what it has called GM's ""opaque"" management of its operations in the country.
GM Korea declined to comment on details of the proposal.
""We will reduce our cost base to make our business profitable,"" a GM spokesman said, adding it has been undertaking a series of restructuring actions.
The U.S. automaker is seeking concessions on wages from an angry labor union and launched a voluntary redundancy program, which closes on Friday.
A spokeswoman for trade ministry declined to comment. 
U.S. MARKET 
Under the plan, GM would add its next-generation Trax small SUV and a brand-new compact SUV to its Korean production lines in 2020 and 2022 respectively, the document said. 
The models are mainly aimed at the U.S. market, it said. 
It plans to manufacture 200,000 vehicles of each, and keep its overall production in Korea near 500,000 per year over the next 10 years. GM produced about 508,000 cars last year, far below the combined capacity of 910,000 cars per year at its Korean factories.
South Korea was for years a low-cost export hub for GM, producing about a fifth of the company's global output of Chevy models at its peak. But the automaker's decision to exit other unprofitable markets has exacerbated problems for GM Korea, which built many of the Chevrolet models GM once offered in Europe.

GM Korea reported on Friday that its domestic car sales slumped 48 percent in February.

528,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 03:20AM ET</span>",Australia's banking watchdog flags end of investor credit cap,"By Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's banking regulator is considering removing a cap on loans designed to curb speculators from driving a debt-fuelled bubble in the country's property market.
Australian  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority (APRA) Chairman Wayne Byres told a parliamentary committee on Thursday the 10 percent annual limit it set on investor credit last year was ""probably reaching the end of its useful life"".
The tighter regulations, which also include a 30 percent cap to new interest-only loans, have helped slow down lending and cool prices. 
Home values across Australia's major cities fell for a fifth straight month in February with the once red-hot Sydney market now offering negative returns. 
Investor loan growth was now well below 5 percent, half the rate in 2014, the regulator said. New interest-only loans had fallen by a third to about 20 percent. 
""We think the quality of lending the banking system is doing today is certainly higher and better than it was a few years ago,"" Byres said. 
""The general dynamics in the market suggest it (the cap) is potentially becoming redundant, although there are some institutions still growing quite quickly.""
Removing the cap would allow the banks to increase the number of investor loans they write, stimulating credit. 
But looming new capital rules will allocate more risk and capital to investor loans, potentially more than offseting the impact of any rollback of the cap.
On Friday, Westpac said it would raise rates by 1-25 basis points for all types of fixed-rate mortgages, with effect from March 7.
""These changes align with our goal to manage revenue, growth, margin, portfolio composition and risk,"" a Westpac spokesperson said.
Australia's major banks, Commonwealth Bank (AX:CBA), National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), last year controversially cited tighter lending rules to justify mortgage rate increases.
The so called ""Big Four"" control 80 percent of the lending market and have posted record profits for years. They have been mired in controversy and scandal recently, including allegations of interest-rate rigging. 
Out-of-cycle mortgage rate rise, one that is not in tandem with moves in the official cash rates, have generated the biggest public outcry, as home-owners struggle to meet high repayments in the face of sluggish wage growth.
The banks reported a combined net profit of A$31.5 billion ($24.4 billion) in the 2017 fiscal year, up 6.4 percent on a year ago, according to KPMG.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp (T:5401), Japan's biggest steelmaker, will raise domestic capital spending by 35 percent over the next three years to upgrade aging plants and triple its investment budget to step up global expansion. 
Nippon Steel, the world's fourth-biggest steelmaker by crude steel output, outlined its new three-year business plan starting in April in a statement on Friday. The company said it will earmark a total of 1.7 trillion yen ($16 billion) for domestic capital expenditures, up from 1.26 trillion yen spent over the previous three years.
Japanese steelmakers, including smaller rival JFE Steel, a unit of JFE Holdings Inc (T:5411), are making hefty investments in aging domestic plants. Glitches at the plants - some more than 40 years old - have prevented them from manufacturing as much steel as they would have liked.
Nippon Steel also plans to set aside 600 billion yen for business investment, including for mergers and acquisitions (M&A), for the next three years, up from 210 billion yen spent over the previous three years. 
""We are boosting our investment budget to move quickly with more flexibility when the alliance or big M&A opportunity arises,"" Nippon Steel President Kosei Shindo told a news conference.
""On top of our existing business models of exporting products from Japan and processing products in overseas, we will consider taking in some overseas steelworks that are equipped with blast furnaces and processing lines,"" he said.
As a first step, Nippon Steel said it would jointly bid for bankrupt steelmaker Essar Steel India Ltd with ArcelorMittal SA (AS:MT), the world's largest steelmaker.
If their bid to acquire Essar succeeds, it would help Nippon Steel tap into the Indian market ""where steel demand is expected to grow sharply in the mid- and long-term"" and be a key growth driver for the company, Shindo said.
Under the new business plan, the Japanese company aims to raise its return on equity to 10 percent in the year to March 2021, against 5.3 percent for the current year, and boost its dividend ratio to around 30 percent in 2020/21, up from its current target of 20 percent to 30 percent.
To raise its steel output, Nippon will start operating a new blast furnace, already built in Wakayama in western Japan, sometime around March 2019. The company will then close the existing 30-year-old blast furnace at the plants, which is the world's oldest blast furnace in operation.
The switch will boost its annual crude steel output capacity by 500,000 tonnes.

540,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 04:27PM ET</span>",Earnings boost for stocks may lose luster with rising yields,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - There is little doubt on Wall Street that U.S. corporate profits are on track to rise at a healthy rate this year, with an overall estimate for growth of almost 20 percent.
Less certain, however, is how investors should value those profits with price-to-earnings estimates. The struggle to do so could lead to more stock market volatility.
The valuations issue has gained fresh prominence for market strategists amid a rise in interest rates and bond yields, along with concerns about inflation increasing.
Those factors, including a yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note (US10YT=RR) that is approaching 3 percent, has prompted investors to rethink how to price stocks, which have become more expensive as the nearly nine-year bull market has aged.
Indeed, some investors are weighing whether equities deserve lower valuations.
""It’s a topic that’s got to be in the front of a lot of asset managers' minds right now: What level is this market a really good buy again?,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.
""We are going to get good earnings coming through,"" Paulsen said. ""The problem is we are going to lose the value on those earnings.""
A test for equity valuations could come with next Friday's U.S. employment report for February. Last month's report revealed surprising wage gains that sparked concerns of inflation, in turn setting off a jump in yields and a drop in stocks.
Stocks are commonly valued by comparing their price to their estimated profits over the next year, known as the price-to-earnings, or P/E, ratio.
“Interest rates set the discount for what you want to value companies at and in general with higher interest rates you are going to see lower P/Es as fair value,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""You are going to be less willing to pay higher multiples on stocks where your discount rate continues to go up.""
VOLATILITY
The P/E ratio on the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) had climbed to 18.6 times by the end of January, the highest level in about 15 years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream, as stocks climbed to all-time peaks.
That was just before the market plunged at the start of February, dropping 10 percent and confirming a correction, and in turn lowering the P/E ratio to 17 times earnings estimates.
Valuations hovered around that level at the end of a turbulent week. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent on Friday, recovering some losses from Thursday, when U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for tariffs on steel and aluminum, raising concern about higher prices and a trade war. (N)
""A lot of the volatility that has occurred and a bit of the repricing of financial assets, stocks in particular, is a result of there (being) a little bit of uncertainty as to what we should use as that discount rate,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.
Half of the S&P 500's returns last year stemmed from the P/E going up - investors willing to pay more for future earnings - helped by optimism about the global economy, according to Arone, but people’s willingness to ""pay even more for those earnings is probably beginning to fade.""
The good news for stock investors is that S&P 500 earnings are expected to jump 19.2 percent in 2018, the biggest increase since a 40.3 percent rise in 2010, as the United States emerged from the financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
An examination of the six other years in which S&P 500 earnings growth topped 15 percent, along with increasing 10-year Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, found that P/E multiples shrank in all but one year, but the index still managed gains, according to Keith Lerner, chief market strategist with SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
Lerner expects the stock market will be able to maintain a forward P/E of around 16 times. That is cheaper than current levels, but above the S&P 500's long-term average of 15 times, according to Datastream.
According to a Reuters poll of market strategists this week, stocks will rack up a gain of more than 8 percent for the year, despite the recent correction.
""We are not relying on multiple expansion. In fact, if rates continue to rise like this, we are looking at probably a little bit more of a contraction scenario,"" said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors. ""But this will be offset by strong (earnings) growth."" 
But Paulsen said he believed stocks may be overpriced and that Leuthold recently reduced U.S. equity exposure in its main funds. Among his concerns was whether inflation is about to rise more sharply.
“We have given birth to a whole new generation of investors that have rarely seen inflation at even 3 percent,” Paulsen said.

""If you are going to generate some negative fallout from additional growth, however much longer this recovery lasts, that creates a very different environment.""

541,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 03:44AM ET</span>","Australia watchdog takes Rio Tinto, executives to court over Mozambique deal","By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's corporate watchdog said on Friday it has launched court action against miner  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO) and two former executives for misleading investors about the coal reserves it reported in a $4 billion acquisition in Mozambique.
The Australian Securities and Investments Commission said the company, its former Chief Executive Tom Albanese and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott had made deceptive statements in their 2011 annual report, published in 2012.
""ASIC alleges that RTL (Rio Tinto Ltd) engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct by publishing statements in the 2011 annual report, signed by Mr Albanese and Mr Elliott, misrepresenting the reserves and resources of RTCM (Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique),"" the commission said in a statement. 
""We will respond once we have had an opportunity to consider the allegations in full,"" Rio Tinto said in an emailed statement.
Rio shares were down 0.8 percent at 3,748 pence in early trade in London.
The company has denied any wrongdoing in a similar case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Rio Tinto now faces court cases in the United States and Australia over its disastrous acquisition of Riversdale in Mozambique, with the U.S. SEC having charged the company, Albanese and Elliott with fraud.
""The outcomes of these matters, and associated class actions that have been commenced on behalf of securities holders, remain uncertain, but they could ultimately expose the Group to material financial cost,"" Rio Tinto said in its 2017 annual report released on Friday.
ASIC said it is asking the court to declare that Rio Tinto broke the Corporations Act, is seeking monetary penalties against Albanese and Elliott and is asking the court to bar them from managing corporations ""for such periods as the court thinks fit"".
The commission is continuing investigations into the circumstances surrounding the impairment of the Mozambique coal assets, it said, declining to comment further.
Rio Tinto bought Riversdale for $4 billion in 2011, wrote off about $3.5 billion of its value and sacked Albanese and other executives involved in the deal in 2013. 
The Mozambique writedown followed hefty writedowns on a previous acquisition.
The SEC alleges that the company and executives inflated the value of coal assets in Mozambique and concealed critical information while tapping the market for billions of dollars.
The company, Albanese and Elliott have all said they would vigorously defend themselves against the allegations. 
Rio Tinto has already reached a settlement with Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, agreeing to pay a fine of 27 million pounds ($36 million) for breaching accounting rules in connection with the Mozambique assets.

""The investment in 2011 of $4 billion in Mozambique in what ultimately turned out to be inferior quality coal assets was undoubtedly a low point during my tenure,"" outgoing Chairman Jan du Plessis said on Friday in his final annual report with the company.

Yasuyuki Yoshinaga will step down as president and be replaced by Corporate Executive Vice President Tomomi Nakamura after approval at a shareholders' meeting in June, the company said. 
Subaru also announced three board members will be replaced. The move was reported earlier by the Nikkei.
Yoshinaga, however, will retain his role as chief executive and will become chairman of the company. The retiring board members are also set to retain some roles with the company, with the previous chairman of the board to be appointed as special adviser. 
The Japanese automaker revealed in October that uncertified staff had carried out final tests of new cars for the domestic market for decades. The faulty inspections violated transport ministry norms and eventually led to the recall of 395,000 vehicles.
""I want to draw a line under the final inspection issue,"" Yoshinaga told reporters on Friday.
In December, the company's shares fell to their lowest since July 2016 after it said it was looking into whether mileage readings may have been falsified during final checks.

Japan's manufacturing industry was hit by several scandals last year. Nissan Motor (T:7201) admitted to incorrect final inspection procedures, while Kobe Steel (T:5406), Mitsubishi Materials Corp (T:5711) and Toray Industries (T:3402) - all key suppliers of products to global manufacturers - admitted to product data fabrication.

SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors (N:GM) saw its South Korean vehicle sales tumble by almost half in February, as consumers took fright at its decision to slash production and restructure its loss-making operations in the country. 
Although GM's presence in the South Korean market is small with most cars made there destined for export, the slide in sales highlights uncertainty hanging over its operations after the automaker said it would shut one plant and decide the fate of three others in the coming weeks.
Its South Korean retail sales dropped 48 percent to just 5,804 in February, while wholesale sales of cars for export slid 9 percent to just over 30,000 vehicles.
""Consumers appear to be concerned about everyday-life repercussions of owning a GM vehicle if its presence shrinks in South Korea, especially weaker after-service,"" said Esther Yim, an analyst at Samsung (KS:005930) Securities.
The U.S. automaker is currently seeking concessions on wages from an angry labor union and wants financial support from the South Korean government which is set to conduct due diligence on what it has called the automaker's ""opaque"" management in the country.
GM Korea likely made an operating loss of 800 billion won ($740 million) last year, a fourth consecutive year of losses since the Chevy brand was pulled from Europe in 2013, South Korea's financial regulator said this week.
GM only has 7 percent of the South Korean market, trailing far behind South Korea's two biggest automakers,  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) and Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270), which have a combined share of 68 percent. 
South Korean auto sales in February were also hit by two less business days in the month due to Lunar New Year holidays with Hyundai and Kia both seeing their domestic retail sales drop 5.5 percent. Even so, they are expected to have captured some domestic market share at GM Korea's expense, analysts said.

546,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 10:30PM ET</span>",Toyota Says Trump's Tariffs to `Adversely Impact' Automakers,"(Bloomberg) -- The auto industry is warning that U.S. sales declines, which have become routine over the past year, may continue thanks to the tariffs President Donald Trump plans to slap on steel and aluminum imports.
Toyota Motor Corp., which plans to build a new $1.6 billion factory in Alabama with Mazda Motor Corp., said the administration’s decision will “adversely impact” auto companies by raising costs and prices of cars and trucks sold in the U.S. That’s even as more than 90 percent of the steel Asia’s biggest carmaker needs in the U.S. is from the country.
Trade groups representing automakers including General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). and Toyota, plus parts suppliers like Robert Bosch GmbH, tried to warn the Trump administration of unintended consequences before the president said Thursday he plans to order tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum. Asian automakers’ shares declined while U.S. carmakers -- already slipping because of weak February sales -- extended their drop after Trump’s comments.
“These proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports couldn’t come at a worse time,” said Cody Lusk, president of the American International Automobile Dealers Association. “Auto sales have flattened in recent months, and manufacturers are not prepared to absorb a sharp increase in the cost to build cars and trucks in America.”
Honda Motor Co., which declined to comment on the administration’s move, led the drop in shares of Asian carmakers. Following is a table showing how much the shares declined Friday.
Five of the six biggest car manufacturers on Thursday posted lower February U.S. deliveries than a year ago. GM shares slumped 4 percent in New York, while Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. dropped 3 percent and Fiat Chrysler fell 2.8 percent.
The average car includes about $830 of steel and $400 of aluminum, according to a Feb. 26 analysis by Colin Langan, an analyst with UBS.
He projected that Ford’s raw material costs were already going to rise by $1 billion this year, and said Thursday that the tariffs would add another $300 million. GM’s raw material costs, already seen climbing $800 million, would rise an additional $200 million from the import measures. Langan characterized rising raw material costs as “manageable.”
Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist for researcher Cox Automotive, estimates the tariffs Trump proposed would add about $200 to the total price of a vehicle.
“It’s unfortunate because it comes at a time when there are already fears about inflation,” he said in an interview. “This is only going to add fuel to that fire.”
Toyota said it buys sheet steel from United Steel Steel Corp., ArcelorMittal and AK Steel Holding Corp., and sheet aluminum from Arconic Inc., Novelis Corp. and a venture of Constellium NV and UACJ Corp.
Carmakers and suppliers getting most of their aluminum and steel from U.S. producers may not shield them from rising costs, said Kristin Dziczek, director of the industry, labor and economics group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. That’s because those producers also use imported material, which they process into other steel or aluminum products, she said.

While the Trump administration did the auto industry a favor by cutting taxes late last year, the tariffs have the potential to “nullify many of the benefits” by boosting vehicle prices, said John Bozzella, president of the Association of Global Automakers. The group represents companies including Japan’s Toyota, Germany’s Bosch and South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co.
“Investments earmarked for new products and plants will instead be funneled to pay for rising steel and aluminum prices used in existing products and facilities,” Bozzella said in a statement released Wednesday.
Global Automakers said that President George W. Bush’s 2002 steel tariffs cost the economy 200,000 jobs, including 30,000 in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Even without the new tariffs, rising metal prices have been a problem for Ford. The second-largest U.S. automaker said in January that 2018 would be a “bad year” as costs surge. The price of steel, Ford’s biggest commodity purchase, has jumped about 33 percent since the start of last year. Aluminum, used for the bodies of F-Series pickups, is up more than a quarter.
“Certainly, this is going to be a negative for the vehicle market,” Chesbrough said. “At some point, it’s going to put vehicles just out of reach for some buyers and it’s going to cause some kind of pullback in the market.”

Overnight, the S&P 500 slumped 1.33%, while the Dow also lost 1.7%.
The U.S. tariffs would raise steel and aluminum’s import prices, as Trump planned to slap a 25% duty on steel and 10% on aluminum. The tariffs are expected to be implemented broadly, without targeting any specific countries. An official announcement is expected sometime next week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets slid further and the U.S. dollar dropped to its lowest in more than two years against the yen on Friday as concern over a global trade war added to investor uncertainties about rising inflation and the outlook for U.S. interest rates.
President Donald Trump's pledge on Thursday to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports raised the prospect of a global trade war that could prove damaging to a healthy U.S. economy that is poised to deliver record corporate earnings.
The rout in risk assets knocked the dollar from multi-week highs as the specter of protectionism spurred fear of retaliation by other nations, which would be negative for the greenback.

Asian steelmakers were hit hard, with South Korea's Posco down 3.3 percent and Japan's Nippon Steel off 3.8 percent. Toyota Motor shares slid 2.4 percent after it said tariffs would substantially raise production costs and the price of cars and trucks sold in America.
Trump's move could herald the tough actions on trade he had promised during the electoral campaign as a way to incentivize companies to just ""buy American, hire American,"" said John Doyle, vice president of dealing and trading at Tempus Inc. in Washington.
""The U.S. dollar may face some scrutiny and as a result struggle to hold on to recent gains,"" Doyle said. ""It is the type of scenario that is unprecedented, thus wild swings may occur as this is digested and analyzed the next few days.""
Volatility will continue until investors get some clarity on the path of U.S. interest rates, inflation, global trade policy and the international response, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.
""Investors do not like uncertain outcomes, they just don't,"" Arone said. ""If we could just eliminate some of this noise, there's a really healthy underlying stock market.""

549,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 02, 2018 03:44AM ET</span>","Asia fears trade war after Trump plans hefty steel, aluminum tariffs","By Jane Chung and Tom Westbrook
SEOUL/SYDNEY (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on steel and aluminum risk retaliation from other economies and could cost jobs, Australia's trade minister said on Friday, while China predicted harm to trade if other countries follow the example of the United States.
Fears of an escalating trade war roiled Asian markets, hitting the share prices of steelmakers and manufacturers supplying U.S. markets particularly hard. 
U.S. stock futures pointed to a steady start on Friday after a sharp fall following Trump's Thursday announcement. 
Trump said the duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum would be formally announced next week, although White House officials later said some details still needed to be ironed out.
""The imposition of a tariff like this will do nothing other than distort trade and ultimately, we believe, will lead to a loss of jobs,"" Australian trade minister Steven Ciobo told reporters in Sydney.
""My concern remains that on the back of actions like this we could see retaliatory measures that are put in place by other major economies. That is in no-one's interest.""
GRAPHIC: http://reut.rs/2F4MJ6T
Australia, which has championed the free-trade Trans Pacific Partnership that Trump pulled the United States out of, has sought an exemption for its steel and aluminum exports to the United States, Ciobo added.
""All countries steel and aluminum industries are facing difficulties,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing in Beijing. 
""China urges the United States to show restraint in using protective trade measures, respect multilateral trade rules, and make a positive contribution to international trade order."" 
Steel has become a key focus for Trump, who pledged to restore the U.S. industry and punish what he sees as unfair trade practices, particularly by China.
Although China only accounts for 2 percent of U.S. steel imports, its massive industry expansion has helped produce a global glut of steel that has driven down prices.
""The impact on China is not big,” said Li Xinchuang, vice secretary-general of the China Iron and Steel Association. ""Nothing can be done about Trump. We are already numb to him.""
South Korea, the third-largest steel exporter to the United States after Canada and Brazil, said it will keep talking to U.S. officials until Washington's plans for tariffs are finalised. 
""For us, the worst case scenario was a 54 percent tariff,"" said a South Korean trade ministry official who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.
Nonetheless, if Trump pursues his proposal for a 25 percent global steel tariff, ""that will still affect our steel exports to the U.S,"" the official added.
Canada, Brazil and the EU said they would look to take action over the tariffs.
NATIONAL SECURITY?
Moody's Investors Service noted that steel and aluminum are not a major economic factor even for big Asian exporters, typically accounting for less than 1 percent of gross domestic product or exports.
Asian steelmakers, however, do worry U.S. tariffs could result in their domestic markets becoming flooded with steel products that have nowhere else to go. 
“We are concerned about how other exporters react, what will happen with steel that cannot be sold to the U.S.,” Vikrom Wacharakrup, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries' iron and steel industry group, told Reuters. Thailand exports steel mainly to Asia but also the United States.
The Trump administration also cited national security interests for its action, saying the United States needs domestic supplies for its tanks and warships. 
Contrary to the action announced by Trump on Thursday, the Department of Defense had recommended targeted steel tariffs and a delay in aluminum duties. 
""We continue to seek clarification,"" said Japanese Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko. ""I don’t think exports of steel and aluminum from Japan, which is a U.S. ally, damages U.S. national security in any way, and we would like to explain that to the U.S.""
India also raised concerns about the use of the U.S. national security interest provisions, under what is known as a Section 232 investigation.
""We have only 2 percent of our exports to U.S. so no immediate dent, but validity of Section 232 is stretched to be used as a tariff barrier,"" India's Steel Secretary Aruna Sharma told Reuters. 
Trump believes the tariffs will safeguard American jobs but many economists say the impact of price increases for consumers of steel and aluminum, such as the auto and oil industries, will be to destroy more jobs than they create.
Japan's Toyota Motor Corp said the tariffs would substantially raise costs and therefore prices of cars and trucks sold in the United States.
Asian share markets extended Thursday's rout on Wall Street. Japan's benchmark Nikkei Index dropped 2.5 percent.
Asian steelmakers suffered, with South Korea's POSCO and Japan's Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp both down more than 3 percent.
""The world stands on the brink of a trade war as Donald Trump announces severe tariffs on steel and aluminum - forget the yield curve - this is how recessions start,"" said Robert Carnell, head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING in Singapore.

""Trade is just about the only thing economists are agreed on - more is better,"" he said.

550,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>",Trump's Tariffs Hammer Metals Exporters in Japan and South Korea,"(Bloomberg) -- Steel producers in South Korea and Japan are getting hammered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to hike tariffs on imports and the risk of a global tit-for-tat trade war.
Mills in South Korea, the third-biggest supplier of steel to the U.S., tumbled as trading resumed after a holiday. Posco slid 3.3 percent while Hyundai Steel Co. was 3 percent lower in Seoul. Japanese producers also continued the sell-off that began on Thursday as news of the tariffs broke, with Kobe Steel Ltd. losing 3.4 percent and Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. sliding 3.9 percent.
Trump said the U.S. will impose tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum for “a long period of time,” and he expects to sign a formal order next week. While he has made no secret of his intention to protect American interests against foreign markets, the threat that other nations will retaliate is prompting concern that key export markets will be shut off to producers around the world.
The planned tariffs raise “risks of an all-out trade war, which could dampen economic growth and weigh on the sector,” Australia & New Zealand Banking Group said in note.
Much of Trump’s protectionist agenda is directed at China, but the Asian nation isn’t a major exporter of steel to the U.S. That may explain why the reaction in Chinese steel stocks may be less pronounced when they start trading. The listed units China’s Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. and Hesteel Co., its two-biggest mills, dropped 0.7 percent and 1.3 percent respectively on Thursday.
Although China has figured large in Trump’s protectionist rhetoric, it accounts for just 2 percent of U.S. imports, and its shipments generally are falling as robust domestic growth soaks up metal and the government cuts capacity as part of a drive to clean up the environment.
The impact is potentially greater for China’s aluminum industry, the fourth-biggest supplier to the U.S. China Hongqiao Group and Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., its two biggest producers, fell more than 1.8 percent in intraday trading on Thursday.
The U.S. took 14 percent of China’s aluminum exports last year, as the Asian nation’s overseas shipments and production both rose to a record.

552,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 08:32PM ET</span>",Chipotle investors see low-hanging fruit for new CEO,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc's (N:CMG) incoming Chief Executive Brian Niccol has some low-hanging fruit to pluck when he takes the helm at the troubled U.S. burrito seller on Monday, investors told Reuters.
The former Taco Bell CEO is tasked with turning around the chain, which has struggled to return to red-hot growth after a sales and reputation-crushing string of food safety lapses in late 2015. 
Its annual revenues are only slightly higher than pre-crisis levels, even after it added hundreds of new restaurants and gave away millions of dollars in free and discounted food. 
""They definitely need to get the customer back on board,"" said Josh Blechman, director of capital markets at Exponential ETFs, which on Feb. 28 had 2,500 Chipotle shares in a portfolio that tracks American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI).
The chain's stock closed at $313.26 on Thursday, off nearly 60 percent from its all-time high in July 2015. 
Chipotle's ACSI was 83 in 2015, fell to 78 in 2016 and recovered slightly to 79 last year. 
Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold declined to comment for this article, saying the company would not speculate about what moves Niccol will make.
Chipotle has shuffled executives, revamped its board and shuttered underperforming ShopHouse Asian Kitchen and Tasty Made restaurants since activist investor William Ackman became its single largest shareholder with a 10 percent stake in September 2016.
Analysts say Niccol, known for his menu and marketing prowess, could quickly refresh Chipotle's limited menu by, for instance, adding quesadillas, nachos or breakfast, and tap his professional network to strengthen its ranks. 
Chipotle, which used its ""Food with Integrity"" tagline to build a following, disappointed investors in September 2016 when it reinstated marketing chief Mark Crumpacker months after he was charged with multiple counts of cocaine possession.
Crumpacker pleaded guilty to cocaine possession in January 2017. Prosecutors agreed to dismiss his case if he got treatment for a year and stayed out of trouble.
Reinstating Crumpacker was ""so off brand,"" said Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at San Francisco's Golden Gate University.
""Crumpacker may have to be replaced,"" said Ivan Feinseth, who oversees investment strategy and research at Tigress Financial Partners in New York City. Tigress funds do not own Chipotle shares, but Feinseth said he is looking to buy on a dip. 
The Denver-based Chipotle has been remotely managed since the December 2016 departure of co-CEO Monty Moran. Niccol will be based at headquarters, Arnold said. 
Steve Ells, Chipotle's founder, chairman and outgoing CEO, and Crumpacker work from Manhattan. Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung is based in Chicago.
""If you're going to build a team, the team has got to be there,"" Feinseth said.

""That's something they can look into. That's low-hanging fruit,"" Blechman said.

553,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 10:28PM ET</span>",Female-led investor group to buy Weinstein Co assets,"By Lisa Richwine and Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - A former Obama administration official on Thursday reached a deal to purchase assets of The Weinstein Company and said she will use a majority-female board to rebuild the Hollywood studio tarnished by sexual misconduct allegations. 
Former Small Business Administration chief Maria Contreras-Sweet plans to launch a new company, save about 150 jobs, protect the small companies that are owed money, and create a victims' compensation fund that will supplement existing insurance coverage for those who have been harmed, she said in a statement.
""This next step represents the best possible pathway to support victims and protect employees,"" Contreras-Sweet said.
The Weinstein Company's board of directors confirmed it had reached a deal with Contreras-Sweet and supermarket billionaire Ron Burkle.
The studio nearly went bankrupt after more than 70 women accused co-founder Harvey Weinstein, then one of Hollywood's most influential men, of sexual misconduct including rape. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.
The company last month was close to inking a deal for more than $500 million to be taken over by investors led by Contreras-Sweet and Burkle.
But New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman upended the negotiations on Feb. 11 by filing a suit against the Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein and his brother, Bob, alleging that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed employees and the company failed to respond. The company early this week said it planned to file for bankruptcy.
On Thursday evening, Contreras-Sweet, the Weinstein Co and Schneiderman said they had worked together to bring about the deal. In a statement, Schneiderman said he had received commitments that a well-funded victims compensation fund would be created, that new policies would protect employees in the new company and that ""bad actors"" would not be unjustly rewarded.
He said he would ensure the final deal honored the agreed terms and that the lawsuit would remain active in the mean time.
A person familiar with the matter said the parties hammered out the deal in a conference room in Schneiderman's office on Thursday evening. The compensation fund will be $80-90 million, the person said.
Launched in October 2005, the studio produced and distributed critically acclaimed hits including ""The King's Speech"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Harvey Weinstein was known as the leading tastemaker for independent film and a master at Academy Awards campaigns.
His company also produced television series including the long-running fashion competition show ""Project Runway.""
When the allegations against Harvey Weinstein became public, the company's board fired him, and Hollywood heavyweights distanced themselves from the studio.

Since then, similar allegations have been leveled against many powerful men in business, politics and entertainment, and the #MeToo movement of victims has emerged, using social media to share their stories of harassment and abuse.

CEO James Debney, on a conference call with investors to discuss earnings, briefly addressed the Feb. 14 attack at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which has sparked a wave of student protests and calls for gun control legislation. 
Company officials ""share the nation's grief"" over the shooting while reaffirming their support of firearms rights, he said. 
Debney said that following the shooting, he heard reports of ""increased foot traffic"" to firearms retailers ""leading to some increased sales.""
In the past, fears of gun restrictions have sometimes led to increases in gun sales after mass shootings. 
Shares of American Outdoor fell 10 percent in after-hours trading after the company reported earnings.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Georgia state legislators on Thursday struck down what would have been a lucrative tax exemption for hometown carrier Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), after vowing to punish the airline for ending its relationship with the National Rifle Association.
Led by a Republican majority, state lawmakers passed a tax bill that excludes a jet fuel tax exemption designed to benefit Delta, the state's largest private employer. It was the most significant blowback yet after the carrier said last week it was cutting ties with the NRA following a Florida school massacre.
Delta said it was ending a discount program for NRA members and had asked the gun rights group to remove its information from the group's website after the Feb. 14 slaying of 17 students and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland. The killings reignited the long-running U.S. debate over gun ownership laws
Delta did not respond to a request on Thursday for comment about the Georgia tax bill. In a statement on Saturday, the carrier said it supports the Second Amendment, which grants Americans the right to bear arms, and that it wished to stay neutral in the emotionally charged debate.
Georgia Republicans had criticized the airline's move to cut its ties to the NRA. They were led by Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, president of the state senate, who vowed to kill any tax legislation that benefited Delta. The bill that passed the Georgia House of Representatives and Senate on Thursday had previously included tax exemption language that had been projected to save Delta some $40 million a year in jet fuel tax. 
Georgia Governor Nathan Deal had on Wednesday criticized the decision to exclude the exemption as ""the type of antics that tend to plague election years,"" but said he would still sign the bill after it passed. 

Cagle is running to succeed Deal in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race. Deal said he remained committed to eliminating Georgia's sales tax on jet fuel, ""which is non-negotiable.""

558,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 05:52PM ET</span>",Nasdaq sues rival IEX Group over patent infringement,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) on Thursday filed a patent infringement lawsuit against rival IEX Group, accusing the newest U.S. exchange operator of copying several core aspects of its electronic trading platform.
The lawsuit seeks to stop IEX, which operates the Investors Exchange and was featured in author Michael Lewis's book ""Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,"" from continuing to use the technology without a license. The exchange is also seeking an unspecified amount of compensation for what it said was IEX's unauthorized use of its intellectual property.
Nasdaq, founded in 1971, has grown to be one of the world's largest exchange operators and suppliers of exchange technology. It accused IEX of violating seven of its patents related to four exchange processes, which it said represented millions of dollars in investment. 
IEX was founded in 2012 and launched its first trading platform, an alternative trading system, in 2013, touting its market as a fairer place for investors to trade than the existing exchanges.
The New York-based company launched as a full-fledged stock exchange in August 2016 after getting regulatory approval despite opposition from Nasdaq and some other exchanges to one of the main aspects of its exchange design, which involves slowing down stock orders, similar to a speed bump.
IEX has said that its ""speed-bump"" helps prevent predatory trading practices. Other exchanges initially opposed the speed bump, but some later adopted or proposed versions of their own. NYSE's speed-bump is nearly identical to IEX's. 
IEX now plans to compete against Nasdaq and Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) New York Stock Exchange for corporate listings.
""Similar to our exchange application process, this is yet another attempt by Nasdaq to obstruct an innovative new competitor,"" IEX spokesman Gerald Lam said of the lawsuit. 
The seven patents Nasdaq has accused IEX of infringing are related to the closing auction processes for stocks listed on the exchange, so-called multi-parallel order processing, matching engine performance, and data feed optimizations.
Nasdaq said that in 2012 and 2013, IEX hired at least four technology employees from Nasdaq to help build IEX's trading platform who would have been familiar with the intellectual property that is the focus of the lawsuit.
Nasdaq also said IEX has admitted in public filings that its closing auction process was ""designed based on extensive review"" of Nasdaq's process.
""These seven patents cover important innovations that we, and our customers, rely on for reliability, scalability, and transparency,"" Nasdaq's General Counsel Edward Knight said in a statement.
The lawsuit, Nasdaq v. IEX Group, Inc, was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

1. The Loonie In Focus As Canada Releases GDP 
Economists forecast Canada’s economic growth as measured by GDP grew 0.4% in the fourth quarter and 2% at an annualized pace. While month-on-month GDP is expected to have to have risen by 0.1% in December.
Traders are eager for an update on Canada’s economy after signs of a slowdown prevailed in recent weeks, denting the prospect of a faster pace of rate hikes.
TD Securities recently said it expects the Bank of Canada to raise rates only twice in 2018, with the next hike expected as late as July, warning that the economy “has clearly cooled” and that the medium-term economic outlook is facing “several domestic headwinds.”
Ahead of the data USD/CAD rose 0.02% to C$1.2835.
2. UK Prime Minister May Takes To The Brexit Stage; Construction Data Eyed
UK Prime Minister, Theresa May is set to deliver a speech Friday, outlining a plan for a new post-Brexit relationship with the EU. Pressure is mounting on May to rethink her so-called redlines – outlined in her 2016 Tory conference speech – which took the option of Britain remaining in the customs union and single market post-Brexit off the table.
The PM’s upcoming speech comes amid fresh fears that UK-EU Brexit talks are set to reach yet another impasse after May rejected the EU’s proposal of a “common regulatory area.”
UK construction data , meanwhile, could offer a much needed distraction for the pound. Economists’ forecasts UK construction purchasing managers' index rose to a reading of 50.5 in February from the 50.2 print a month ago.
The purchasing managers index (PMI) figures are given as a number between 0 and 100. Anything above 50 signals growth, while anything below indicates a contraction in activity. A reading of 50.5 would indicate that the sector is close to contracting.
GBP/USD rose 0.11% to $1.3775.
3. Baker Hughes Rig Count to Add To Rising US Output Fears?
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by one to 799, the highest level since April 2, 2015.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures settled lower on Thursday as recent data showing US oil producers continued to ramp up output offset bullish data showing crude output from OPEC fell to a 10-month low in February. The fall in the group’s output was mainly drive by production declines in Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)."

565,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo Probes Widen as Fed Says Sanctions Will Be Lasting,"(Bloomberg) --  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co.’s legal and regulatory struggles expanded to previously untarnished businesses Thursday as the company revealed new allegations of improper sales practices. The Federal Reserve vowed to keep unprecedented sanctions in place for a “significant period.”
The bank, still trying to steady itself from a bogus-account scandal that took down former Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, said government agencies had inquired about improprieties in the wealth-management business related to 401(k) rollovers and other products. The lender is also responding to queries from government agencies into its foreign-exchange business, the company said in a regulatory filing.

Wells Fargo has yet to put behind it 18 months of scandal in its retail-banking business, where employees under pressure to meet aggressive sales goals may have opened millions of accounts in customers’ names without permission. The bank has said it’s facing at least three major probes, including one by the U.S. Department of Justice. Last month, the Fed put in place sanctions preventing the bank from getting any bigger until it fixes its problems.
“We will not lightly lift” that restriction, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told lawmakers at a Senate Banking Committee hearing Thursday, responding to Senator Elizabeth Warren’s call for the agency to stand firm. Wells Fargo will probably be subject to the sanctions for a “significant period,” Powell said.
Shares of the company fell 1.6 percent to $57.49 at 2:30 p.m. in New York trading, extending this year’s decline to 5.4 percent.
‘Inappropriate Referrals’
The wealth-management review, which began in response to inquiries by federal government agencies, “is assessing whether there have been inappropriate referrals or recommendations” given to 401(k) plan participants and customers seeking alternative investments, the bank said in the filing. Wells Fargo also said that the probe is examining referrals given to brokerage clients to use services provided by its investment and fiduciary-services business, which is a part of the wealth-management division run by Jonathan Weiss.
CEO Tim Sloan said in a Feb. 12 interview with Bloomberg that the bank hadn’t uncovered issues similar to the consumer bank scandal in the wealth-management unit. “I’m not going to provide any absolute guarantee -- ever, ever -- that we’re ever not going to find an issue in any of our businesses,” Sloan said.
‘Incorrect Fees’
The company is conducting a separate review of “incorrect fees” charged to customers’ fiduciary and custody accounts, according to Thursday’s filing, which said outside consultants are trying to determine how it miscalculated the value of certain assets. Wells Fargo said the review is in its “preliminary stages” and centered around non-publicly traded assets.
The foreign-exchange review follows the bank’s disclosure late last year that four currency traders left the firm over a transaction conducted for a client. The bank said its “leadership took steps to hold accountable the individuals who were involved.”
Adding to the list of probes and reviews are allegations by a former Wells Fargo financial-crimes investigator who said in a complaint filed Wednesday that the bank improperly follows up on allegations of fraud in customer accounts.
Matthew Valles, who worked at the bank until January, said that instead of investigating potential fraud, the bank would close the accounts, leaving some customers on the hook for unauthorized withdrawals, according to a copy of the complaint filed in Multnomah County circuit court in Oregon.
“We take seriously the concerns of current and former team members, and we investigate them thoroughly,” Jim Seitz, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said in an emailed statement. “Wells Fargo is reviewing the legal complaint that was filed on Wednesday afternoon.”"
566,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Investment Chill Grips Canada Amid Oil Woes and Trump Threats,"(Bloomberg) -- More companies are saying no thanks to investing in Canada.
The world’s 10th largest economy is still grappling with the effects of the oil-price crash as its southern neighbor lures work away with tax cuts and protectionist threats. Canada’s struggle to boost investment in this environment threatens both its maturing expansion, which relies heavily on spending by indebted consumers, and its long-term competitiveness.
“Uncertainty isn’t good for investment and uncertainty is high,” Royal Bank of Canada senior economist Nathan Janzen said by telephone from Toronto. “The concern with business investment is always more what it means for growth this year, the year after that, in terms of potentially slower productivity.”
Energy companies are chopping their budgets even as global oil prices climb back from a crash, and may lose about C$16 billion ($12.4 billion) of revenue this year because of discounts on Alberta’s heavy crude -- a problem blamed on a lack of pipeline space. Foreign direct investment in Canada, meanwhile, has fallen to the lowest since 2010.
Another unknown for investment prospects is how companies are dealing with production constraints. As firms bump up against production capacity at this high point in the economic cycle, you’d expect capital expenditure intentions to be widespread across industries. Yet capex is expected to increase just 0.8 percent even with capacity utilization hitting a 10-year high of 85 percent. 
It’s possible companies are increasingly turning to the labor market to address excess demand, which would explain Canada’s string of red-hot jobs reports last year. That preference could further constrain business investment.
Taxes and Trade
Then there Donald Trump. The U.S. president has slashed corporate taxes, is threatening to walk away from the North American Free Trade Agreement and plans to impose hefty tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum.
Businesses were pressing the government to address these challenges, but Finance Minister Bill Morneau declined to cut taxes in his budget this week. He did, however, acknowledge the changing trade landscape Thursday, given Canada relies on the U.S. for three-quarters of its exports.
“We do recognize that as a result of the discussions around Nafta, there are some businesses that are concerned about their opportunities to invest,” Morneau said after a post-budget speech in Toronto. “It will be important for us to maintain our focus on Nafta to make sure we have a strong agreement that can work for all three countries.”
Fourth-quarter gross domestic product will be released Friday and most economists say it’s unlikely to show a major jolt to business spending. The Bank of Montreal’s forecast for economic growth of 2.2 percent this year faces some “downside risk” because of investment weakness, according to senior economist Robert Kavcic.
“There isn’t a lot of appetite for net new investment at this point,” Kavcic said by phone Thursday. “I would really point to the impact of the oil shock because that was dramatic -- it has spread out through the Canadian economy.”"
567,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Your Money: You can do better financially by doing good,"By Chris Taylor
NEW YORK (Reuters) - It stands to reason that getting involved in your community helps others. But what if it helped your own bottom line, as well?
That is the finding of a new survey from financial giant MassMutual, which discovered that nearly half of the Americans surveyed in the 2018 Financial Wellness and Community Involvement Study believe that community involvement helped their own pocketbooks - not just their emotions or their sense of belonging, but their actual money.
Community can mean different things to different people, but wherever you happen to sink your roots, being connected to others appears to improve financial behaviors and decision-making. To wit, the MassMutual survey found that those who are community-minded are better at tracking their spending: 80 percent do it every month, compared with 61 percent of people who are not involved in the community.
They are also superior at putting money in an emergency fund every month (45 percent versus 30 percent), measuring their financial progress (56 percent versus 36 percent), and directing money into retirement savings (45 percent versus 29 percent).
Beside these enhanced money behaviors, there are also concrete ways that community involvement can power-boost your career and finances:
* It helps you get a job.
In one study by the Corporation for National and Community Service, researchers found that volunteering led to 27 percent higher odds of employment. And for those without a high school degree, it actually boosts your odds of finding work by an astonishing 51 percent.
* It provides a stream of new leads and business opportunities. 
When 47-year-old Santa Monica financial planner Mitchell Kraus got involved with his local Rotary Club around 10 years ago, he found that the usual networking meet-and-greets did not lead to much. 
But when he jumped into the club’s volunteer activities – from planting greenery to reading books to local elementary schools – he experienced a surprising byproduct: He started getting business referrals left and right.
Krause said he has had more than two dozen clients sent his way over the past decade by other attorneys and accountants in the club who volunteered right alongside him. “Opportunities started to open up when people saw I wasn’t just there to get business, but to give back to the community,” Kraus says.
* It acts as an informal social safety net.
If you are down on your luck, it helps if you have circles of supporters to turn to – whether that happens to be your cousins, your coworkers, or fellow parishioners. 
In the MassMutual survey, more than half said they have supported others in their community during periods of financial stress. The reverse is also true: A quarter of people say their communities have kept them financially afloat, when they needed help the most.
* It helps you make better financial decisions.
If you are a butcher or a baker, you might not know a whole lot about what percentage to save, in what accounts to put that money, or what specific investments to consider. But if you were a member of Mitchell Kraus’ Rotary Club -- and you find yourself surrounded by a group of financial planners, accountants and attorneys who like you and want you to succeed – that is a lot of financial advice you can tap.
Not only are those resources available to you, but you are likely modeling the financial habits of the successful people who surround you. That’s a financial win-win.

569,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 05:48PM ET</span>","GM, rivals chase luxury pickups' fat margins as U.S. market dips","By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) on Thursday unveiled a revamped luxury pickup truck, intensifying the battle among Detroit's Big Three automakers for fat profits at the top end of a highly lucrative segment even as overall U.S. new vehicle sales decline.
That battle will be fought in truck-heavy states like Texas, where consumers aspire to luxury pickup trucks more than luxury car brands such as  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz and BMW (DE:BMWG). 
""The whole (luxury truck) segment is going to be exceptionally competitive for at least the next 24 months, because Ford and  Fiat  Chrysler will not take this lying down,"" IHS Markit auto analyst Tom Libby said of GM unit GMC's new Sierra Denali. 
Detroit's automakers dominate the U.S. pickup truck market.
""There has been some softness in the (overall) market, but the market for these trucks is still very strong,"" GM's global product development chief Mark Reuss said at the event on Thursday. 
Unlike some past GMC vehicles, the new 2019 Sierra Denali pickup, a premium version of the standard Sierra, has been designed from scratch. GMC has been criticized previously for simply selling glorified Chevrolet models at higher prices, a common industry practice. 
The new Sierra Denali — GMC uses the Denali sub-brand on luxury trucks, SUVs and crossovers — has striking lines and features including a high-tech tailgate that opens six different ways. 
The new Denali also features leather seats with heating and cooling functions, and a new infotainment system with a smartphone-like display screen. The pickup also has added leg-room in the back and luxury wood trimmings, though GM executives say the pickup has lost none of its functions as a heavy-duty work vehicle.
But even the old Sierra Denali's most striking detail was its price. Last year, the pickup truck's average transaction price was around $56,000, according to J.D. Power. 
""As you can imagine, the Denali is a huge profit contributor to GM,"" GMC brand chief Duncan Aldred said. He declined to provide targets, but said GMC expects to grow its share of the luxury market. The 2019 Sierra Denali will go on sale late 2018.
A sticker price over $50,000 qualifies as ""premium."" 
According to Kelley Blue Book (KBB), the average transaction price in 2017 for all GMC Sierra models was $49,615. For Ford Motor Co's (N:F) F-Series trucks, it was $49,439, and a Fiat Chrysler Automobile NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) Ram pickup averaged $46,789. 
Those averages include far-cheaper models, but are still higher than the average for luxury sedans like the BMW 3 Series, Audi's (DE:NSUG) A4 and Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) Lexus ES. For a graphic, see http://tmsnrt.rs/2F11cR9 
REVAMPED
Last month GM unveiled a revamped Chevrolet Silverado truck and forecast higher profits in 2019 thanks to its new high-margin pickup trucks.
The F-series has been the best-selling model line for 41 years, with 2017 sales of nearly 900,000 vehicles. GM sold a total of 947,972 of its four Chevrolet and GMC pickup models, two of which are mid-sized.
Around a third of Ford's F-Series pickup trucks count as premium, meaning around 12 percent of Ford's 2017 total U.S. sales were luxury trucks. Luxury models make up about 30 percent of FCA's pickup truck sales. 
Pickup prices range from around $25,000 to as much as $100,000. Industry analysts estimate gross margins for some top-of-the-line trucks can exceed $50,000.
Margins matter more in a declining market.
U.S. new vehicle sales fell more than 2 percent in 2017 - and should drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars return to dealer lots to compete with new ones. 
Passenger car sales declined 11 percent last year. But SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks rose 4.3 percent.
Major automakers posted lower U.S. new vehicle sales for February on Thursday as consumer demand continued to cool following a lengthy boom, despite strong crossovers and SUV sales.
Luxury pickups are ""the perfect storm for"" Detroit's automakers, said Jeff Schuster, consultancy LMC Automotive's head of forecasting. ""Consumers want them and they provide the biggest margin boost in a flat-to-falling market.""
Texas consumers want them more. 
According to KBB, in 2017 through November, Texans bought 260,000 pickup trucks, 20.7 percent of the state's total vehicle sales. Nationally, pickups account for 12 percent of sales. 
GM sells a third of its trucks in its south-central division - Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas - and 80 percent of its high-end Sierra Denali versions are sold there.
""If you think about this segment, there are not that many competitors,"" GMC's Aldred said. ""That obviously gives us a better share of market and enables us to stand out more."" 
IHS Markit's Libby said luxury versions of GM's and FCA's pickups grew as a share of sales from 2016 to 2017. 

""The economy is doing well and that will help the industry in general, but it will help more with vehicles like these,"" Libby said.

(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (N:PG) said on Thursday it cut digital advertising spend by $200 million last year based on viewership data provided by tech and media companies that showed its ads were not reaching its target audience effectively. 
P&G, the world's biggest advertiser, has been at the forefront of a campaign to pressure digital media companies to be transparent with their viewership metrics by telling them how many people see their ads and how ad agencies spend advertising dollars.
These efforts have led tech companies such as Facebook (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) YouTube to rework algorithms to check content quality, empower marketers with more control on their ads and protect them from being associated with unrelated or inappropriate content. 
""Transparency shined a spotlight on reality and we learned valuable lessons which are driving profound change,"" Marc Pritchard, P&G's chief brand officer said at the Association of National Advertisers' media conference in Orlando, Florida on Thursday. 
""With transparent viewability data, we learned that the average view time for an ad on a mobile newsfeed is 1.7 seconds – little more than a glance – pushing us to innovate."" 
Pritchard said fresh data on ad consumption encouraged P&G to reduce digital spending to several big media companies by 20 percent to 50 percent last year. 
The consumer goods conglomerate said it cut digital spending by more $100 million between April and June of 2017 and continued with the cuts at the same rate for the rest of the year.
P&G, however, has not cut overall media spending. Funds have been reinvested to increase media reach, including in areas such as TV, audio and ecommerce media, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.

P&G's advertising costs, which includes spends on worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store advertising, were $7.1 billion in 2017, down from $7.2 billion in 2016. Its digital spending amounts to a third of the total spend.

The billionaire investor, who has made a career out of shaking up management, told cable news network CNBC that the company's stock is undervalued and that he has spoken with Newell Chief Executive Officer Mike Polk.
He also praised the management team at  Herbalife  (N:HLF) where he is the largest investor. He said he has no personal animosity toward rival investor William Ackman who spent six years betting against the nutrition company's future.
Icahn said he had been thinking about possibly putting up a slate of directors at Newell which makes Rubbermaid containers, Diamond matches, Yankee Candles and Sharpie markers. But before the nomination deadline he realized someone else was thinking the same thing. ""I'm going to be the third horse in a three horse race. I just decided why should I get into it?"" 
While he declined to quantify his position in Newell, he said he owns ""one of the larger positions,"" and that he may be influential in deciding who wins the proxy contest.
Icahn has not returned a call to expand on the comments he made on CNBC.
Rival activist investment firm Starboard Value LP, which owns about 4 percent of Newell, last month announced plans to oust Newell's entire board, including the CEO.
The company's shares were up 3.2 percent at $26.52 in afternoon trading.. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Icahn said he has not sold a single share of the roughly 23 million Herbalife shares he owns. ""I'm bullish on the company,"" he said, adding ""But I don't go out and say what I'm going to do with my stocks.""
On Wednesday, Ackman said he had ended his battle against Herbalife which cost him and his clients hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. He called the company a fraud, saying it was running an illegal pyramid scheme where distributors earn more for wooing new recruits than for selling the products.

Icahn said Ackman called him on Wednesday to tell him the news that he was out and congratulated him as the stock price surged. ""It was a classy thing,"" Icahn said about Ackman after having once called him a ""crybaby in the schoolyard.""

Investors from around the world are seeking 9 billion euros ($11 billion) in damages from Volkswagen (VW), which they say didn't inform shareholders quickly enough over its use of illegal software to cheat U.S. tests on diesel engine emissions.
About 1,600 lawsuits, nearly all from institutional investors, have been lodged at a regional court in Braunschweig near VW's Wolfsburg headquarters, seeking damages over the sharp fall in VW shares that followed its admission of wrongdoing.
In a 300-page submission to the court on Wednesday, lawyers for Europe's largest automaker said it had no duty to disclose the possible financial damage of its manipulations prior to Sept. 22, 2015, when it issued an ad-hoc statement that the illegal software could be in around 11 million cars worldwide 
Although the company had admitted its cheating to U.S. authorities on Sept. 3, 2015, it believed potential fines from regulators and vehicle refitting costs would not exceed 300 million euros ($366 million) and therefore would not lead to a significant drop in the stock price, sources close to VW said.
Had the company believed the financial cost of its cheating could have reached 1 billion euros or more, it would have considered an earlier ad-hoc release, the sources added.
Since the ""dieselgate"" scandal became public, VW has set aside around $30 billion to cover fines, vehicle refits to remove the illegal ""defeat device"" software and other costs. 
""In the past there have again and again been violations of the defeat device ban in U.S. environmental law but without the affected companies getting sanctioned in a draconian and hard way,"" VW lawyers said in the submission. 
""An escalation of the matter ... wasn't expected, neither by the defendants nor by their advisers,"" they added. 
The sources said former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn, who resigned within a week of the scandal breaking, was informed in an internal memo in May 2014 that VW models had violated U.S. emissions rules and U.S. authorities would check whether the carmaker was using illegal software.
However, they said the implications of this were not grasped at the time. Winterkorn said when he resigned that he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part. 

Public hearings of the case at the Braunschweig court are due to start in early September.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>","U.S. government extends foreclosure relief in Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands","By Nick Brown
(Reuters) - The Federal Housing Administration on Thursday extended through May 18 a foreclosure moratorium for certain homeowners in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which were devastated last September by Hurricane Maria.
Homeowners whose mortgages are insured by the FHA will get an additional 60 days of foreclosure relief on top of the previously-imposed 180-day moratorium, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the FHA's parent agency. 
FHA insures more than 117,000 mortgages in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, or about one-third of all mortgages on the island. Though Puerto Rico is home to 3.4 million U.S. citizens, the number of mortgages is limited by the prevalence of illegal housing, thought to comprise around half the homes on the island.
FHA also insures around 600 mortgages in the Virgin Islands. Both territories' economies are struggling to bounce back from the Sept. 20 hurricane. 
In Puerto Rico, the local power grid was virtually destroyed, and thousands remain without power, more than five months after the storm. 
Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello welcomed the extension, saying it would help the island's low-income and elderly populations.
""My thanks to [HUD Secretary Ben] Carson for extending the moratorium so that American citizens living on the island receive a relief and are not exposed to losing their homes,"" Rossello said in a statement.
About 90,000 borrowers in Puerto Rico were delinquent in their payments as of December, according to the statement from Rossello's office. Nearly half the island's population lives under the poverty line.
Maria exacerbated a decade-long financial crisis in Puerto Rico, which culminated in May with the island filing the largest bankruptcy in U.S. government history.
Puerto Rico has some $71.5 billion in bond debt, and another $50 billion or so in unfunded public pension liabilities.

Responding to questions Thursday from the Senate Banking Committee, Powell said a system where goods and services flow freely is a net positive for many countries, though the benefits aren’t spread equally. New York Fed President William Dudley was even more explicit in his criticism of trade barriers, saying in a speech in Brazil that “protectionism is not the answer.”
Trump said the U.S. plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum, with a formal order to be signed next week. “You’re going to have protection for the first time in a long time,” he told a gathering of metals industry executives at the White House.
Powell, without commenting directly on any specific country’s policy, said the “best approach is to deal directly with the people who are directly affected, rather than falling back on tariffs.”
Dudley said such penalties “often backfire” and hurt workers.
“Trade barriers are a very expensive way to preserve jobs in less competitive or declining industries,” Dudley said. “Raising trade barriers would risk setting off a trade war, which could damage economic growth prospects around the world.”

The deal rules out outright layoffs and will give priority to offering employees positions elsewhere in the company. It also opens an option for a collective bargaining deal under new labor rules introduced by the new government last year, the statement said.

Last month, Societe Generale reported an unexpected profit in the fourth quarter, beating forecasts that the French bank would make a loss partly due to tax-related charges and restructuring costs.

583,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. Treasury to close 'carried interest' loophole in new tax law,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Thursday it will close an unintended loophole created by the Republican tax overhaul that let some Wall Street financial managers dodge new limits on ""carried interest"" by operating as businesses known as S-corporations.
Carried interest refers to a longstanding Wall Street tax break that let many private equity and hedge fund financiers pay the lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income, instead of the higher income tax rate paid by wage-earners.
President Donald Trump vowed to close the loophole during the 2016 presidential election campaign. 
Republican tax legislation signed into law by Trump in December required fund managers to hold investments for at least three years before becoming eligible for the lower capital gains rate, but it exempted corporations.
Media reports soon followed saying that some investment funds were setting up pass-through entities known as S-corporations in the hopes of qualifying for the corporate exemption and skirting the carried interest restriction. 
On Thursday, the Treasury and its tax-collecting Internal Revenue Service announced that forthcoming regulations will prevent S-corporations from taking advantage of the carried interest exemption. 
S-corporations are a form of business entity that passes profits on to business owners as personal income.
New Treasury rules are expected to specify that the exemption applies only to C-corporations, including publicly traded companies, which pay income tax before distributing net profits to shareholders as dividends. 
""We worked expeditiously to take this first step to clarify that S corporations are subject to the three-year holding period for carried interest,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. 

The American Investment Council, which represents private equity investors, welcomed Treasury's guidance, saying in a statement that the government's position ""correctly clarifies the intent of the law.""

NEW YORK (LPC) - The three banks leading the US$13.5bn-equivalent loan and bond financing backing US private equity firm Blackstone Group’s acquisition of a majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ (TO:TRI) Financial and Risk (F&R) unit are set to sign more banks into the deal. 
Around 21 senior banks are expected to join the deal, which is being led by JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), and is the biggest buyout financing since the financial crisis. 
The lead banks invited 23 banks to join at the next level and underwrite 28% of the deal for fees ranging from around 3% to less than 1%, several sources said.
Blackstone (N:BX) is buying a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters' F&R unit, which includes LPC and IFR. Senior participation in the financing was linked to the amount of business that the banks do with Thomson Reuters. 
Banks making the biggest commitments after the leads are  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and UBS, the sources said. There could be six or seven tiers of commitments. 
Other banks that are expected to join the deal include  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), HSBC,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Royal Bank of Canada, SMBC, MUFG, Mizuho,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN),  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN), Natixis, BMO, Toronto Dominion, Unicredit (MI:CRDI),  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), ING and Jefferies.
The group is expected to be confirmed and banks signed into the deal in the next few days, sources said. 
Blackstone could not immediately be reached for comment. JP Morgan, BAML and Citigroup declined to comment. 
Lenders may have to sit on their commitments for some time, due to a lengthy commitment period, the sources said. 
The deal is not expected to be syndicated more widely to institutional investors until the end of June at the earliest, and could even be launched after the summer, they added. 
DEAL STRUCTURE
The deal includes a US$8bn-equivalent term loan B, which is split between US$5.5bn and US$2.5bn-equivalent in euros.
The financing also includes US$3bn-equivalent of secured bonds split between US$2bn and US$1bn-equivalent in euros, and US$2.5bn-equivalent of unsecured bonds split between US$1.8bn and US$700m-equivalent in euros.
The company will also place a US$750m revolving credit facility.
Additional funding comes from US$1bn in preferred equity – with a 14.5% Payment-In-Kind (PIK) coupon – US$3bn of cash equity that Blackstone is contributing, and US$2.5bn of existing equity, based on the US$20bn valuation, that will be rolled over.
Leverage is expected to be around 4.5 times through the secured debt and 5.6 times total debt after Ebitda adjustments, which could be as much as 30% as the transaction is a carve-out and involves reallocating costs.
The size of the debt and leverage currently imply Ebitda of about US$2.4bn, including around US$650m of cost savings, based on the last 12 months’ Ebitda of approximately US$1.7bn for the F&R unit.
The currency splits and Ebitda figures may change depending on investor demand the timing of the wider institutional syndication.

The third-largest U.S. bank's board of directors is looking at whether customers in its smallest business to 401(k) plans, certain alternative investments and brokerage operations, according to its annual 10-K U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
The U.S. Justice Department instructed Wells Fargo in late 2017 to investigate its wealth management business after whistleblowers accused the bank of pushing nonessential products or services on customers, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Thursday.
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kathleen Leary directed Reuters to a statement by Chief Executive Tim Sloan, who said the review happened after inquiries from government agencies.
""When we discover a problem, we are moving to find the root cause and fix it,"" Sloan said. He emphasized Wells Fargo's effort to be more transparent as it discovers new issues.
Wells Fargo has been embroiled in a sales-practice scandal in its retail operations for more than a year, primarily related to employees opening perhaps 3.5 million phony accounts in customers' names without their permission.
The bank also found evidence that some customer accounts were improperly closed, or their funds were improperly frozen, and that customers were enrolled in ""add-on"" products like identity theft protection that they did not request.
Problems in other areas, including mortgage lending and auto insurance, also have surfaced through internal reviews and regulatory probes. But until now, Wells Fargo's wealth and investment management business had largely avoided scrutiny.
According to the filing, as part of its review of the wealth business, Wells found that some customers were overcharged for investment and fiduciary services due to ""incorrect set-up and maintenance in the system of record."" The bank is now trying to determine the extent of the issue and causes of any problems in the unit, which generated $2.7 billion worth of profit last year.

610,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>",How Geely's Li Shufu spent months stealthily building a $9 billion stake in Daimler,"By Adam Jourdan and Norihiko Shirouzu
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - When  Daimler  announced that Li Shufu had acquired almost 10 percent of the automaker last Friday, it caught financial markets - and German regulators - by surprise.
Although the move seemed sudden, the head of the Chinese carmaker Geely had, according to multiple sources and documents reviewed by Reuters, spent months stealthily laying groundwork for the stake.
Two sources in Geely and one source close to the company said a senior executive there, Li Yifan, had for more than a year led a small team tasked with acquiring shares in Daimler.
By using Hong Kong shell companies, derivatives, bank financing and carefully structured share options, Li Shufu kept the plan under wraps until he could, at a stroke, become Daimler's single largest shareholder.
The result was a $9 billion investment that skirted disclosure rules requiring investors to notify German authorities if their share of voting rights in a company passed 3 percent, and then 5 percent. Because of the way the stake was built, there is no indication that Geely breached those rules.
""The fact that Li would invest did not come as a surprise,"" said a senior Daimler executive, who did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""But how he went about it certainly was.""
A NUMBERS GAME
The shell company used to amass the stake, Tenaciou3 Prospect Investment Ltd, was incorporated on Oct. 27 in Hong Kong. The company had just one ordinary share, worth HK$1 (12.8 U.S. cents), according to documents filed to the Hong Kong Companies Registry. It also has a single director: Li Yifan.
Reuters reported in November that Daimler rejected a proposal by Geely to acquire a stake or reach a technology-sharing deal. The next month, Tenaciou3 signed agreements, subsequently filed with Hong Kong's companies registry, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) that would help the Chinese company build its stake in a less-direct way.
Last week, Daimler AG (DE:DAIGn) named Tenaciou3 in a regulatory filing as the entity controlling Li Shufu's 9.69 percent stake.
A person with knowledge of the deal said Morgan Stanley had worked on the structure of the investments, helped Li build up his position in the secondary market and provided financing. The person asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Geely also hired two former Morgan Stanley executives, Dirk Notheis in Germany, and Bao Yi, who worked in China, to help the banks devise tactics that would avoid immediately triggering disclosure requirements in Germany, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Tenaciou3 purchased some shares on its own, but not enough to require disclosure. 
The banks then acquired additional shares in two ways without Geely having an entitlement to the shares and therefore no requirement to disclose the holding, according to two people familiar with the matter. 
Some were purchased directly, and the risk was offset by an ""equity collar"" structure to protect the investment from losses. That involved selling options for the right to buy shares above the then-prevailing price while buying options to gain the right to sell the shares below the price.
The banks also gained the right to acquire some shares by buying derivatives, the sources said.
Only when the shares were sold to Tenaciou3 did the stake need to be disclosed.
Li Yifan did not respond to requests for comment. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America declined to comment.
Daimler also declined to comment.
Li Shufu was not immediately available for comment.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday there were no obvious violations linked to the acquisition, although the country's financial regulator, BaFin, is investigating whether disclosure rules were broken.
In a report to Germany's parliament, seen by Reuters, the country's Economy Ministry said it would consider tightening disclosure regulations in light of the Chinese stake in Daimler. 
SHELLS WITHIN SHELLS
The structure of the deal makes it difficult to determine the source of the money behind it.
On paper, Tenaciou3 is owned by another Hong Kong-registered company, Fujikiro Ltd, which lists a third company, Miroku Ltd, as a director. The other directors of both these companies are all senior partners at global law firm King & Wood Mallesons, according to official records. 
Li Shufu is not named in any of the documents seen by Reuters, but he has openly said he is the owner of the stake held by Tenaciou3.
The practice of using shell companies as investment vehicles and lawyers to act as directors on behalf of wealthy investors is fairly common.
King & Wood Mallesons declined to comment.
Geely officials familiar with the transaction said the shell company was set up in part to make the deal an ""offshore"" acquisition and avoid the heightened recent scrutiny from Beijing on deals in which funds are moved out of mainland China.
The company has said that all the funds for the deal were raised outside China, although industry consultants said the use of the Hong Kong entity made that hard to verify.
A separate shell company, Tenaciou3 Investment Holdings Ltd, directly controlled by Geely, borrowed 1.67 billion euros ($2.04 billion) from the Hong Kong branch of Chinese bank Industrial Bank Co Ltd (SS:601166), according to an agreement dated Dec. 5 and filed in Hong Kong.
A Daimler filing shows Tenaciou3 Investment Holdings, whose director was listed as Li Yifan, as the controlling entity behind Tenaciou3 Prospect.
Tenaciou3 Investment Holdings used its share capital in Tenaciou3 Prospect Investment as collateral for the loan.
The agreement with Industrial Bank did not say what the funds would be used for.
Industrial Bank, which is headquartered in China’s southeastern city of Fuzhou, did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. 
Angela Stanzel, Berlin-based senior policy fellow focused on Asia at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said the main concern in Germany was the lack of transparency.
""The issue is, where does the money come from and how did this bid actually happen?"" she told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Insurer Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd is refusing to pay for Harvey Weinstein's legal defense against 11 lawsuits that accuse the movie producer of sexually harassing or assaulting women over the past three decades, according to a court document filed on Wednesday.
Units of the insurer have together issued 80 policies to Weinstein and his family between 1994 and 2018, including coverage for personal liability, according to Chubb. That would normally cover legal costs to defend against claims of damage or injury caused accidentally, but the insurer said Weinstein's conduct was intentional. 
The co-founder of the Miramax studio and The Weinstein Company was one of Hollywood’s most influential men before more than 70 women accused him of sexual misconduct, including assault. He denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.
He faces many legal cases, including one brought by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accusing him of civil and human rights violations.
Chubb Indemnity Insurance Co and several other Chubb units asked New York State Supreme Court to issue a judgment declaring that the policies' terms exclude defending charges in the lawsuits, specifically sexual assault, discrimination and intentional acts.

A representative and lawyer for Weinstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Negotiators trying to rework the NAFTA trade deal on Thursday were hit by the prospect of a battle over U.S. steel tariffs that could make it more complicated to build autos in North America, one of the most sensitive issues at the talks.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he would impose the tariffs beginning next week, raising the risk of exacerbating tensions at negotiations already facing serious challenges.
Officials were unable to say immediately whether the tariffs would include imports from Canada and Mexico, the other two partners in the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement.
For months, the three nations have been mired in disagreement over a U.S. demand to require a greater portion of North American auto parts and components under NAFTA, which Trump has threatened to ditch if it is not recast to his liking.
Moises Kalach, head of the international negotiating arm of Mexico's CCE business lobby, said Trump's call for a 25 percent tariff on imported steel appeared intended to increase U.S. content in industrial goods but would have unintended consequences.
""Who is the priority here? Workers? Consumers? Somebody will end up paying for this,"" Kalach told Reuters on the sidelines of the latest NAFTA talks in Mexico City. ""What's going to happen to the competitiveness of North America?""
Canada is the largest exporter of steel by far to the United States, and Trump's proposed tariff would raise the cost of building vehicles, experts say.
""This would be very bad news for the auto industry,"" said one person close to the negotiations.
Though it differs by company, for their vehicles made in North America,  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and General Motors Co (N:GM) source the vast majority of their steel from North America, according to the auto industry.
GM on Thursday said in a statement that 90 percent of the steel in its U.S.-built vehicles came from U.S. suppliers.
AUTO TALKS
The United States, Mexico and Canada had already been planning to schedule extra discussions on trade rules for auto production, two people familiar with the matter said.
The proposed talks, at the level of technical experts, would take place in March before the next formal NAFTA session, which is due to be held in Washington in late March or early April.
Talks on the issue during the seventh round were suspended this week when the U.S. negotiator overseeing auto rules of origin, Jason Bernstein, unexpectedly returned to Washington for consultations with industry.
Officials have made little progress on the most contentious files since the talks started in August, and the talks look set to drag on well beyond March, when negotiators had hoped to finish.
Under NAFTA, 62.5 percent of the net cost of a passenger car or light truck must originate in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs. Trump wants the threshold raised to 85 percent and is also seeking to ensure that half the total content is U.S.-made.
The auto industry has opposed those demands, arguing it would disrupt supply chains and raise costs.
Negotiators have struggled to advance on the auto proposal since it was submitted in October. Automakers are evaluating ideas put forward by Canada last month to include newer technology in the calculation of a vehicle's value.
The current round of negotiations is set to end on Monday, when Mexican Economy Minster Ildefonso Guajardo, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland are scheduled to meet in the Mexican capital.
Separately, Mexico's chief NAFTA negotiator, Kenneth Smith, said on Twitter that the three sides had completed talks on good regulatory practices.

Sources close to the talks said negotiators have also paved the way for closing the telecommunications portion of the trade deal this weekend, as the United States has dropped a proposal that Mexico opposed.

626,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 04:38PM ET</span>",Weak U.S. February sales chill automaker stocks on Wall Street,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Major automakers reported lower U.S. new vehicle sales for February on Thursday as consumer demand continued to cool despite strong crossovers and SUV sales, but surprisingly weak pickup truck sales dented the share prices of Detroit carmakers.
""Trucks are higher-margin products and from a mix standpoint, February was disappointing,"" said John Toohey, head of equities at USAA Asset Management Company in San Antonio, Texas, which has $166 billion in assets under management. ""If this continues, that's a profitability headwind.""
Total industry auto sales for the month fell 2.4 percent versus February 2017. According to Autodata Corp, which tracks industry sales, the seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) of U.S. car and light truck sales in February fell to 17.08 million units from 17.45 million a year earlier. 
Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a February SAAR of 17.2 million units.
No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) posted a 6.9 percent decline in overall sales from February 2017. The automaker said sales to consumers were down 10 percent ""compared to an exceptionally strong February 2017."" 
GM's lower-margin fleet sales climbed 7 percent, driven by a 15 percent rise in commercial vehicles. Crossovers and SUVs fared well in GM's sales. 
But its Silverado and Sierra pickup truck models dropped significantly versus the same month a year earlier. 
 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) reported a 1 percent overall decline in February sales.
While its popular Jeep brand's total sales surged 12 percent, its Ram pickup trucks sank 14 percent, driven by a decrease in lower-margin fleet sales. 
Fiat Chrysler has deliberately pursued a strategy of scaling back lower-margin fleet sales in favor of more lucrative sales to consumers.
F-SERIES FLIES
No. 2 U.S. automaker  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said its sales also fell, by 6.9 percent, with an 8.5 percent drop for retail sales as passenger car sales sank 12 percent. 
Unlike its Detroit rivals, Ford saw a 1.2 percent increase in pickup truck sales as its best-selling F-Series models posted their 10th consecutive months of sales gains.
""The F-Series continues to be a great story for us,"" Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said on a conference call. 
Both GM and FCA have completely revamped pickup truck models hitting the market later this year, and USAA's Toohey said that might have affected their February sales.
""The optimistic view is that people are just waiting for their next generation of trucks,"" he said. ""The negative view is that good truck sales are in the rearview mirror.""
""I think it's probably a mix of both,"" he added.
The auto industry has been coming off a long boom that began at the end of the Great Recession.
U.S. auto industry sales fell 2 percent last year to 17.23 million vehicles after hitting a record high in 2016.
New vehicle sales are expected to drop further in 2018 despite a solid economy.
Interest rates are rising and around 4 million late-model used cars will return to dealer lots this year to compete with more expensive new ones.
'HIBERNATION'
Historically, February tends to be a weak month for sales.
Michelle Krebs, an analyst for car-shopping website Autotrader, said pickup trucks ""did not have a spectacular month, despite some hefty"" consumer discounts. 
""March and April will truly indicate whether vehicle sales are ready to come out of hibernation,"" she said in an email.
GM Chief Economist Mustafa Mohatarem said consumers have not yet fully felt the benefits of a recent U.S. tax overhaul. 
""We expect consumer spending to pick up as tax cuts are reflected in pay checks,"" he said.
Judy Wheeler, head of U.S. sales for the Nissan brand at Nissan Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), echoed that point, adding that strong used-car sales in February might reflect consumer concerns over rising interest rates.
Nissan's sales fell 4 percent in February, despite a 9 percent rise in sales of pickup trucks, crossovers and SUVs. 
Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) said its sales fell 5 percent in February. 
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) bucked the broader trend, posting a 4.5 percent increase in sales in February, as a 10.3 percent gain in SUV and pickup truck sales offset a 2.6 percent drop in passenger cars. 

In afternoon trading, GM shares were down 3.6 percent at $37.91, Ford shares were down 2.9 percent at $10.30, and FCA was down 2.4 percent at $20.68.

Changes in volatility measures may only be short-term reactions rather than a wholesale regime shift, offering a potential tonic to traders who have been on edge since inflation data punched up turbulence in late January. That handed global stocks their worst month since 2016, while U.S. 10-year yields marched to the highest in four years.
Yet equity and Treasury volatility markets show few signs of unabated fear. The move in the Cboe Volatility index futures curve has been contained to the front end for the most part, suggesting muted expectations for choppy equity conditions further out. U.S. government bonds tell a similar story.
Meanwhile, appetite for longer-dated paper may reemerge. Add to that spotty economic data suggesting a peak in the inflation recovery story, and the threats that could move us into a pocket of higher volatility have receded, according to Michael Purves, global chief strategist at Weeden & Co.
“The volatility surface continues to normalize,” Purves wrote in a Wednesday note. “This presumed rate/volatility regime shift is a much more gradual process than one might have expected.”
Market Mayhem
During February’s turmoil, front-month futures for the VIX jumped 38 percent while the back end advanced 9.7 percent. Of course, that difference is to be expected during sharp selloffs, as investors price in current market mayhem versus the less-known environment of the future.
Yet after the turmoil subsided, increased volatility still mainly showed up in the front end of the curve. Even following Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell’s testimony to Congress this week, front-month futures gained 12 percent compared with 2.9 percent for the longer-dated contracts, as traders priced in less impact from his hawkishness down the road.
Not everyone is convinced the threat of a sustained shift to higher volatility has passed. The ultra-low regime is already behind us, according to Societe Generale.
“The Fed is more tolerant of market volatility, and central bank balance sheets are gradually becoming lighter,” derivatives strategists at the bank headed by Jitesh Kumar wrote in a Wednesday note. “Hence, options market flow could move further away from the kind of short vol carry trade that flourished in the recent past, which have been fueling the depressed volatility environment.”
Bears and Bids
One of the biggest catalysts for increased turbulence is continued pain in the U.S. bond market. But yields may not stay elevated for much longer, if history is a guide. Positioning in longer-dated paper shows extreme bearishness -- in the past, that has been followed by a bid for the 10-year.
Last month, investors held the most net short contracts on 10-year futures in nearly a year, and have already slightly reduced their short exposure, CFTC data show.
The uptick in volatility in the interest-rate market is also modest compared with the panic over higher U.S. yields in the aftermath of the 2016 election or the Taper Tantrum of 2013. A gauge of price swings in the Treasury market has risen by 16 points this year to 63 -- still below its five-year average of 68.6.
Investors may be reacting to economic indicators that suggest the worst inflation scares are behind us, said Purves.
“Forward inflation has consolidated its move higher, but has failed to accelerate while the Citi economic and inflation surprise indices continue to trend downwards,” he wrote. “Weaker than expected CPI prints in Europe and the weaker China PMI’s confirm that the global growth/global inflation recovery story may well have peaked for the time being.”

Comcast, the owner of NBC, MSNBC and Universal Pictures, said on Tuesday it proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain's Sky, more than the 10.75 pounds that Fox has agreed to pay for it.
Murdoch's Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent stake of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain.
In December, Disney agreed to buy a number of Fox assets, including Fox's stake in Sky, in a separate $52-billion deal.
The next likely step is Comcast makes a firm offer, which would require the company to have its funding in place. Fox then could return with a higher offer. 
Here are some of the scenarios on what may lie in store next for Sky:
FOX RAISES ITS BID
The most likely scenario, according to many analysts, is that Fox, with Disney's blessing, raises its bid, potentially prompting a bidding war with Comcast. Fox has to at least match Comcast's bid, but analysts estimate a final winning bid for Sky could go as high as 14 to 15 pounds per share. Sky's shares jumped Tuesday 20 percent, closing at 13.31 pounds, above Comcast's offer.
Under the terms of Fox's deal with Disney, Disney cannot bid for Sky on it own, so any bid would come from Fox. However, Disney CEO Bob Iger has spoken about the importance of Sky to Disney's plan to launch a global online streaming service. So it is likely that Disney would back Fox in bidding higher.
COMCAST WINS MAJORITY STAKE IN SKY
Fox could choose not to challenge Comcast, which has said its offer is contingent on acquiring more than 50 percent of Sky. Comcast would prefer to own the whole of Sky, so Fox could use its 39 percent stake in the company as a bargaining chip.
Once the its deal with Fox closes, Disney will own a majority stake in online streaming service Hulu in which Comcast is also a shareholder. Some investors have speculated that Disney could swap its controlling stake in Hulu as part of a deal for Comcast's stake in Sky. 
Comcast is currently bound as a passive investor of Hulu, meaning it cannot buy more shares in the company, under its consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice when it bought NBCUniversal. However, that consent decree expires in September. 
GOING ALL IN
There is an outside chance that Comcast could engage with Fox about buying the assets Disney is buying. Comcast had bid $60 billion before losing out to Disney, and sources have told Reuters that Comcast has been discussing bidding for the Fox assets again. 

But such a deal would face significant regulatory hurdles in the U.S., which previously prompted Fox to snub Comcast's bid. There is no reason to believe that Fox's assessment of the regulatory risk will change.

Right before the stock market's recent 10% correction caught many traders off-guard, he issued a strong sell signal. He's even gone as far as to outline a four-part formula for a market meltdown.
Yet while Hartnett's bearish side has driven much of his recent commentary, he still sees a way for the stock market's ongoing rally to become the ""greatest bull market of all time."" At more than 3,250 trading days, it's already the second-longest on record. All it needs is roughly 1,200 more days without a 20% drop to become the king of all bull markets.
Hartnett pinpoints two specific drivers that could take the benchmark S&P 500 to the promised land:
But don't think Hartnett is going soft on his bearish market outlook. Even if a perfect combination of factors pushes stocks higher, he argues the ""last great entry point"" into stocks came more than two years ago, on February 11, 2016.
Overall, Hartnett's core stance is to stay cautiously optimistic when it comes to stocks — a view matching what BAML's global team has been saying. In late January, James Barty, the firm's head of global cross-asset and European equity strategy, warned that markets were ""starting to get a little stretched,"" while urging caution.
With all of that in mind, investors would be advised to proceed warily. After all, the  10% correction that rocked US equities in early February was jarring for many traders who probably wish they'd been better hedged."
651,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 09:20AM ET</span>","Indian diamond traders say fraud suspects Modi, Choksi didn't follow code","By Rajendra Jadhav and Jessica Kuruthukulangara
SURAT, India /BENGALURU (Reuters) - Some diamond merchants in India's biggest center for trading the precious gemstones say they had stopped dealing with Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi - two big-name jewelers accused of massive bank fraud - because they were often slow to pay dues.
The Indian financial sector was stunned when  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) said in mid-February it was the victim of a $1.77 billion fraud - a figure that has since risen to nearly $2 billion. The second-largest state bank blamed Modi and Choksi, accusing them of conspiring with bank employees to obtain fraudulent credit overseas. Both deny any involvement.
Modi, who runs eponymously branded high-end jewelry stores that stretch from New York to Hong Kong, and Choksi, who heads  Gitanjali Gems  (NS:GTGM) and operates stores under banners including Gili, Nakshatra and Asmi, both belong to the Jain community from the western state of Gujarat.
The Jain and Patel communities dominate the diamond cutting and polishing business centered on the Gujarati city of Surat. Traders there who spoke to Reuters said the two jewelers had acquired a reputation for not following the industry's unwritten code of business ethics.
""Nirav Modi and Gitanjali's business model wasn't convincing to us,"" says Seventilal Shah, chairman of Venus Jewel, who said he had stopped dealing with either business some years ago.
""If they take goods on two months credit, and there is one month's delay it is fine. But if it is regular episodes of delays, then there is something wrong. That was the case with these guys.""
Representatives for both Modi and Choksi did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Indian authorities say both men left the country in early January and their whereabouts are unknown.
In the tight-knit Jain and Patel gem trading fraternities, where many struggle to get bank credit, most business is done informally, with cash lent and goods advanced without collateral or paperwork.
""Mehul didn't understand the importance of trust,"" said one Surat-based diamond exporter, who has been in the business for nearly five decades and asked not to be named.
""Once we sold him polished diamonds and we had to chase him for payment almost every month for six months. Every time he used to give some excuse, then we decided to stop doing business with him altogether.""
Eight traders in Surat, where roughly 80 percent of the world's diamonds are cut and polished, complained of similar issues in their dealings with both Modi and Choksi.
""That's why many merchants stopped dealing with Gitanjali or Modi's company long back,"" said Dinesh Navadiya, former president of Surat Diamond Association, who runs a small diamond business in the city.
Gitanjali, in a stock exchange filing, has denied any involvement in the alleged fraud. Choksi, in an open letter to employees on Feb. 23, protested his innocence but advised them to look for other jobs, as his assets had been seized and he was unable to pay their salaries. 
In a letter to Punjab National Bank (PNB) (NS:PNBK), which says it discovered the alleged fraud at one of its Mumbai branches, Modi disputed the bank's allegations, arguing the sums he owes PNB are far smaller than those outlined by the bank. Modi's lawyer has also denied the allegations.

FRANCHISE MODEL
Both men have had minor brushes with authorities in the past.
In 2015, Modi was fined 480 million rupees for exporting and importing the same diamonds through Surat's Special Economic Zone to inflate export numbers, an official with the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence said.
In July 2013 the Indian markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, barred Choksi from trading for six months for manipulating Gitanjali's share price.
Neither case drew much attention at the time and both men continued to expand their businesses, tapping Bollywood stars to promote their brands. 
Choksi's Gitanjali adopted a franchise model to open new retail stores, but two franchisees who spoke to Reuters said it failed to deliver on promises made.
Hari Prasad said he invested roughly 100 million rupees ($1.5 million) to set up a Gitanjali store in Bengaluru in 2012. Gitanjali promised to manage operations including inventory, staff recruitment, salaries, rent and electricity bills, he said.
But he alleges Gitanjali charged him inflated prices for old or inferior stock he could not sell for a profit, and he closed the store in 2014.
Choksi and officials of Gitanjali Gems were not reachable for comment.
In 2016, Prasad and six other franchisees jointly wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office accusing Choksi of fraud.
The prime minister's office (PMO) forwarded his complaint to the Registrar of Companies, which closed the case, said Prasad, who showed Reuters copies of the correspondence.
The PMO and the Registrar of Companies did not respond to requests for comment.
""I had to believe him (Choksi) as he was managing director and chairman of such a big group, which is publicly-listed and has a brand image,"" said Prasad. ""If you go to do business with such types of people, you will believe them.""

(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. steel companies surged on Thursday while those in major manufacturers dipped on speculation that President Donald Trump was preparing to announce hefty tariffs on imported steel to protect domestic producers.
An early morning tweet from Trump said that the steel and aluminum industries needed ""free, fair and smart trade"", adding to expectations he would announce tariffs on foreign imports but stopping short of any announcement.
Shares of AK Steel Holding Corp (N:AKS) jumped as much as 12 percent before trimming those gains to around 7 percent, while those of U.S. Steel Corp (N:X) rose 6 percent.  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE) and  Steel Dynamics  Inc (O:STLD) both gained around 2 percent.
A raft of U.S. industrial companies who are major consumers of steel, including  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Boeing (N:B) and tractor maker Deere & Co (N:DE) saw their shares fall by almost 2 percent. 
Most would face greater costs if Trump forced the price of imported steel, and with it prices of domestically-produced metal, higher. 
The industrial metal companies, the domestically focused ones, are probably going to benefit from this,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in Boston.
""In the longer run we’ve seen that tariffs generally don’t work and actually they generally hurt the economy. In the immediate to longer run it's probably seen as a step towards trade wars (and) retaliation. Negotiations with Nafta could break down over this.""
CNBC cited an unidentified White House official as saying Trump was set to announce tariffs at 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) on Thursday, but also said that officials did not say what the president would specifically announce.
Reuters reported late on Wednesday that several top U.S. steel and aluminum executives had been invited to the White House on Thursday for what could be a major trade announcement.
Trump has vowed to take steps to crack down on imports of steel and aluminum and has been considering imposing hefty tariffs on imports of the metals from China and other countries.

The U.S. Commerce Department recommended last month that Trump impose steep curbs on steel and aluminum imports from China and other countries ranging from global and country-specific tariffs to broad import quotas.

LONDON (Reuters) - Zimbabwe must offer foreign miners a consistent legal framework, the right to keep a controlling stake in operations and a greater share of profits to encourage investment, the head of Anglo American Platinum said.
The country, home to the world's second largest reserves of platinum after South Africa, is pinning hopes on a recovery in its mining industry after a coup that pushed out veteran leader Robert Mugabe, whose rule saw the economy plunged into chaos.
But decades of laws that deterred investors with tough terms and frequent changes, low global platinum prices and a crumbling economy have left Zimbabwe's mineral wealth largely untapped.
""We are not investing in any material growth,"" Chief Executive Chris Griffith told Reuters, adding that Amplats was considering investing in a small process to optimize operations, a process known as ""debottlenecking"".
""But that is not betting the farm on Zimbabwe yet,"" he said, adding that terms now on offer and an uncertain global outlook for platinum meant the world's top producer of the metal had no immediate plans for major investment in Zimbabwe.
The southern African nation requires platinum and diamond companies to hand over at least 51 percent of operations to the government, a rule that had extended to the rest of the industry until it was changed last year for other metals.
Amplats, which owns the Unki platinum mine and is building a $62 million smelter, would be among major multinationals that the new mining minister, Winston Chitando, would hope to woo as the nation prepares for elections in six months.
But platinum prices are hurting those recovery prospects.
The industrial precious metal is down more than 50 percent from a record high of nearly $2,300 per ounce in 2008 due to a supply glut and shrinking demand from autocatalyst makers and jewelry buyers in China, the world's biggest consumer.
""CHOPPING AND CHANGING""
Griffith met Zimbabwe's Chitando to discuss issues plaguing the industry, including laws and rules on processing that he said had changed three times since work on Amplats' new smelter started.
The Amplats CEO told the minister that constant changes made taking any investment decision difficult.
""I said (to Chitando): 'You think I will bring half a billion dollars to Zimbabwe when you guys keep chopping and changing the rules? There is no way I will do that.'""
Unki, the smallest of three platinum mines in Zimbabwe, is Amplats' only operation outside South Africa.
The smelter under construction will produce a matte product that will be sent to the company's refinery in South Africa.
As well as concerns about not keeping a controlling stake, miners were concerned that companies were only allowed to retain 20 percent of their foreign earnings, Griffith said.
Following years of cost cuts and asset sales, Amplats paid its first dividend in seven years last week.
""The market is improving all the time so as we get to that position one of the things that will be a key consideration is: does the market want the extra ounces?"" he said.
Zimbabwe will impose a 15 percent penalty tax from Jan. 1, 2019 on exports of platinum producers which do not build refining facilities in the country, Chitando told a mining conference on Wednesday.
Impala Platinum (J:IMPJ), Zimbabwe's largest platinum producer, said last year ""neither the smelter nor the export levy is affordable"" and could lead to the closure of its Mimosa mine.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's WPP (L:WPP) struggled to keep pace with changes in advertising in 2017, with its worst annual sales performance since the financial crisis and a gloomy outlook putting its shares on track for their worst day in 20 years. 
The world's biggest advertising group has been hit by consumer goods clients such as  Unilever  cutting spending and by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and consultants Accenture encroaching on its turf, forcing it to cut its outlook three times in 2017.
""2017 for us was not a pretty year,"" WPP's founder Martin Sorrell said, adding it would accelerate a plan to simplify the group which employs more than 200,000 people in 112 countries through agencies including JWT, Ogilvy & Mather and Finsbury.
Shares in WPP dropped by 14 percent, putting it on track for its worst day since 1998 and wiping 2.3 billion pounds off its market value. Investors had expected it to echo peers Omnicom (N:OMC), IPG (N:IPG) and Publicis (PA:PUBP) in sounding more upbeat about 2018. 
The world's leading advertising giants are rethinking their models after growing through repeated acquisitions of agencies which are often run as separate entities and designed to compete with each other to provide the best service. 
But with technology changing advertising and consumer goods groups demanding cost savings, clients are increasingly wanting to work with one team who can provide a common proposal for media planning, creative ideas, data and analysis. 
""Clients want things to be much more agile, simplified, better and cheaper and that is what we have to respond to,"" Sorrell told Reuters. ""We have been going in that direction but we have to go faster."" 
A strategy it currently uses for its biggest clients such as Ford and Colgate-Palmolive, where it creates a single team to provide all the services required by that company rather than through multiple agencies, could be rolled out more widely.
Publicis has set up ""Chief client officers"" but all the holding companies struggle with the fact their staff are traditionally loyal to the agencies such as Ogilvy & Mather, seen as the inspiration for the Man Men TV series. 
""We start this new phase of our journey from a position of market leadership, and with total confidence in the enduring value of what we offer our clients,"" Sorrell said. 
CHANGING TIMES?
WPP reported a 0.9 percent drop in 2017 underlying net sales, after predicting a broadly flat outcome in October, with demand particularly weak in North America where net sales fell 3.2 percent. Britain was one of the strongest performers. 
For 2018 it said the group's budgets were being set on the basis it would see flat growth for revenue and net sales, with the headline operating margin also flat in constant currency.
That looks particularly cautious when 2018 offers the soccer World Cup, the Winter Olympics, mid-term U.S. elections and a generally more buoyant global economy, factors that would normally boost its sales. 
However net sales were down 1.2 percent in January, showing little sign of improvement.
Looking ahead to its longer-term target, WPP also cut a forecast for annual diluted earnings per share growth to 5 to 10 percent, from a previous forecast of 10 to 15 percent. 
WPP, which Sorrell built from a two-man operation in a London office in 1985 to one with annual billings of 56 billion pounds ($77 billion), has been particularly hurt by the pressures in the packaged goods sector. 
Clients such as Unilever (L:ULVR), Nestle (S:NESN) and Procter and Gamble (N:PG) are cutting spending as consumers turn to more niche brands, hitting sales. 
Unilever is also bringing certain capabilities in-house, such as creating its own content through a new unit. Other clients have also started to make their own content and place it directly on Facebook and Google.
Richard Hunter, head of Markets at Interactive Investor, said cost conscious companies were taking a shorter-term view while there were red flags around the North American region. 
""The jury is still out as to whether WPP has suffered due to a cyclical change, or whether the landscape is actually structurally different,"" he said. 
""The general view of the shares as a buy has been in place for some time, although this will come under increasing pressure in the absence of some rather more positive prospects.""

The tie-up announced Thursday will also allow Harley to work with Brisbane, California-based Alta Motors to develop new electric vehicles. The companies did not disclose any financial details of the investment.
The deal aligns with Harley's strategy to woo the next generation of Harley riders as its devoted Baby Boomer audience grows too old to ride.
Alta and Harley also hope to attract riders drawn to the ease of riding electric motorcycles that have no gears or clutch, the companies said.
The downtrend in Harley-Davidson's recent sales has caused Wall Street to speculate whether the Milwaukee company would seek a buyout, but Chief Executive Matt Levatich has said his company was not exploring any such deal.

Harley plans to invest $25 million to $50 million annually over the next several years to develop electric motorcycle technology. It is already planning to launch its own electric motorcycle next year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) reported a greater-than-expected jump in quarterly sales on Thursday as it sold more mobile phones, gaming products and appliances during the key holiday season.
The No.1 U.S. consumer electronics retailer benefited from the exit and decline of some competitors such as RadioShack and HH Gregg Inc, which filed for bankruptcy and closed hundreds of stores, and tumbling sales at Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD).
The retailer continued to gain market share during the fourth quarter and benefited from strong customer demand and improved product availability, Chief Executive Hubert Joly said on an earnings conference call.
""Last year, we had both product recalls and product availability constraints across multiple vendors and categories,"" Joly said. ""This year... we deliberately invested in having more product in stock and available for customers."" 
Mobile phone sales were boosted by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's (KS:005930) Note smartphone, which the U.S. retailer was unable to sell last year due to a recall. 
Shares were up 2 percent at $74.05 in early trading, after surging more than 5 percent before the market opened. 
Sales at established stores jumped 9 percent in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, triple the average estimate of analysts for a 2.9 percent increase, according to Consensus Metrix.
The company's revenue grew 14 percent to $15.36 billion, beating estimates for $14.5 billion.
""The roughly $2 billion overall revenue increase speaks to the strength of Best Buy's brick-and-mortar footprint, as well as reinforces our view that consumers still value the store experience,"" said Moody's retail analyst Charlie O’Shea.
Best Buy has tried to turn itself around by matching e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN)'s low prices, closing underperforming stores, and improving customer service.
The performance continues to be a reversal for a company that had struggled with plunging sales and shrinking profit about six years ago as consumers browsed at brick-and-mortar stores but made purchases online, a practice called showrooming. 
Online sales jumped 17.9 percent in the U.S. from a year ago, accounting for $2.8 billion of business in the quarter, or about 20 percent of Best Buy's total revenue.
On Wednesday, the company said it would shut 250 small mobile phone stores in U.S. malls as it looked for ways to operate more profitably and turn around its business amid intense competition.
Best Buy expects to incur as much as $65 million in pretax charges from the closures, which could trim its earnings by between 14 cents and 17 cents a share in the first quarter of 2019.
The cost of implementing these changes is primarily related to terminating store leases, and the company expects that most of these charges will be recorded in the first quarter of 2019. 
The Richfield, Minnesota-based company's net income fell to $364 million, or $1.23 per share, in the quarter, from $607 million, or $1.91 per share, a year earlier, hurt by charges from the new U.S. tax reform. Excluding these charges, earnings were $2.42 per share.
Analysts had expected earnings of $2.04 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Best Buy said it expects comparable sales for the full fiscal year 2019 to be flat to 2 percent higher, and diluted earnings per share to grow between 9 percent to 13 percent helped by a lower tax rate.

It paid a one-time bonus of $1,000 to full-time store workers and corporate employees, and a $500 bonus to part-time store workers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) on Thursday reported strong comparable sales fueled by robust holiday-season demand for activewear and online growth and issued a 2018 earnings outlook that topped expectations, sending its shares higher in premarket trading.
The retailer has now had two quarters of same-store growth after six periods of declines in an industry-wide slump amid competition from online, fast-fashion and off-price sellers. It has been working to improve gross margins that are dented by shipping costs for digital orders. 
Kohl's same-store sales rose 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 27. Analysts on average had expected sales to rise 6.1 percent in stores open at least 12 months in the quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
It stood out against other department stores during a strong U.S. holiday shopping season thanks to  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Under Armour sales, digital growth, new customers and a focus on rolling out exclusive items more quickly and tailoring them by market. 
Shares were up 2.6 percent at $67.75 in premarket trading.
They had already run up more than 60 percent since early November, fueled partly by its previously reported November and December sales figures. 
Revenue of $6.78 billion slightly edged out analyst estimates and was up 9 percent from a year earlier.
Gross margin was 33.8 percent, compared to 33.4 percent during the same period a year earlier. 
Kohl's has embraced the so-called omnichannel approach to drive traffic and incremental sales by partnering with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to sell electronics and accept the online seller's returns in certain stores. 
It also benefits from a store base that is largely outside of malls, where foot traffic has plunged.
The retailer has melded its online and brick-and-mortar presence by offering buy-online, pick-up-in-store discounts for certain items. This helps lure customers to stores where they may make impulse buys, while cutting shipping costs and improving margins for the company.
Kohl's has also been shrinking the size of many locations to cut fixed costs and inventory needs and plans on leasing unused space to grocers or convenience stores to boost foot traffic.
Kohl's expects fiscal 2018 earnings per share of $4.95 to $5.45, on comparable sales growth of flat to 2 percent. Analysts estimate full-year earnings of about $4.72 a share. 
The company said gross margin should increase 5 to 10 basis points compared to 2017. 
Earnings per share in the quarter rose from the same period a year earlier to $1.99, excluding the impact of a U.S. tax overhaul and store closures. Excluding a state tax settlement EPS was $1.87. 

Analysts on average had forecast earnings of $1.77 per share.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Large investors looking to diversify beyond stocks and traditional fixed income will soon be able to trade assets tied to insurance liabilities covering potentially everything from hurricanes to floods and even cyber attacks.
Extraordinary Re, a startup focused on the reinsurance industry, plans to launch a new trading platform run by exchange operator Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) this summer that will let institutional investors buy and sell exposure to insurance risk, the company said on Thursday.
The privately backed company will create new products for the $90 billion insurance-linked securities (ILS) market and make it easier to participate in, Extraordinary Re Chief Executive Officer Will Dove said in an interview
The ILS market developed over the past couple of decades as a way for insurance companies to pass some of their risk associated with natural disasters - usually hurricanes and earthquakes - on to investors by issuing catastrophe bonds, or CAT bonds. If no catastrophe hits, the bonds pay out a percentage of the premiums by way of coupons. But if a disaster does occur, the insurance company can use the funds to pay claims to its policy holders.
Extraordinary Re will let insurance companies create ""liquid insurance contracts"" that will allow institutional investors to buy and sell shares of insurance liabilities on the cloud-based exchange built and operated by Nasdaq.
Investors will be able to create portfolios of liabilities on the platform using combinations of contracts, giving them a share of the insurance premiums, but also exposing them to potential losses if the underlying policies are triggered.
""These are very different from a CAT bond because they are really a share of a liability that can be reallocated between investors on the Extraordinary Re platform,"" Dove said.
""They don’t have a coupon, they don't have a final maturity date, rather they represent a participation in a reinsurance contract and that innovation is what allows us to be able to handle really any type of insurance and reinsurance risk,"" he said.
Part of the reason for the rapid growth of the insurance-linked securities market has been its lack of correlation to other markets, Dove said. When stocks and many other asset classes tanked during the financial crisis, CAT bonds were unaffected because they are triggered by natural disasters.
With its new contracts on Extraordinary Re will offer even more diversification, he said.

704,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 07:15AM ET</span>",Germany would not block suitable French pick for Airbus CEO: minister,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government would not oppose a suitable French candidate to replace Tom Enders as chief executive of European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) when his term expires in 2019, German Economy Minister Brigitte Zypries said on Thursday.
Zypries told reporters it would be difficult for Germany, which alongside France holds a stake in Europe's largest aerospace company, to block a French candidate after years of having Enders, a German, at the helm.
""The most important thing is that it is someone who is qualified,"" Zypries said, adding: ""The competition in America is not sleeping.""
Enders announced in December he would not seek a new mandate when his term expires in 2019.
Germany and France are the two single largest stakeholders in Airbus, with each holding just over 11 percent of the company's shares.
Enders told shareholders last month he still held the reins and sought to address concerns about continuity as a raft of industrial executives prepare to leave or retire from Airbus.
It remains unclear who will succeed Enders in 2019. Although Airbus officials insist that should not be an issue until later this year, industry sources call it a potential distraction.
The main internal candidate is Guillaume Faury, a French citizen and the former helicopter unit chief who recently replaced Ender's previous No. 2 Fabrice Bregier.
But the board is also expected to examine fresh blood such as  Thales  (PA:TCFP) CEO Patrice Caine, two industry sources have told Reuters.
Le Figaro newspaper has also identified former Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) chief Alexandre de Juniac, currently head of the International Air Transport Association, as a contender.

Some German company officials, including Airbus defense chief Dirk Hoke, have also been named as possible successors.

706,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 06:44AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Israel's El Al seeks international help to access Saudi airspace,"By Tova Cohen and Ari Rabinovitch
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel's flag carrier El Al has asked an airline industry lobby group to help it access Saudi Arabian airspace, so it can compete with Air India's (AIN.UL) planned route between India and Israel.
The request came in a letter on Wednesday from El Al's chief executive to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), in which he said he has also approached Israel's prime minister.
Saudi Arabia does not recognize Israel though there has been a thawing of the relationship between the U.S. allies, with a shared concern over Iranian influence in the region. Granting an Israeli airline access to its air space by lifting a 70-year-old ban, however, would mark a dramatic diplomatic shift.
The appeal is a response to plans revealed by Air India last month to begin direct flights to Tel Aviv which pass through Saudi airspace, a shorter route so far off-limits to all Israel-bound commercial planes. There has been no official announcement whether Air India has received permission to fly over Saudi soil for its proposed thrice-weekly flights.
El Al's CEO has now turned to the head of IATA, Alexandre de Juniac, saying he understood no such permission would be granted to Israeli jetliners and asking Juniac to step in to prevent ""an uneven playing field.""
""I am approaching you and kindly requesting IATA to intervene and to represent aviation industry's interest by advocating equal overfly rights for all carriers over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and opposing any form of discrimination,"" CEO Gonen Usishkin wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.
IATA's membership includes 280 airlines in 120 countries.
Usishkin said he has also requested help from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resolve the issue.
El Al has yet to receive a response.
El Al currently flies four weekly flights to Mumbai, but these take seven hours rather than five as they take a route south towards Ethiopia and then east to India, avoiding Saudi airspace. Shortening the route would also be a significant cost-cutter.
Air India has not received any communication yet from the aviation regulator, a company spokesman said when asked whether the airline had received permission to operate flights to Israel over the Saudi airspace.
The proposed India-Israel route is a result of strengthening ties between the two countries.

In his letter Usishkin, who became CEO two weeks ago, said Air India's flights are scheduled to begin on March 6, citing slot information from Israel's Airports Authority.

710,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 05:44AM ET</span>","Big pharma, big data: why drugmakers want your health records","By Ben Hirschler
LONDON (Reuters) - Drugmakers are racing to scoop up patient health records and strike deals with technology companies as big data analytics start to unlock a trove of information about how medicines perform in the real world.
Studying such real-world evidence offers manufacturers a powerful tool to prove the value of their drugs - something Roche (S:ROG) aims to leverage, for example, with last month's $2 billion purchase of Flatiron Health.
Real-world evidence involves collecting data outside traditional randomized clinical trials, the current gold standard for judging medicines, and interest in the field is ballooning.
Half of the world's 1,800 clinical studies involving real-world or real-life data since 2006 have been started in the last three years, with a record 300 last year, according to a Reuters analysis of the U.S. National Institutes of Health's clinicaltrials.gov website. 
Hot areas for such studies include cancer, heart disease and respiratory disorders.
Historically, it has been hard to get a handle on how drugs work in routine clinical practice but the rise of electronic medical records, databases of insurance claims, fitness wearables and even social media now offers a wealth of new data.
The ability to capture the experience of real-world patients, who represent a wider sample of society than the relatively narrow selection enrolled into traditional trials, is increasingly useful as medicine becomes more personalized.
However it also opens a new front in the debate about corporate access to personal data at a time when tech giants Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN) and Google's parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) are seeking to carve out a healthcare niche.
Some campaigners and academics worry such data will be used primarily as a commercial tool by drugmakers and may intrude upon patients' privacy. 
DRUGMAKERS DELVE
Learning from the experience of millions of patients provides granularity and is especially important in a disease like cancer, where doctors want to know if there is a greater benefit from using a certain drug in patients with highly specific tumor characteristics.
In the case of the Flatiron deal, Roche is acquiring a firm working with 265 U.S. community cancer clinics and six major academic research centers, making it a leading curator of oncology evidence. Roche, which already owns 12.6 percent of Flatiron, will pay $1.9 billion for the rest.
But interest in such real-world data goes far beyond cancer.
All the world's major drug companies now have departments focused on the use of real-world data across multiple diseases and several have completed scientific studies using the information to delve into key areas addressed by their drugs.
They include diabetes studies by AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and Sanofi (PA:SASY), joint research by  Pfizer  (N:PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (N:BMY) into stroke prevention, and a Takeda Pharmaceutical (T:4502) project in bowel disease.
""It's getting more expensive to do traditional clinical trial research, so industry is looking at ways it can achieve similar goals using routinely collected data,"" said Paul Taylor, a health informatics expert at University College London.
""The thing that has made all this possible is the increasing digitization of health records."" 
Significantly, the world's regulators are taking notice.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Scott Gottlieb - the gatekeeper to the world's biggest pharmaceutical market - believes more widespread use of real-world evidence (RWE) could cut drug development costs and help doctors make better medical choices.
Under the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA has been directed to evaluate the expanded use of RWE. ""As the breadth and reliability of RWE increases, so do opportunities for FDA to also make use of this information,"" Gottlieb said in a speech last September.
The European Medicines Agency, too, is studying ways to use RWE in its decision making. 
(GRAPHIC: Drug research gets real - http://tmsnrt.rs/2otRk8g) 
WHOSE DATA IS IT ANYWAY?
But the growth of real-world evidence also raises questions about data access and patient privacy, as Britain's National Health Service (NHS) - a uniquely comprehensive source of healthcare data - has found to its cost.
An ambitious scheme to pool anonymized NHS patient data for both academic and commercial use had to be scrapped in 2016 after protests from both patients and doctors. 
And last year a British hospital trust was rapped by the Information Commissioner's Office for misusing data, after it passed on personal information of around 1.6 million patients to artificial-intelligence firm Google DeepMind.
Sam Smith, a campaigner for medical data privacy at Britain's MedConfidential, is concerned drugmakers' RWE studies are just a cover for marketing. ""How much of this is really for scientific discovery and how much is it about boosting profits by getting one product used instead of another?""
Some academics also worry RWE studies could be susceptible to ""data dredging"", where multiple analyses are conducted until one gives the hoped-for result.
AstraZeneca's head of innovative medicines Mene Pangalos, whose company has struck several deals with tech start-ups and patient groups to gather real-world data, acknowledges ensuring privacy and scientific rigor is a challenge.
""It's a real problem but I don't think it's insurmountable,"" he told Reuters. 
""As people get more comfortable with real-world evidence studies I think it will be much more widely used. I would like to see a world where real-world data can be used to help change drug labels and be used much more aggressively than it is today."" 
NEXT FRONTIER
Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan believes data is the next frontier for drugmakers and he is betting that the Swiss group's leadership in both cancer medicine and diagnostics will put it in pole position.
""There's an opportunity for us to have a strategic advantage by bringing together diagnostics and pharma with data management. This triangle is almost impossible for anybody else to copy,"" he said in a December interview.
Still, even Roche cannot work alone in this new world.
""You can have a big debate about whose data it is - the patient's, the government's, the insurer's - but one thing for sure is the pharmaceutical company does not own it. So there's no choice but to do partnerships,"" Schwan said.
With Apple's latest iPhone update including a new feature allowing users to view their medical records, Amazon teaming with Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) and JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) on a new healthcare company, and numerous start-ups flooding in, the partnering opportunities are plentiful.

""You are going to see more deals,"" said Susan Garfield, a partner in EY's life sciences advisory practice. ""Data already has tremendous value and it is going to have increasing value in future. The question is who is going to own and capture it.""

714,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 11:06AM ET</span>","For CSX, more job and train cuts in post-Harrison era","By Eric M. Johnson
(Reuters) - U.S. railroad operator CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX) said on Thursday at its first investor day since the death of former Chief Executive Hunter Harrison that more cuts to jobs, rail cars and locomotives were key to its three-year plan for boosting profitability and streamlining operations.
Harrison, cherished by investors for leading turnarounds of Canada's two major railroads, died in December just eight months into a dramatic restructuring campaign that included slashing jobs, shutting eight rail yards, mothballing locomotives and running trains on tight schedules rather than based on customer needs.
CSX shares, up about 1 percent in early Thursday trade, have surged about 50 percent since January 2017 and about 12 percent since March 2017 when Harrison took over as CEO following a high-stakes push by activist investor Paul Hilal of investment fund Mantle Ridge LP.
But the overhaul has triggered persistent service delays and disruptions and raised costs for many shippers, and drawn scrutiny from federal regulators. 
The new CEO, Jim Foote, and his revamped management team reaffirmed that it would substantially lower its operating ratio - a closely watched measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue – to 60 percent by 2020 from 67.9 percent at year-end 2017. 
""What are we here for? To make money,"" Foote told investors at a conference in New York. ""What are we trying to do? Drive efficiency, improve the network, improve the quality of our service, which will reduce our costs."" 
The Jacksonville, Florida-based railroad, the third-largest in the U.S., said it would cut an estimated 2,200 jobs by the end of 2018 and another 4,000 in 2020. 
It also plans to decrease locomotives in service by up to 20 percent by 2020, while also reducing the number of rail cars it uses by more than 20 percent in the same time period.
Several shippers have told Reuters that service has been steadily improving from a nadir last summer, although companies such as U.S. agricultural firm Cargill Inc and coal company Murray Energy Corp are still struggling with crew and rail car shortages.
CSX said it expects compound annual revenue growth of 4 percent in 2019 and 2020, driven by rising freight volumes and higher pricing.

CSX also said it could raise $800 million from selling off rail lines and real estate and would spend $4.8 billion on capital like infrastructure and technology from 2018 through 2020.

LONDON (Reuters) - More than 20 major international institutions chose to set up all or part of their activities in Luxembourg last year, the country's financial development agency said on Thursday, linking the decisions to Britain's move to leave the European Union.
The tiny EU-member state is one of several countries vying for a slice of Britain's lucrative financial services sector as slow progress in its talks to exit the bloc prompts firms to move ahead with contingency plans to secure EU market access.
During 2017, five banks including Citibank, JP Morgan and China Everbright; more than a dozen global asset managers including Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Carlyle; and 10 global insurance companies decided to establish or expand their presence in the duchy, Luxembourg For Finance said in a statement.
""Following the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, last year alone over twenty top-ranked international institutions chose Luxembourg to set up all or part of their activities and benefit from the specialization that exists within the Luxembourg financial ecosystem,"" it said in a statement. 
A total of 139 banks from 28 countries are based in Luxembourg, it added, with a focus on investment management, private banking, and the business and trade finance sectors.

""Luxembourg is expecting further announcements from businesses over the coming months, whether in the insurance, fund management, banking or fintech sectors,"" it said.

Adidas had opposed Belgian company Shoe Branding Europe's application for two EU trademarks for two parallel stripes on shoes as it was too similar to its own iconic three-stripe design.

The EUIPO refused registration in separate decisions in 2015 and 2016. The Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, on Thursday affirmed the EUIPO's decisions, saying that the design Shoe Branding had proposed would take unfair advantage of Adidas’ reputation and that it had not demonstrated due cause for its use.

721,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 04:23AM ET</span>",New graduates flock to job fair as China's spring hiring spree begins,"By Elias Glenn
SHIJIAZHUANG, China (Reuters) - Thousands of job seekers and hundreds of companies gathered on the grounds of the old train station in the northern Chinese city of Shijiazhuang this week to mark the start of the traditionally busy hiring season. 
In this city of 10 million known for smoggy skies and heavy industry, crowds of job hunters browsed information about positions at firms ranging from steel parts makers to environmental protection companies. 
""I've been urgently looking for a new job since the holiday ended a few days ago,"" said Wang Xinjie, who works at auto manufacturer Great Wall Motor (SS:601633) in nearby Baoding.
""I want to find a new job with a higher salary and more opportunity for growth,"" he added in remarks that were echoed by many at the fair, which was held after the long Lunar New Year holidays. 
China's labor market has been remarkably resilient over the last two years despite a campaign to shutter outdated industrial plants and as low-end exporters move offshore to cheaper countries in South and Southeast Asia. 
Restructuring in the industrial sector was expected to lead to millions of layoffs, including in Hebei, China's largest steel producing province where Shijiazhuang is located, but there have been few signs of large-scale unemployment. 
The large state firms that dominate heavy industry have often kept redundant workers on their payrolls, though sometimes at lower salaries. And local governments have stepped in to offer training and redeployment services in a bid to avoid a rise in unemployment. 
The central government has funneled significant funds into supporting the industrial sector, including a new 350 billion yuan ($55.2 billion) fund to help restructure state enterprises, and 100 billion yuan to finance layoffs in the coal and steel sector. Both initiatives were announced in 2016. 
A rebound in the economy has also helped. A housing boom and a jump in infrastructure investment last year helped spark a dramatic turnaround in China's industrial sector.
And with winter pollution curbs set to expire this month, steel producers are eager to ramp up production to take advantage of high prices and strong demand.
A representative from Shijiazhuang steel-focused conglomerate Hebei Jingye Group said at the job fair that the company was recruiting a large number of new staff this year. 
Fast-growing consumer services and technology industries have also helped pick up the slack in job growth. 
Government officials boast that 13.51 million new jobs were created in China last year, and a tight labor market in some sectors have driven salaries up significantly. 
But some companies say hiring has become more difficult as graduates demand more in terms of salary and types of jobs. 
""Young people either want to be their own boss and start their own business, or they lack independence to the point that their parents accompany them to the job fair,"" said Wang Yandong, a representative of Hebei Hengxin Wire Mesh Manufacturing.
The government last month pledged to roll out more job growth measures this year, though companies often say it's not easy to find candidates with the right skills.
Nogeteks Ltd, a local startup that sells a chemical solution to control dust at construction sites, on Sunday was advertising a salary of 2,500 yuan ($395.07) to 3,000 yuan a month for an accountant with a few years of work experience. 
While many job seekers said they were just browsing, Wang Xinjie, the Great Wall Motor technician, saw some real results.
He got an offer to join Lizhong Wheel Group in Baoding with a salary increase of about 15 percent to 4,000 yuan a month, he said by text after the fair.
China says its urban-registered jobless rate fell to 3.9 percent in 2017 - the lowest since 2002. 
Many analysts say, however, that the official data is an unreliable indicator of employment conditions, as it measures only employment in urban areas and doesn't take into account millions of migrant workers.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has pledged a six-year, $180 billion infrastructure overhaul of aging roads, railways, ports and airports that have become a logistical headache in one of the fastest growing economies in Asia.
The proposal, by Megawide's joint venture with India's  GMR Infrastructure  Ltd (NS:GMRI), would be cheaper than the one put forward by seven of the Philippines' largest conglomerates last month to modernize and more than triple the capacity of the Manila airport.
The plan to decongest and rehabilitate the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), the country's main gateway, would entail a $3 billion investment over six years, Megawide said in a disclosure to the stock exchange regulator. ""It is vital to immediately decongest NAIA and maximize its potential in order to sustainably support the air traffic needs of the greater capital region,"" said Louie Ferrer, a representative of the GMR Megawide consortium. The proposed investment would increase aircraft capacity by up to 35 percent, double terminal space and more than double its capacity to 72 million passengers a year, Megawide said. GMR Megawide manages an airport in central Philippines, while GMR operates the New Delhi and Istanbul airports.

726,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",Ex-BlackRock Manager Sees 4% U.S. Yield on Policy Tightening,"(Bloomberg) -- A former bond manager at BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). says the yield on 10-year Treasuries may hit 4 percent by the end of this year, pitting him against many on Wall Street who expect a shallower sell-off in bonds.
“We are going back to the world as we knew it before the crisis,” said Stephen Miller, now an investment consultant for Grant Samuel Funds Management in Sydney.
Bond investors are underestimating the pace of monetary policy tightening needed at a time of broad global economic growth and a return of developed economy inflation to levels that will be much closer to central bank targets, said Miller, who spent 14 years at BlackRock, where he headed its fixed-income team in Australia. 
As markets adjust to that environment in a U.S. economy with robust corporate profits, the 10-year yield will rise to between 3.5 percent and 4 percent by the end of 2018 as central-bank stimulus is continually wound down, he said. Ten-year Treasuries traded with a yield of just under 2.9 percent on Thursday.
Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell signaled this week that stronger growth could prompt policy makers to accelerate the pace of tightening this year, triggering losses in Treasuries. Fed funds futures contracts now price in close to three full rate increases this year, up from 2.8 hikes Monday.
As the U.S. economy exits the era of low rates and loose monetary policy, investors need to use a 2 percent nominal growth and 2 percent inflation level as their working assumption for investing, Miller said.
Equity investors need not worry, he added. While volatility will be higher than what investors have become accustomed to in recent years, the S&P 500 Index can still grind out mid-single digit returns this year even as the bond rout deepens.
“If bond yields are contained to that 3.5 to 4 percent range, I don’t see that presaging undue difficulty for equity returns,” he said. “It might be a little bit of a wild ride.”
Miller began work earlier this year at Grant Samuel, a boutique asset manager that has about A$6.5 billion ($5 billion) in funds under management. It’s owned by Canada’s CI Financial Corp. Everything he heard from Jerome Powell this week reinforced his view that the ramp up in bond yields will continue, Miller said.
“He’s thinking that we may need to tighten more than three times this year and if we need to do that, that’s not bad news,” Miller said. “That is a return to normality.”

The job cuts would be part of the group's ""weight-loss"" program for this year, the news and analytics provider reported.
The downsizing also would include staff reductions from the aviation-to-financial services conglomerate's units, whose controlling stakes would be sold to a third party, REDD reported, without identifying those units.
A person familiar with HNA Group's restructuring process said no such job cuts were planned. HNA Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In recent months, HNA has been racing to alleviate severe financial strain on it following a $50 billion acquisition spree over the past two years, which has sparked scrutiny of its opaque ownership and use of leverage.
The group has amassed an estimated $476 million bill with a state-run aviation fuel company, Reuters reported on Wednesday, underscoring how a deepening cash crunch is plaguing core operations at the conglomerate.
HNA is also seeking to restructure its far-flung operations, while raising cash by selling equity and prime real estate assets. Among its recent divestments are a Sydney office tower and two plots of land in Hong Kong.

REDD reported that as part of the workforce restructuring about 100,000 jobs could be cut this year, a quarter of the group's more than 400,000 staff. HNA had informed its Hainan-based staff about the cuts, two of the five people told REDD.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Holdings plans to buy back $300 million worth of its own shares, the company said on Wednesday after Dutch regulators threw up roadblocks that prevented billionaire investor William Ackman from making a tender offer himself.
In January, Ackman, who runs hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, announced plans for a $300 million infusion into the publicly traded company, which is listed in Amsterdam and London.
The move was aimed at reducing the discount to the net asset value at which PSH's public shares are currently trading.
Now the company itself not Ackman will be buying the shares.
""We believe that a tender offer made directly by the company is now appropriate in order to address the continuing imbalance between supply and demand for the public shares,"" Anne Farlow, Pershing Square Holdings' chair said in a statement.
After the tender is completed, Ackman and senior associates at his New York-based Pershing Square Capital Management would be able to buy shares in the open market.
Should he and others spend the $300 million they had initially earmarked in January, the total $600 million would represent more than 20 percent of the market capitalization of Pershing Square Holdings that is currently not owned by affiliates of the hedge fund.
Ackman listed the fund in Amsterdam four years ago as a way to create permanent capital for his hedge fund -- investors can sell only if there is another buyer. This has helped stabilize capital at the $9 billion firm in the last years as investors, including pension funds, have pulled money out when the fund suffered double digit losses in 2015 and 2016.

Chairman Paul Brough said he had ""no magic pill"" for investors facing hefty losses under a planned restructuring that would halve Noble’s $3.5 billion debt. He warned that no deal with a strategic investor was likely before the restructuring is completed, and that the alternative to the deal was a court-driven insolvency process that would be ""very damaging indeed"".
""What we’re focused on is trying to get all of the parties over the line,"" Brough said on a call. ""I do accept that it requires an allocation of some pain and discomfort, but I’m afraid that there’s no magic pill to solve it.""
The company that was once Asia’s largest commodity trader has been brought to the brink of collapse after a three-year crisis marked by losses and writedowns. In annual results on Wednesday, its auditor Ernst & Young LLP pointed to the trader’s massive loss, bank debt and negative net assets as indicating the “existence of material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.”
A preliminary deal struck by the company and a group of large hedge fund creditors last month has encountered resistance from some bondholders and shareholders. In a fresh blow just hours before the earnings, a group of perpetual bondholders said they’d fight the plan.
The deal, which Noble says would allow it to continue operating, would hand the lion’s share of the company’s remaining value to creditors willing to participate in a new trade finance facility. That’ll include hedge funds from the so-called ad hoc group that’s underwriting the facility. What’s more, Noble’s management will receive an equity stake of as much as 20 percent.

“It’s wholly unclear to me why unsecured creditors are giving this team the chance to vaporize their capital all over again,” said Alex Turnbull, Singapore-based managing partner at Keshik Capital Pte. ""How bad could this business be with new management? The current team could catch fire in a swimming pool.""
Noble is still racing to agree the final terms of the deal with the ad-hoc group, something Brough said he hoped to achieve in the next few days or weeks.
“Time is of the essence, we appreciate that,” Brough said. Noble’s advisers have described the deal as ""probably the most complex restructuring ever undertaken in Asia"", he added.
Bond Coupons
He declined to say whether Noble would pay a coupon on its 2022 bond or repay its 2018 bond, both of which are due in March. Noble paid a coupon on its 2020 bond last month ""in order to maintain our franchise"", Brough said.
Noble executives and their rivals at other traders expect that some key counterparties could walk away from long-term contracts with the company in the event of a restructuring or default, putting further strain on the business, Bloomberg reported in November.
Noble’s downfall was triggered in February 2015 when an unknown analyst group called Iceberg Research published scathing critiques of the company’s accounting, warning some earnings wouldn’t materialize and the trader would be short on cash to settle debts.
While Noble has consistently dismissed the criticism, much of what Iceberg flagged has since come to pass and the company’s market value has collapsed amid asset sales, downgrades and vast losses. The trader is now worth about $159 million compared with more than $10 billion in 2010. On Thursday, the shares fell as much as 8.1 percent, dropping for a sixth day.
Annual Loss
The full-year loss included $1.05 billion from operations the company has sold as it shrinks to survive, as well as $3.2 billion in exceptional items from businesses that remain, according to the statement. Cash and equivalents fell to $492 million at end-December, from $1.2 billion a year earlier.
Under the restructuring plan, which is backed by some senior creditors, about half of the Hong Kong-based company’s $3.5 billion debt will be switched into new equity, while perpetual bondholders are being offered just a few cents on the dollar. All existing shareholders will get a 10 percent holding, and management could own as much as 20 percent.
The group of perpetual bondholders resisting the push have hired Latham & Watkins LLP to negotiate a better deal, according to a statement earlier on Wednesday. Separately, one of the top shareholders, Goldilocks Investment Co., has complained of massive dilution, called the losses “extremely shocking”, and is appealing for other investors to fight.

738,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 12:37PM ET</span>","Dollar rises, yields dip as market mulls Fed speeches","By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose to a six-week high on Thursday on solid U.S. economic data, but remarks by the new Federal Reserve chief that there no evidence of an overheating economy pushed bond yields lower even as stocks wavered on Wall Street.
In his second testimony in Congress this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell also told the Senate Banking Committee that the U.S. central bank did not see any evidence of a decisive advance in wages.
The remarks tempered market concerns from his testimony on Tuesday that sparked fears about a quicker pace of inflation.
Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Management in Zurich, said there was a lack of conviction in the market as U.S. stocks traded above and below break-even and bond yields pulled back from a recent march higher.
Trading was algorithmic or related to positioning, he said, as the market was pulled by inflation concerns on the one hand and sharply higher expectations for earnings growth that strong global growth was driving.
""I don't think that there are very many people who take a fundamental view on markets who are changing their views much. They're all sitting back and basically watching but not acting,"" Hatheway said.
The dollar index, tracking the U.S. unit against a basket of major currencies, was flat, with the euro up 0.16 percent to $1.2212. The Japanese yen weakened 0.25 percent versus the greenback at 106.97 per dollar.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.25 percent, but the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 1.26 percent to close at a provisional 516.59.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 46.77 points, or 0.19 percent, to 24,982.43. The S&P 500 lost 3.23 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,710.6 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 5.92 points, or 0.08 percent, to 7,267.09.
Comments by New York Fed President William Dudley stoked the embers of rate-hike fears during remarks in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where he said four rate hikes - or one more than the Fed has forecast this year - would be gradual.
The gap between short-dated U.S. borrowing costs and those in Germany was at its widest in over 20 years as the monetary policy outlooks by the Fed and European Central Bank for the two regions diverged.
U.S. consumer prices increased in January as a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, but a survey showed the euro zone's factory boom slowed a little further in February, pressuring euro zone yields lower.
""In the U.S. we have at least three rate hikes this year, but in the euro zone, there was some exaggeration about where inflation was heading so that is now being priced out and yields are moving to the downside,"" said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz.
Oil fell more than 1 percent, hitting two-week lows on pressure from a strong dollar and worries that surging U.S. crude output might thwart efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to drain global supply.
U.S. crude fell 57 cents to $61.07 per barrel and Brent was last at $63.98, down 75 cents on the day.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 07:37PM ET</span>",Best Buy plans to shut 250 small U.S. mobile phone stores,"By Nandita Bose
(Reuters) -  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY), the No. 1 U.S. consumer electronics retailer, on Wednesday said it will shut 250 small mobile phone stores in U.S. malls as it looks for ways to operate more profitably and turn around its business amid intense competition.
The stores, which contributed just over 1 percent to the company's overall revenue and 1 percent to its overall square footage, will be shut effective May 31. 
The mobile stores are each about 1,400 square feet (130 sq meters) while a typical Best Buy store occupies about 40,000 square feet (3,716 sq meters). 
The Minneapolis-based retailer said it will continue to sell mobile phones through its 1,000 U.S. big box stores and online. The decision does not impact the company's 52 mobile stores in Canada.
Best Buy began opening these stores more than a decade ago, before Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) iPhone was launched and when margins in the business were high, Best Buy Chief Executive Hubert Joly told employees in a letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.
""Fast forward to 2018 and the mobile phone business has matured, margins have compressed and the cost of operations in our mobile standalone stores is higher than in our big box stores,"" Joly said.
The company declined to disclose how many employees will be affected by the decision. 
The letter said Best Buy will help employees look for other jobs within the company over three months. It will offer severance to those who leave after May 31 and help them with an external job search.
About six years ago, Best Buy struggled with plunging sales and shrinking profit as consumers browsed at brick-and-mortar stores but made purchases online, a practice called showrooming.
Since then the company has tried to turn itself around by closing underperforming stores, improving customer service and competing with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) by matching the online retailer's low prices.
Those efforts have helped Best Buy grow comparable sales at stores open at least a year in six of the past eight quarters. The company reports fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.

Joly said in the letter he felt confident about retaining customers and transitioning them to the company's larger stores and website, adding 85 percent of Best Buy's mobile stores are within three miles (4.8 km) of one of its big box stores.

The California-based firm TrimTabs, which tracks corporate buybacks, said the value of buyback programs announced in February alone surged to $153.7 billion from $59.9 billion in January, smashing a previous monthly record of $133 billion in April 2015. 
""Activity has certainly accelerated. Buybacks increased for five consecutive months beginning in July 2017 and have exploded in February,"" said TrimTabs analyst Winston Chua.
""If the pace keeps up, this year’s volume will smash totals from all other previous years going back more than a decade,"" he added. 
Meanwhile, U.S. Senate Democrats said in a separate report that $209 billion worth of U.S. corporate share buybacks have been announced since Jan. 5, claiming the figure shows that the Republican tax overhaul largely benefits corporations, corporate executives and wealthy shareholders.
Long a flash point for partisan disagreement in Washington, the tax cuts are expected to play a major role in Nov. 6 congressional mid-term elections, which will determine whether Republicans can maintain their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives. 
Republicans including President Donald Trump, who signed tax legislation into law in December, have joined U.S. companies in promoting a recent spate of bonuses, pay raises and other benefits as evidence that the tax overhaul is benefiting workers. 
A spokesman for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats are losing the argument on taxes and dismissed the buyback report as a desperate attempt to change the subject.

The report by Senate Democrats spans more than 30 buyback programs announced by companies from a range of industries including banking, energy, manufacturing, retailing and technology.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of online crafts retailer  Etsy Inc  (O:ETSY) jumped 20.4 percent on Wednesday after it reported fourth-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations, showing signs of a turnaround since it brought on a new chief executive last year.
The shares rose as high as $26.23, their highest level since April 2015, the month Etsy went public, before closing at $25.31.
After Tuesday's market close, Etsy reported earnings per share of 36 cents on a GAAP basis. With 17 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $136.3 million in revenue, it beat the average analyst estimate of 8 cents in earnings per share on $132.6 million in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Gross merchandise sales grew to $1.02 billion, up 17.8 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016.
For 2018, the company projected growth of 14 to 16 percent in gross merchandise sales and revenue growth of 21 to 23 percent, also topping analysts' expectations.
In every quarter since Chief Executive Josh Silverman joined Etsy in May, the company has beaten average analyst estimates. It missed estimates in the four quarters prior to his arrival. Etsy's shares rose 73.6 percent in 2017.
""The management team's initiatives and focus on improving (gross merchandise sales) are clearly having a positive impact,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Dylan Haber wrote in a research note.
Silverman came to Etsy amid concerns about slowing growth, poor functionality of the company's website and the specter of competition from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which launched a marketplace for handmade goods in 2015. Hedge fund Black-and-White Capital had called upon the company to explore a sale.
Etsy's most recent results, along with its stock performance on Wednesday, suggests that it is addressing those concerns, said Thomas Forte, an analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.
""There was fair investor skepticism on the name,"" Forte said. ""The new management has come in and done a really good job. They're proving skeptics wrong.""
Etsy has improved its website's search function and uses artificial intelligence to provide better product recommendations for customers. In 2017 the company ran holiday promotions for the first time.
Amazon's entrance into the crafts marketplace has had little impact on Etsy's performance thus far, Forte said.
""I think it has the best business model in the consumer tech space,"" he said. ""And the good news is that all of the changes it's making are sustainable.""

763,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",Options traders lost big from tweak in short volatility ETPs: strategists,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Options traders suffered big losses due to recent changes in the investment objective of ProShare Capital Management LLC's two exchange traded funds that track near-term equity volatility futures, derivatives strategists said on Wednesday.
Traders who owned options on ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (P:SVXY) and ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (P:UVXY) have lost at least $100 million in premiums, according to Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy at Macro Risk Advisors in New York.
""It's obviously a one-time effect but it is pretty unprecedented,"" Chintawongvanich said.
The losses followed ProShares' announcement on Monday that it was tweaking the investment objectives of the funds to reduce their target exposure to the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index (SPVXSPID).
ProShare has declined to comment beyond its statement.
Starting at the close of regular trading on Tuesday, the Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) now seeks to rise 1 percent when the index it tracks declines by 2 percent, compared with its earlier tracking ratio of a negative one-to-one.
Similarly, the Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY) now aims to gain 1.5 percent, instead of 2 percent, when the index it tracks increases by 1 percent.
The adjustments reduce the funds' reactivity to changes in volatility at a time when these types of products have drawn regulators' scrutiny.
Reducing these funds' reaction to volatility, however, was bad news for anyone who owned options on them when ProShares announced the change. The implied volatility, an options-based measure of how much the securities are expected to move in the future, slumped sharply on Tuesday.
""I think they caught anybody holding these things, in particular options holders, completely flat-footed,"" said Lincoln Edwards, principal at Austin-based Houndstooth Capital Management.
On Wednesday, the 30-day implied volatility on SVXY was at 42.47 down from 75 percent on Monday, before the change to the fund's investment approach.
SVXY and UVXY options will not be adjusted for the ProShares fund changes, equity derivatives clearing organization, the OCC, said in a memo on Tuesday.
""If you were long options on SVXY or UVXY, you lost money,"" said Chintawongvanich.
The sharp losses also raised questions about the advisability of trading in options on these products, market participants said.
""We were not holding options on these things two days ago and that's purely a miracle, because we trade them routinely,"" said Houndstooth's Edwards.
""It makes the options on these things borderline untradable,"" he said.
It is likely that retail players took the worst hit, said Stuart John Barton, portfolio manager at Invest In Vol, a volatility-focused registered investment advisor in Stamford, Connecticut.
""I think retail players are generally long options. It's the long options positions that got hurt,"" he said.

764,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 04:02PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com – Here’s a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. The Perfect Storm Coming Gold's Way?
A raft of market-moving data which includes a key inflation report is set to get the first day of March underway Thursday, while Fed chair Jerome Powell's appearance will likely dominate direction as was the case Tuesday.
Market participants are likely to securitize Powell’s testimony before a Senate Panel Thursday at 10:00 a.m. ET as his seemingly hawkish comments Tuesday on both inflation and economic growth sent bond yields and the dollar soaring, leaving gold nursing sizable losses.
Powell’s testimony will be sandwiched between top-tier economic data on inflation, labor, manufacturing and consumer spending.
The Core Price Consumer Expenditure (PCE) Index – the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation – is expected to remain unchanged at 1.5% in January year-on-year. This will garner added attention amid growing expectations for four rate hikes this year.
Economist forecast the U.S. ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index to show a reading of 59 for February, broadly in line with the reading seen January.
The Labor department releases its weekly count of the  number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended Feb 23.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is expected to have risen 0.2% last month compared to a 0.4% jump in December.
The Federal Reserve’s beige book, a report that includes anecdotal evidence on the health of the US economy from 12 regions will also be closely watched for any subtle change in commentary on inflation following hawkish language seen in the Fed’s January meeting minutes.
2. Manufacturing, Housing To Steady Sterling?
Economists forecast Nationwide HPI data to show house prices rose 0.2% in February, well below the 0.6% growth seen in the prior month, while house prices growth on an annual basis is expected to fall to 2.6%.
The UK manufacturing PMI for February is expected to have eased to 55.1 from 55.3 in the previous month.
The update on manufacturing and housing comes at a time when Brexit-related uncertainty continues to pressure sterling after UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, rejected the EU’s proposal of a “common regulatory area” across Ireland if other solutions to avoid a hard border fail.
Brexit commentary is expected to dominate moves in sterling throughout the week in the run up to May’s speech Friday, when the UK Prime Minister is expected to outline a plan for a new post-Brexit relationship with the EU.
GBP/USD fell 1.02% to $1.3767.
3. Yen Watch: Japan Inflation In Focus 
Japan’s core consumer-price index is expected to show a 0.8% rise in January from a year earlier, down from the 0.9% increase seen in December.
Any sign of a wobble in inflation could scale back investor expectations that the Bank of Japan is nearing the end of its ultra-loose monetary policy measures after central bank’s recent moves to trim its long-term bond purchases.
USD/JPY fell 0.61% to Y106.69. Yet dollar strength against the yen is expected to prevail, according to Action Economics.
“Given the freshened US rate outlook following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments on Tuesday, and ongoing hints from the Bank of Japan that stimulus will remain in vogue for the foreseeable future, USD-JPY dip buying may remain in favor,” Action Economics said."
765,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 06:43AM ET</span>",BlackRock says outside commentaries on index funds could pose risk,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, on Wednesday said that commentary by third parties suggesting possible adverse impacts from the growth in index investing could pose a risk to its business.
""As a leader in the index investing and asset management industry, BlackRock has been the subject of third-party commentary citing concerns about the growth of index investing,"" the company said in a new risk disclosure its annual report, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
""If the conclusions advanced by such commentators were to gain traction or result in the enactment of policy measures that place limits on asset managers, BlackRock's business operations, reputation or financial condition may be adversely affected,"" it said.
A spokesperson for BlackRock said, ""Similar to many other public companies we take a conservative approach in disclosing 'risk factors' to shareholders. The dialogue around this topic is still extremely preliminary.""
Most publicly traded U.S. companies are required to file annual 10-K reports with securities regulators, disclosing among other details their most essential risks in plain language.
Criticism of index investing is not new, but BlackRock's highlighting a particular thread of concern as a primary risk factor in this way is. The company manages $1.8 trillion in iShares-brand exchange-traded funds (ETFs), most of which track an index, and another $2.4 trillion in non-ETF index funds.
BlackRock zeroed in on one argument about index investing that says index funds' ""common ownership"" of several companies in a single market segment reduces competition between those companies, imposing a cost on society that may need to be regulated. The asset management company and other researchers have disputed academic studies coming to that conclusion.

BlackRock also referenced commentary about the risk of index investing ""to distort investment flows, create stock price bubbles, or conversely, exacerbate a decline in market prices.""

766,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 04:12PM ET</span>","Verizon, Straight Path pay $614 million civil penalty to U.S. FCC: statement","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ) and its Straight Path Communications Inc unit paid a $614 million civil penalty as part of a January 2017 settlement with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the agency said on Wednesday.
The telecommunications regulator said the settlement resolved an investigation into allegations that Straight Path failed to use the spectrum it was awarded, and in doing so violated the FCC's rules in connection with approximately 1,000 licenses. 
The settlement required Straight Path to sell those licenses and remit 20 percent of the overall proceeds. Verizon said on Wednesday it had completed its $3.1 billion acquisition of the company it announced in May 2017. The settlement represents the largest civil penalty paid to resolve an FCC investigation.
A Verizon spokesman declined to comment. The settlement resolved conduct from before Verizon's announced acquisition.
The sales proceeds does not include a separate $15 million penalty that Straight Path paid to the FCC in January 2017.
The licenses are important to emerging 5G technology that will allow for much faster wireless networks and could usher in advances like remote surgical procedures and self-driving vehicles.
The FCC said in January 2017 that Straight Path was ""squatting on spectrum licenses"" and that was ""fundamentally inconsistent with the public good."" The FCC probe was prompted by allegations of fraud in November 2015 by an anonymous short seller of the company's stock, Reuters reported earlier.

Verizon outbid AT&T Inc (N:T), which made a bid to buy Straight Path in April 2017 valued at $1.6 billion. With the completion of Verizon's acquisition of Straight Path, the company's shares were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue told an agriculture conference on Wednesday that he and President Donald Trump support the country's biofuels policy, and that any reports to the contrary are ""fake news.""
Perdue made the comments a day after Trump hosted a meeting with Cabinet officials and senators to discuss potential changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard to help refiners who say they are struggling under the program. The RFS requires refiners to blend biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation's fuel.
That meeting yielded no deal.
""I can tell you Trump stands with corn farmers, biofuel farmers and the RFS,"" Perdue told an audience at the Commodity Classic in Anaheim, California, according to a recording heard by Reuters. ""I stand with him and with you.""
He said media reports that the administration does not support the RFS are ""fake news."" ""I will not support any policy that diminishes demand, undermines the RFS or is harmful to agricultural producers,"" Perdue said.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that Perdue made the comments.
Trump's meeting on Tuesday reflected rising concern in the White House over the current state of the RFS, which has increasingly divided two of Trump's most important constituencies: the energy industry and rural farmers.
A refining company in Pennsylvania, a state that often plays a key role deciding the outcome in national elections, last month blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy. This bolstered charges by the industry that the RFS is unfair and costly.
The White House meeting was held at the request of Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and was intended to get Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, both Republican senators from the corn state Iowa, to accept significant changes to the program aimed at providing financial relief to refiners.
The senators said on Tuesday they were asked to support placing price caps at the center of the program in exchange for greater use of higher-ethanol blended gasoline. The administration was also considering allowing exported ethanol to qualify for credits under the program, the senators said.
The senators said the proposals would gut the program and attempt to solve a problem - high costs for refiners - that does not exist. 
Perdue offered a different perceptive of the meeting, describing it more as a listening session than a negotiation. 
""He listened to both sides and told senators Grassley and Ernst that he will be strong for farmers and maintain the RFS,"" Grassley said.

The White House is expected to hold another meeting on Thursday with merchant refiners and biofuel groups, though a full list of participants was not immediately known.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 01, 2018 07:15AM ET</span>","Spotify plans to list shares, fend off Apple and Amazon","(In Feb. 28 story, corrects to ""$22.6 billion"" from ""$22.5 billion"" and to ""177 million"" from ""178 billion"" in paragraph 28)
By Stephen Nellis and Nivedita Bhattacharjee
(Reuters) - Music streaming service Spotify on Wednesday filed for a direct listing of its shares, laying out financial data for the first time that cheered some analysts but led others to question how it could turn a profit from its growing subscriber base.
Spotify, which wants to trade as SPOT on the New York Stock Exchange, is taking an unusual path to the U.S. public markets, with a direct listing that will let investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering. 
Because the company will not issue any new shares, it did not specify a listing price. Based on private transactions, it is valued at roughly $19 billion, according to Reuters calculations.
Spotify, launched in 2008 and available in more than 60 countries, is the biggest music streaming company in the world and counts services from Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google as its main rivals.
RISING SALES, COSTS IN CHECK
In the filing, Spotify laid out detailed financial data for the first time, showing rising revenue and relatively steady operating costs, which analysts took as a positive.
Revenue rose 39 percent to 4.09 billion euros ($4.99 billion) in 2017, from 2.95 billion euros a year earlier. Its operating loss widened to 378 million euros in 2017 from 349 million euros.
Its net loss ballooned 129 percent in 2017, driven mostly by financing costs related to a 2016 deal in which Sweden-based Spotify raised $1 billion in debt that would convert to shares upon an initial public offering.
""The revenue continues to grow but in particular their costs are growing slower than revenue, which is exactly what you expect in a business like this,"" said Jay Ritter, an expert in initial public offerings and professor at the University of Florida.
Spotify compared its aspirations to the reach of Facebook (O:FB) and YouTube. ""We believe the universality of music gives us the opportunity to reach many of the over 3.6 billion internet users globally,"" it said.
With 71 million premium subscribers globally, Spotify has about twice as many paying customers as music streaming runner up Apple, with 36 million. Including those who listen to advertising-supported streams, Spotify has about 159 million monthly average users. 
Amazon Music Unlimited has 16 million paying subscribers, and  Pandora Media  Inc (N:P) has 5.48 million total subscribers.
Google has not said how many subscribers it has to Google Play, its music streaming service.
Spotify's premium subscription costs $9.99 a month, but it said it saw great potential in its ad-supported service, which Apple does not offer.
""With our ad-supported service, we believe there is a large opportunity to grow users and gain market share from traditional terrestrial radio,"" Spotify said.
The net proportion of subscribers who left Spotify's paid-for service, or churn, fell to 5.1 percent of paying customers at the end of 2017, from 6.9 percent at the start of 2016, the company said.
""This has been a question we've been wondering for a long time: how sustainable is Spotify's model? This is the very first time we're seeing public disclosure about churn, and the news there is really good,"" said Larry Miller, head of the music business program at New York University's Steinhardt School.
Spotify calculated that customers brought in 3.6 times more revenue over their life as a user than the company spent on marketing to attract them, as of the end of 2017, helping boost free cash flow to 109 million euros by the end of last year.
Still, in going head to head against Apple, Amazon and others, Spotify is ""competing against companies that never need to make a dime on music as a standalone business and that in fact use it to drive other aspects of their business,"" Miller said. 
Apple and Alphabet also control the two main operating systems used by smartphones, iOS and Android. They and Amazon are all developing computer assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri, that could give the bigger companies advantages.
""Many of our competitors enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, legacy operating histories, and larger marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical, human, and other resources,"" Spotify said in its filing.
Apple has launched massive marketing campaigns around its service and added subscribers rapidly in the last three years. ""I don't think there's any doubt that the pace of competition this year has quickened,"" Miller said.
Spotify has a powerful ally, in the music arm of China's Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700). The companies in December said they would buy minority stakes in each other, helping increase exposure to each other's core markets.
STOCK COULD BE VOLATILE
A direct listing does not dilute ownership, as would happen with a conventional initial public offering, and saves hundreds of millions of dollars in underwriting fees. But it also frees existing owners from any lockup period restricting them from selling their shares following the listing. 
Underwriters that provide price stability for new listings are not used in a direct listing, which could mean a volatile start for Spotify shares in public.
Shares trade privately in a wide band. Spotify is valued between $16.8 billion and $22.6 billion, based on recent ordinary share prices between $95 and $127.50 in the private markets in February and 177 million shares estimated outstanding by the end of February, according to its filing.
Synovus Trust portfolio manager Dan Morgan described Spotify as ""interesting,"" but questioned how quickly it might become profitable.
""How can Spotify monetize its user base beyond a $5-$15 monthly subscription fee?,"" Morgan asked.

778,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 07:46PM ET</span>","Amid NAFTA talks, Mexico airs concerns over U.S. steel tariffs","By Dave Graham and Lesley Wroughton
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's economy minister met with top U.S. trade officials on Wednesday midway through the latest push to renegotiate the NAFTA trade deal, as concerns about steel added to trade tensions between the two countries.
Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo met U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer during a hastily arranged visit to Washington as U.S., Mexican and Canadian officials held a seventh round of negotiations to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement.
In a statement, Mexico's economy ministry said Guajardo had discussed possible U.S. steel import tariffs with Ross, as well as bilateral agreements over tomatoes and sugar, which have been renegotiated periodically.
Guajardo also met with Lighthizer to discuss the agenda of the ministerial meeting on March 5 at the conclusion of the latest NAFTA talks in Mexico City, his ministry said.
U.S. President Donald Trump is considering imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on imports from China and elsewhere following a probe looking at whether imports of the metals threatened U.S. national security.
Among the options before Trump is a tariff of at least 24 percent on steel products from all countries. However, Trump could decide to exempt some countries from any measures, including its NAFTA trading partners and has indicated he might exempt Canada. 
A Mexican official said the Ross meeting would address Mexican concerns over trade in steel and tomatoes, noting that Mexico would retaliate against steel tariffs.
Ross has said he would not be surprised to see countries challenge any steel tariffs at the World Trade Organization.
There are concerns that stiff U.S. tariffs could raise global steel prices, which would impact Mexico. While Mexico is a large steel importer, it also exported approximately 4.5 million tonnes in 2016.
'HARD TO ACHIEVE'
Meanwhile in Mexico City, negotiators discussed the broad outlines of so-called rules of origin, which would have a big impact on the automotive industry.
Talks were hampered by the absence of the chief U.S. negotiator, Jason Bernstein, who was unexpectedly called to Washington on Tuesday for consultations and is unlikely to return to Mexico.
The possible delay in tackling the matter underlines the slow progress of the talks, which are supposed to wrap up by early April, but look set to drag on for longer.
The current round of talks will also focus on closing chapters related to digital trade, telecommunications, technical barriers to trade, good regulatory practices, and sanitary and phytosanitary measures, according to an official with knowledge of the talks.
Steve Verheul, Canada's chief negotiator in the NAFTA talks, reported some advances in Mexico City.
""We're making reasonably good progress so far,"" he told journalists without elaborating.
NAFTA talks have crawled along for the past six months, and Trump has threatened to walk away from the $1.2 trillion treaty unless major changes are made to benefit American interests.

Low banking penetration and income levels, as well as economies that are largely cash-based and viewed as a high credit risk, have long been considered major obstacles to the development of the continent's banking sector.
But the McKinsey report released on Wednesday -- drawing on performance data from 35 of Africa's leading banks and surveys of banking executives and customers -- said the number of banked Africans grew from 170 million in 2012 to nearly 300 million last year.
That figure is expected to rise to 450 million in the next five years, with banking revenue rising to $129 billion from about $86 billion now. 
""Globally, the banking industry is facing disappointing returns and sluggish growth,"" the report said. ""Africa's banking sector provides a refreshing contrast. Its markets are fast-growing and nearly twice as profitable as the global average.""
However, that growth is by no means evenly spread, either geographically or among income groups.
Only five countries -- South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt, Angola and Morocco -- currently account for 68 percent of Africa's total banking revenue. 
And about 60 percent of the total retail revenue growth of nearly $18 billion expected over the next five years will be concentrated in South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco and Ghana. 
""Where you are in Africa matters - in a big way,"" the report said. ""About 65 percent of African banks' profitability and 94 percent of their revenue growth are attributable to their geographical footprint."" 
And though only 15 percent of Africans had annual income above $5,000 last year, McKinsey's research indicated that nearly 70 percent of retail banking revenue growth through 2025 will come from customers earning between $6,000 and $36,000.
Meanwhile, heavy staff costs and labor-intensive, paper-dominated processes hold back productivity, the report said.
Credit risk also remains a concern, with non-performing loans accounting for more than 5 percent of African banks' portfolios.

LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc (N:YUM) said on Wednesday it is offering limited menus at its reopened UK KFC restaurants after a chicken supply snafu with a new delivery firm, but now there is a gravy shortage. 
The crisis in the UK market that accounted for roughly 3 percent of Yum's global system sales in 2017 comes as a business turnaround at the fried chicken chain was taking hold.
KFC, which has 900 restaurants in the UK and Ireland, switched its delivery contract from Bidvest Logistics to DHL on Feb. 14. Shortly after, the chain closed hundreds of restaurants in the region due to ""teething"" problems at DHL. 
A Yum spokesman said on Wednesday that 97 percent of the region's KFC restaurants are open, but are now experiencing gravy supply disruptions. The spokesman did not immediately comment on the financial impact of the closures.
""Due to the ongoing distribution challenges DHL is experiencing, some restaurants are continuing to serve a reduced menu,"" a spokesman said. ""We're working as hard as we can to get this sorted out. We know that our gravy is a big favorite!""
The chain has apologized to customers, running a newspaper ad showing a photo of a chicken bucket with the KFC logo letters rearranged to read ""FCK."" The accompanying text read: ""WE'RE SORRY. A chicken restaurant without any chicken. It's not ideal ... Thank you for bearing with us.""
It has invited Twitter users in the UK and Ireland to click on #WheresMyChicken to find their nearest open KFC.
A Twitter post for the police in Whitefield, Manchester, read: ""For those who contacted the Police about KFC being out of chicken ... please STOP. Their website says the Prestwich store is now open if you want to follow the four police cars through the drive thru.""
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm whether customers were indeed contacting local police.
Elsewhere, one Twitter user posted a video of two men in full KFC uniforms buying chicken at an Asda [WMTAS.UL] supermarket. In the video, when a man off-camera questions the workers about the purchases, one responded: ""Chicken is chicken, you know ... You're still getting KFC chicken at the end of the day.""

Shares in Yum, whose brands are know for creatively engaging social media-savvy customers, were up 2.7 percent at $82.32 in midday trading.

807,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",Inflation Hawks May Be Right If Taipei Toilet Rolls Are a Guide,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan’s shoppers -- like global financial markets -- are getting skittish on inflation.
A reported spike in prices by toilet paper makers spurred a run on supplies in Taipei over the past week. The island’s premier even had to step in to urge the public not to hoard this most staple of consumer staples.
Click here to read about Taiwan’s Toilet Paper ‘Crisis’
While the run on rolls may prove fleeting, the episode is a reminder of just how quickly inflation expectations can turn. For years, low wages, aging demographics and tepid growth have kept a firm lid on Taiwan’s prices -- just as they have in many parts of the world. Now, higher upstream prices and a pick up in economic activity is spurring movement.
""We are starting to hear stories like this, that there is more upward pressure on prices than downward,"" said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong. ""We are witnessing a move to more significant rates of inflation in Asia as well as globally.""
Volatility returned to global markets in February as fears of inflation’s return sent stocks and bonds slumping amid worries that central banks would need to tighten monetary policy faster than expected. Jerome Powell this week added to market angst by opening the door to the Federal Reserve raising U.S. interest rates four times this year.
Read more: Powell’s rosy outlook is fueling interest-rate hike bets
The International Monetary Fund predicts a global economic expansion of 3.9 percent this year and next, which would be the fastest since 2011. At the same time, labor markets continue to tighten and corporate executives are signaling firmer investment intentions.
That’s spurring some big name investors to forecast higher prices. Hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones said inflation is about to appear “with a vengeance” and may force the new Fed chair to accelerate interest-rate hikes.
Iris Pang, an economist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV in Hong Kong, said the surge in prices for toilet rolls stems from China’s efforts to clean up its environment, which is pushing up the cost of recycled paper and pulp prices too. It’s another reminder of how China’s swing from producer price deflation to inflation is changing the global price outlook.
To be sure, it would be a stretch to view Taiwan’s toiler paper spike as a signal of things to come.
""Whether garlic in India, pepper in Indonesia, or eggs in China, there is always one item or the other to get the inflation watcher excited,"" said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics research at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) in Hong Kong. ""In reality, however, these barely signal broader price pressure and are more reflective of temporary supply disruption of certain goods."""

Ackman said he thought  United Tech  was a great company, CNBC reported. (http://cnb.cx/2HUollQ)
The company's shares rose as much as 3.4 percent to $138.49.
United Tech's Chief Executive Greg Hayes said last week the company was exploring a breakup of its business portfolio, including jet engines, elevators and air conditioners.
Both United Technologies and Pershing Square declined to comment.
Earlier in the day, Herbalife said it planned to change its corporate name, refinance debt and effect a 2-for-1 stock split to boost shareholder returns, sending its shares up 7 percent to an all-time high.
Ackman's Herbalife move comes after a years-long bitter public spat with the company's management and investor Carl Icahn.
Ever since Ackman took a $1 billion short position against Herbalife in 2012, he has criticized the company as a pyramid scheme, saying its operating model benefits distributors more than the actual users of products.

He expected the company's shares to fall to zero. Instead Herbalife's shares have risen since Ackman made the short bet, forcing him to close that position last year and limit his losses by taking a position in options to sell shares.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Finland's investment arm to take more active board role,"By Jussi Rosendahl
HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's investment arm Solidium is stepping into the boardrooms of the companies it owns stakes in, to promote the interests of the firms themselves rather than the country, its managing director Antti Makinen said.
Solidium manages minority holdings in 12 major listed Finnish companies, which are collectively worth about 8.1 billion euros ($10 billion) and originate from an era of state-led industrialization.
""It is natural for us as a large owner to have a member in the boards ... This is more of a rule for large owners, we have been an exception,"" Makinen told Reuters in his office.
Solidium holds stakes of 5 to 25 percent and Makinen, who took the job last year after working at Nordea Bank (ST:NDA), has been proposed as a board member of holding company Sampo (HE:SAMPO), pulp and packaging group  Stora Enso  (HE:STERV) and engineering firm  Metso  (HE:METSO).
Over time, Solidium plans to have board members in each of its companies, including telecoms carrier Elisa (HE:ELISA), chemicals business Kemira (HE:KEMIRA) and steel companies Outokumpu (HE:OUT1V) and SSAB (ST:SSABa).
""It makes communication easier with the companies. We don't like to be informed by newspapers on, for example, that the CEO of our company is leaving,"" Makinen said, referring to an announcement by Metso last year that its CEO was going after less than a year in the job.
Solidium was founded a decade ago as a bid to distance politicians from the state's holdings.
But the structure proved unclear, with some politicians complaining over being kept in the dark and some investors wondering whether the state was using its influence.
State-ownership is a sensitive subject in Finland where many think the government should do more to protect Finnish jobs.
Disagreements over how Solidium should be run led to dismissal of its former chairman, and prompted a strategic reform, including the boardroom drive.
SOME INFLUENCE
Asked if one of Solidium's aims is to protect Finnish jobs, Makinen said:
""Our priority is that the companies succeed ... There might be discussions concerning what is good for the company and what would be good for a larger interest, but the company's interest must always come first.""
He referred to a 2014 Finnish-Swedish merger of Rautaruukki and SSAB, which was approved by Solidium and where Helsinki lost a headquarters.
""That proves that we are a rational owner.""
Solidium's mandate is to own significant Finnish companies with an idea to keep them ""more or less Finnish"", he said.
""We like to have some influence, but we don't want to be autocrats. We can well be the second biggest owner and support the main owner.""
Makinen thinks that a state-owner is still needed in the country.
""Finland does not have very much private capital that could largely own large companies... To be a good anchor investor, one must have the financial muscle to support a company.""
However, not all investors support Solidium's move.
""The state has adopted a wrong role in the financial market. It is not wise to have the taxpayers taking so much business risk,"" Jukka Oksaharju, Equity Strategist at Nordnet bank, said.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 12:03PM ET</span>","Putin to pledge higher health, education spending in Thursday speech: sources","By Darya Korsunskaya and Polina Nikolskaya
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to promise higher welfare and infrastructure spending when he addresses parliament on Thursday, but to be unspecific about how the increase should be financed, four sources familiar with his proposals said. 
Polls show Putin, who has dominated Russian politics as president or prime minister for the last 18 years, is on track to be comfortably re-elected on March 18. 
On Thursday, Putin will deliver his annual address to parliament and other members of the Russian political elite, delayed since late last year.
Sources familiar with his proposals told Reuters that the speech had been reworked many times because there was no agreement between different parts of the government about measures to spur economic development and how to finance them.
However, the sources said that officials had managed to agree on an increase on health, education and infrastructure spending in principle, but that there was still a lot of work to do when it came to drafting specific changes. 
""It seems like there is a kind of political agreement that the president cannot mention the sources (of financing for the spending increase),"" one senior government official said. 
""He will speak of the (policy) direction and the government should then propose how it should all work."" 
A debate among Russian officials about higher welfare and infrastructure spending -- something the World Bank believes would help Moscow spur growth -- has intensified in recent months among government officials. 
There is a consensus among Russia's ruling elite that the pension age will need to be increased and other socially-sensitive steps taken, but Putin is not expected to mention those in his speech, the sources said. 
The main decisions on how to finance higher social and infrastructure spending are expected only to be firmed up after Putin formally begins what would be his fourth presidential term in May, according to the sources. 

The Kremlin did not reply to a Reuters request for comment.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's use of credit ratings to determine which banks may be trusted to hold state funds should help ensure the health of the banking sector following a clean up by the central bank, the head of Russian rating agency ACRA said.
Ekaterina Trofimova also told Reuters last year's rescue of three of the country's biggest private banks -- Otkritie, B&N and Promsvyazbank (PSB) -- showed that deposits and accounts could be at risk even if a lender is relatively large. 
""After last year's events in the banking sector ... it became clear ... that the size of a bank is not the factor which would fully protect the funds,"" Trofimova said in a written reply to questions.
She said qualitative criteria such as ratings should also be used to determine what state resources a bank can access. 
ACRA was established after the top three rating agencies downgraded Russia following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and has been promoted by the Russian government and central bank. 
Prior to the takeover of Otkritie, then Russia's biggest private bank, B&N and PSB in 2017, Russia's central bank had shut dozens of smaller lenders as part of a wider clean-up of a banking sector hit hard by plunging oil prices and sanctions.
Central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina introduced new rules last year that mean state entities will only be able to invest funds in banks with strong ratings from the two Russian ratings agencies -- ACRA and Expert RA. 
To access the widest range of state funds and instruments, the banks will also need to meet certain criteria on the capital size and some other requirements. 
Eligibility to hold funds of state entities effectively gives a bank access to cheaper cash. 
Otkritie, which was taken over at the end of August, had seen a large outflow in client funds after it was assigned a low rating by ACRA. 
The central bank has said it expects to spend around a trillion rubles bailing out Otkritie, B&N and PSB. 
Nabiullina has said Otkritie and B&N will eventually be floated on the stock exchange as the state seeks to reduce its role in the sector, of which it now controls about 66 percent.
There are still over 500 banks in Russia, led by state-owned Sberbank and VTB. 
Trofimova said the switch to using ratings would benefit mid-sized private and 'financially stable' banks, improving the sector's health in general. She said a probation period would be needed for the changes but did not indicate a timeframe.
RATIONALE
The Russian state and state-owned companies had about 5.9 trillion rubles ($105 billion) in Russian bank accounts at the start of this year, more than one-fifth of the total funds by the legal entities which the banks hold, Nabiullina has said. 
""It is obvious that the state should minimize the risk of losing its funds,"" Nabiullina said this week. ""Measuring by the size of the capital and by the state's stake gives advantages to the large banks ... and does not always give a full protection."" 
In a written reply to Reuters questions, Trofimova said that given the variety of the state tools, the access to them secured by a bank's ratings could differ depending on the conditions. 
Alexei Moiseev, a deputy finance minister, said this week that the government has proposed a minimum A- rating for banks to access the full range of state funds. 
It is not yet clear if ratings from the both agencies -- ACRA and Expert RA -- would be needed to access all or some of the state funds.

825,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 11:20AM ET</span>",Comcast informally tells Brussels of intention to bid for Sky,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast (O:CMCSA) has informally notified the European Commission of its intention to bid for Britain's pay-TV group Sky (L:SKYB), triggering the regulatory process for the $31 billion deal.
The world's biggest entertainment company shocked the market on Tuesday when it said it had approached Sky about a deal, challenging Rupert Murdoch's Twenty First Century Fox (O:FOXA) and Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) which had already hatched a complex plan to take control of the pay-TV group.
The Commission website shows no formal request has been made yet but a spokesman for Comcast said it had made an informal notification to get the ball rolling.
Comcast, the owner of NBC, CNBC and MSNBC, said it went public with its approach because it wanted to start the regulatory review. It believes it only has a narrow window to get the deal done before Fox nears completion of its own takeover of the 61 percent of Sky it does not already own. 
Comcast's action complicates a separate move by Disney to buy a range of Fox assets for $52 billion, including Sky, which was based on the assumption that Fox would complete its purchase.
Disney's Bob Iger was in Paris when the news broke. He was quoted in Le Figaro newspaper as saying he had not yet studied Comcast's provisional offer in detail.
""It does not compromise our agreement with Fox,"" he said in the newspaper report. ""In this agreement, Fox would bring over the 39 percent of the capital of Sky that it already holds, and would, furthermore, make an offer for the rest of Sky's capital.""
Fox has said it remains committed to its cash offer announced in December 2016.
But investors are now hoping that Fox will make a higher offer or question whether Disney could make its own direct bid for Sky. Shares in Sky were trading at 13.40 pounds on Wednesday, above the 12.50 pounds offered by Comcast. 
Fox agreed its deal to buy Sky in December 2016 but it has been forced to go through a comprehensive regulatory review after politicians raised concerns that Murdoch held too much influence in Britain. It agreed to buy Sky at 10.75 pounds per share.

852,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 07:09PM ET</span>",Exclusive: LJM Partners shutting its doors after 'vol-mageddon' losses in U.S. stocks,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - A Chicago-based fund manager that took risky bets on stock-market swings is shutting its doors after the strategy failed during the slump in U.S. equity markets in early February, according to a letter sent to investors on Wednesday.
LJM Partners Ltd, run by Anthony Caine, will be the first investment manager to close after complex trades failed spectacularly in the Feb. 5 reversal of fortune in U.S. stocks that some investors called ""vol-mageddon."" LJM Partners and an affiliate saw losses of 80 percent or more.
The company, known in industry jargon as a ""commodity trading adviser"" or CTA, managed a series of strategies that attempted to effectively make money from the difference between how much the market moves and how much investors are willing to pay to insure against those price swings.
In normal markets, investors are willing to pay a premium for protection.
On Feb. 5, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility of the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock index (SPX), logged its largest single-day jump ever.
An affiliate of LJM Partners ran LJM Preservation and Growth Fund (O:LJMAX), a mutual fund aimed at a retail audience which lost half its value on Feb. 5. The fund then lost much of its remaining value the day after as it unwound holdings at unfavorable prices to raise cash at the insistence of its broker, the company told investors in an earlier letter. 
On Feb. 7, the affiliate closed the fund to new investment after losses totaling 80 percent. The fund will close altogether by March 29, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this week.
The affiliate-managed mutual fund held assets worth $812 million at the beginning of the month but that has shriveled to $14 million.
LJM Partners, which reported managing $547 million as of January, decided ""to not resume trading and liquidate all remaining investor capital,"" the company said in the letter on Wednesday. ""We are deeply saddened by this decision and are thankful for the many years that we had the opportunity to manage the LJM strategies.""
LJM had been one of a handful of fund companies that found success selling relatively complex and high-fee funds to investors hoping to cut risk and boost returns.
Demand for such products has persisted even as the investment management industry's profits are being hollowed out by a move to use lower-cost funds, some which simply track an index.
The LJM mutual fund took in $393 million in new cash from investors in 2017, its best sales since launching in 2013, according to the Lipper unit of Thomson Reuters, despite fees as high as 3.34 percent a year.
In letters to clients this month, Caine, a veteran of the 1990s technology boom who later went into finance, said he had planned to resume investing despite the losses. The Preservation and Growth Fund was also run by Anish Parvataneni, a former trader for the well known fund investor Ken Griffin of Citadel.
""Volatility and options markets experienced an extreme outlier event,"" Caine said in one of the letters. ""Monday's losses were so severe because as volatility spiked exponentially in the afternoon, the illiquidity in the markets severely limited LJM's ability to reduce risk.""
Phone calls to LJM have not been returned. A Reuters reporter who visited their headquarters recently was escorted out by LJM's chief compliance officer, Katy McBride, who declined to answer questions.
Caine's next challenge may be in court. 
Investors are suing him and Parvataneni over what they said were inadequate disclosures. The fund touted its ability ""to deliver solid returns while maintaining risk parameters"" in its most recent annual report to shareholders.

Listen to Goldman Sachs, of course.
The firm has developed an index of stocks called the High Growth Investment Ratio Basket, which is designed to include companies whose share price is most likely to get a boost from the new tax law, given their past use of excess capital.
Goldman's basket includes not just the companies that have most heavily reinvested money into capital expenditures and research and development, but also those set to generate the highest return on it.
For context, the median stock in the index has reinvested 81% of its trailing three years of cash flow from operations, compared with just 13% for the average S&P 500 company, according to Goldman. The firm also forecasts that basket members will offer 18% cash return on capital invested, compared with just 12% for the broader benchmark.
Without further ado, here are the 16 stocks that best fit the bill, arranged in increasing order of three-year growth investment ratio:
Ticker: WYNN
Industry: Consumer discretionary
Year-to-date return: -2%
Three-year growth investment ratio: 101%
Ticker: CF
Industry: Materials

All three major indexes fell more than 1% after the markets closed on Tuesday amid hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed chair said he thought the economy had strengthened, leaving investors worried that the central bank may hike up interest rates four times instead of three.

The nutritional supplement maker also said it intends to launch a ""modified Dutch auction"" tender offer, seeking to repurchase between $450 million and up to $650 million of its outstanding common stock.
The moves come a few months after activist investor Bill Ackman bought options to sell shares as a new way to bet against the company, after closing a $1 billion short position he took in 2012.
For years, Ackman has labeled the company a pyramid scheme and said it will eventually crumble under regulatory scrutiny over its operating model, which he alleges benefits distributors more than the actual users of products.
Herbalife's shares have instead risen since Ackman made the $1 billion bet, forcing him to close that position and limit his losses through options to sell shares.
Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management was not immediately available to comment.
Herbalife said on Wednesday it intends to change its name to Herbalife Nutrition Ltd and would also refinance a portion of its $1.15 billion outstanding convertible notes due Aug. 15, 2019.
The forward stock split will be Herbalife's first in seven years and will double the number of outstanding shares, boosting liquidity.

The proposals to split its stock and change its name will be put to a vote at the company's Annual General Meeting on April 24.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 01:09PM ET</span>","'Pharma bro' Shkreli seeks 12 to 18 month sentence, below guidelines","By Brendan Pierson
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Martin Shkreli, the former drug company executive convicted of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he ran, has asked a federal judge to sentence him to 12 months to 18 months in prison, much less than suggested federal guidelines.
Shkreli, 34, has been in jail since September, when U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered a $5,000 bounty for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. Matsumoto is scheduled to sentence him on March 9.
Shkreli's lawyers said in a court filing on Tuesday that a sentence of 27 years or more calculated using federal guidelines would be ""draconian and offensive.""
The filing included a letter from Shkreli, asking the judge for leniency. ""I accept the fact that I made serious mistakes, but I still believe that I am a good person with much potential,"" he said.
In addition to the prison sentence, they proposed Shkreli complete 2,000 hours of community service and undergo court-mandated therapy.
Prosecutors are expected to submit their own proposed sentence next week.
Shkreli, nicknamed ""Pharma Bro,"" raised the price of anti-infection drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015 while he was chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals.
A jury found him guilty last August of unrelated securities fraud charges. They determined that he lied to investors about the performance of his hedge funds, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He also was found guilty of conspiring to manipulate the stock price of a drug company he founded, Retrophin Inc.
Shkreli's investors eventually came out ahead after he paid them in shares of Retrophin, and in some cases through settlement agreements and consulting contracts with the company, according to testimony at trial.
However, Matsumoto ruled Monday that he would still be held responsible for defrauding investors out of millions of dollars, because he secured their investments through fraud.
Shkreli's lawyers said in the filing that he made mistakes when communicating with his investors not because he wanted to steal from them, but because he ""could not bring himself to admit failure.""
They also tried to counter the view that Shkreli was the ""greedy Pharma Bro."" They pointed to his work at Retrophin to develop a drug for a rare childhood degenerative disease called PKAN that was used to treat some patients in Cyprus, as well as online relationships he has maintained with patients.
Even the controversial Daraprim price hike was meant to fund research into rare diseases, they said.

The filing included dozens of letters supporting Shkreli, including from family members and a former Turing employee who praised his ""altruistic passion.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are considering changes to the ""Volcker rule"" Wall Street has sought for years that would make it easier and cheaper for banks to comply and allow them more leeway in trading and investing, according to several regulatory and industry sources.
Part of the Dodd-Frank reform law passed after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, the Volcker rule aimed to prevent banks, such as Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM), from making risky market bets while accepting taxpayer-insured deposits.
The rule forced many Wall Street banks, which before the crisis could gamble on their own account across various assets, to restructure their businesses, including overhauling their trading operations and hiving off billions of dollars' worth of investment vehicles.
Yet banks and some of their customers say the rule, which runs at more than 1,000 pages, is too much of a burden for the financial industry by limiting banks' ability to facilitate investments and hedges for investors and depressing trading volumes in some assets. 
They also say the rule's complexity and opacity makes it so difficult to satisfy that  JP Morgan Chase  chief executive Jamie Dimon was once quoted as saying traders would need a lawyer and a psychiatrist by their side to ensure they complied. 
While the changes being considered by regulators would not bring back the heady pre-crisis trading activity, they would help address some of these problems, people familiar with the discussions said. 
Modifications being considered include: scrapping the presumption that short-term trades are proprietary unless banks prove otherwise, making it clearer which types of funds banks are banned from investing in, permanently exempting some foreign funds from the ban, and anointing a lead regulator to oversee the rule's enforcement.
Congress is now considering a bill that would exempt lenders with under $10 billion in assets from the rule, but larger banks are lobbying for changes in how the rule is interpreted and applied to them. While financial regulators have said they agree on the need to revise the Volcker rule, some specific changes they are considering have not yet been reported.
Regulators are likely to release their proposals in coming months, in what is expected to be a milestone in President Donald Trump's promised push for less regulation that could save Wall Street billions of dollars.
""We're taking a fresh look at the Volcker rule,"" said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell before Congress on Tuesday.
The Fed, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have joint responsibility for enforcing the rule and broadly agree it could be simplified. 
""There's unanimity on a need to act,"" said one banker briefed on the matter.
Congress wrote the Volcker rule into law but regulators have broad discretion to determine how to make that a reality through writing and enforcing the regulations.
Staff at the agencies have begun gathering data and have identified potential changes, according to several people familiar with the effort. Work will accelerate once Jelena McWilliams becomes FDIC chair, among the last of Trump's top financial nominees who should be confirmed by the Senate in the coming months.
""You’re going to see momentum start building and start building quickly,"" said Tom Quaadman, executive vice president with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
Spokesmen for the Fed, FDIC, OCC and CFTC declined to comment. The SEC did not respond to a request for comment.
PRESUMPTION, DEFINITIONS
One major change being discussed would see the reversal of the ""rebuttable presumption"" which puts the onus on banks to prove their compliance with the Volcker rule. Now, all positions held for fewer than 60 days are considered banned proprietary trading unless banks convince regulators they serve a permitted purpose such as a client trade.
Banks want the burden of proof to shift to regulators, so that all trades will be allowed unless regulators identify an issue while supervising the banks, five people familiar with the discussions said.
Regulators are also considering narrowing the definitions of such terms as ""proprietary trading"" and ""covered funds"", they said. The latter prohibits investments in risky vehicles, such as hedge funds, but it also prevents banks from doing less risky business such as some forms of wealth management.
More clarity about what is allowed and what is not would give banks more flexibility in trading and investment, those people said.
Regulators are also considering further steps to exempt certain overseas funds affected by the rule because of links to banks with U.S. operations. Last July, regulators exempted such foreign funds for a year and are now considering a one year extension or possibly making the exemption permanent, two people briefed on the matter said.
There is general agreement on refining Volcker across the political spectrum, but Democrats - some of whom say the rule does not go far enough - are wary of handing too much discretion to banks when it comes to trading. 
So far, banks have lobbied unsuccessfully for Congress to appoint a lead Volcker regulator, ideally the Fed, as part of a reform bill pending in the Senate, according to three sources. 
Now, they are now pushing regulators to settle on a lead authority among themselves, or at least agree on a consistent standard for supervising and enforcing the rule.
Bankers and regulators acknowledge that getting all five watchdogs to march in lockstep will be tough and asking some of them to cede their authority will be even tougher. 
The OCC initially seized the initiative issuing a public consultation on Volcker in August, but since then the Fed has taken the lead, banking sources said. Powell said on Tuesday the Fed was the ""natural"" lead for the rewriting effort.

""It's like turning an aircraft carrier,"" said Quaadman. ""But now you're seeing they're beginning.""

880,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 10:19AM ET</span>","TJX quarterly same-store sales beat, shares hit record high","(Reuters) - Off-price apparel retailer TJX Cos Inc (N:TJX) on Wednesday beat analysts' estimates for holiday-quarter same-store sales as discounts drew more shoppers to its Marmaxx and TJX Canada stores, sending its shares to a record high.
The company's shares rose as much as 8.6 percent to $83.95 in early trading.
TJX, which has succeeded in bucking the larger slowdown in apparel sales due to its treasure-hunt type bargain deals, had said it had started the holiday quarter by shipping more cold-weather apparel and had been ""in a terrific inventory position"".
The retail climate during the holiday season improved for the first time in years, as a robust economy encouraged shoppers to spend more on clothing and accessories.
""We see abundant opportunities in the marketplace for major brands and high-quality merchandise and are pursuing numerous initiatives to keep driving sales and customer traffic"", Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said.
TJX also raised its quarterly dividend by 25 percent to 39 cents per share and said it would repurchase about $2.5 billion to $3 billion worth of shares this fiscal year.
Same-store sales rose 4 percent in the reported quarter, beating estimates of 2.1 percent.
Marmaxx, the company's biggest and most profitable unit which includes T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, recorded comparable-store sales that rose 3 percent, beating estimates of 1.5 percent.
For the first quarter, TJX also forecast adjusted earnings of 85 cents to 87 cents per share, below average analysts' estimate of 99 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Excluding items, the company earned $1.19 per share. Net sales rose 15.8 percent to $10.96 billion.

Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $1.28 per share on revenue of $10.76 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged lower on Wednesday with a drop in energy shares, and the S&P 500 was on track for its biggest monthly fall since January 2016.
The S&P energy index (SPNY) fell 1.3 percent following sharply lower oil prices.
Retailer shares gained, however, following upbeat results.
Booking Holdings (O:BKNG), formerly known as Priceline, rose 7.7 percent after reporting upbeat quarterly profit, helped by higher hotel bookings, while off-price apparel seller TJX (N:TJX) jumped about 10 percent after posting upbeat same-store sales.
The S&P 500 and the Dow also were set to break a 10-month winning streak after a steep early-month selloff sparked by fears that higher inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates more than investors are expecting.
Stocks have recovered some since then, but the trading has remained volatile. 
""We're seeing a little bit of reversal from some of the gains we saw last week. So we're kind of bouncing around the 2,750 area,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 177.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 25,232.42, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 9.95 points, or 0.36 percent, to 2,734.33 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 7.84 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,322.51.
About 76 percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That is above the average 72 percent recorded in the past four quarters.
Celgene's 8.1 percent drop (O:CELG) was a drag on the healthcare sector after U.S. health regulators rejected the company's application seeking approval of a multiple sclerosis drug.
Wall Street opened higher after the government revised lower its reading on economic activity in the fourth quarter to 2.5 percent. A regional gauge on U.S. Midwest factory activity fell more than forecast in February, while pending home sales unexpectedly declined in January.
The CBOE Volatility index (VIX), a measure of short-term stock market volatility, rose to 19.63.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.87-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 10 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 55 new highs and 62 new lows.

The factory being closed down is located at Joue-les-Tours, a town toward the west of France, south of Paris.
Boosted by low interest rates, a global economic rebound and high business confidence, France has only in the last year managed to emerge from a decade of low growth and weak job creation that has left nearly 3.5 million people out of work.
Last month, Tupperware took a big charge in its fourth quarter that wiped out profits and forecast weak demand in the current quarter, causing its shares to slump.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>","U.S. stocks to keep recovering, set to climb 8 percent this year: Reuters poll","By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks will build on the recent recovery from a selloff earlier this month to rack up an over-8-percent gain for the year, according to a Reuters poll of Wall Street market strategists, extending a bull run that began in 2009.
For now, strong corporate profit growth and a robust economic expansion that is being given additional fiscal stimulus will support further gains in stocks.
But fears of inflation rising sharply enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to speed up interest rate hikes -- which in part sparked the more than 10 percent recent drop from the benchmark S&P 500 stock index's (SPX) Jan. 26 record high -- will still plague the market, along with increased volatility.
The S&P 500 is likely to end this year at 2,900, about 8.5 percent above 2017's finish and 4.3 percent up from Monday's close of 2779.6, based on the median forecast of more than 50 strategists polled by Reuters in the last two weeks.
The median forecast in the poll for end-2019 was 3,000.
Forecasts for U.S. earnings this year have jumped since December, when U.S. lawmakers approved sweeping changes to the tax law, including slashing the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Improving economic growth both here and abroad has also lifted profit expectations.
""We're in an equity-friendly economic backdrop. We have a growing economy, growing corporate earnings. The only reason we're not more optimistic on our target is because of rising interest rates,"" said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon Wealth Management, which has a year-end target of 2,850 on the S&P 500. 
BETTER VALUATIONS
The recent deep market losses and optimism about earnings have in turn helped to drive down the benchmark index's price-to-earnings multiple, easing worries about lofty valuations. 
The index at one point this month was trading at its lowest PE ratio in more than a year, according to Thomson Reuters data.
""Things are actually less expensive because of the powerful earnings (growth) and to a certain extent the market pulling back,"" said Jonathan Golub, Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist, who forecasts the S&P 500 will end the year at 3,000.
""We're in this nice place where things are moving forward.""
Stocks already have recovered much of the losses of the recent selloff, with the S&P 500 now roughly 4 percent from its peak. 
Analysts estimate 2018 earnings growth for S&P 500 companies of 19.2 percent, up from a late December forecast of 11.5 percent.
President Donald Trump's goal is for U.S. economic growth of 3.0 percent annually. With the tax overhaul already approved, investors are optimistic legislation to boost infrastructure spending may be next. 
VOLATILITY
Many strategists left their 2018 forecasts unchanged from before this month's selloff, though some said they had already priced a pullback into their numbers.
Volatility spiked sharply during the market correction. Indeed, many strategists in the poll said the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), a key barometer of expected near-term volatility of the S&P 500 index, this year will stay well above its average of 11 over the past year, mostly likely in the range of 15 to 20. The index ended Monday at 15.80.
""Our market call would continue to be supported by growth but with the risk that we do see a more volatile year than we saw last year,"" said Jill Carey Hall, an equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) in New York. 
The Fed left interest rates unchanged in January, but said inflation would likely rise this year. The central bank raised rates three times last year and in December policymakers expected three more hikes for this year.
Among sectors that several strategists expect will do well this year are financials, which they say will benefit from higher interest rates, and technology, which led S&P 500 gains last year amid strong profit growth.
On the flip side, strategists see a less favorable year for utilities and other sectors that tend to underperform when rates are rising.
The poll also showed the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) ending 2018 at 27,200, 6 percent above Monday's close of 25,709.27. The index is forecast to end 2019 at 27,650.

In an interview with ABC News, Dick's CEO Ed Stack said the company would no longer sell assault-style firearms or high-capacity magazines, and would not sell any guns to those under age 21.
""We're taking these guns out of all of our stores permanently,"" Stack said, adding that he was prepared for any potential backlash toward the business. 
Pennsylvania-based Dick's sells weapons through its Dick's Sporting Goods and Field & Stream stores.
Stack said there were not enough systematic protections to prevent gun sales to people who are potential threats, and urged Congress to act comprehensively not only on background checks but also on mental health and other possible solutions.

""The systems that are in place across the board just aren't effective enough to keep us from selling someone a gun like that and so we've decided that we're not gong to sell the assault-type rifles anymore,"" Stack told ABC.

The Canada-based drugmaker's revenue will also be pressured as the company continues selling off businesses to free up cash and reduce its debt burden of some $25 billion.
Valeant has already divested its Dendreon cancer treatment unit as well as several skin care brands acquired during a debt-fueled deal-making binge under former CEO Mike  Pearson  (LON:PSON).
""Since the end of the first quarter of 2016, we've reduced our total debt by more than 20 percent, and we will continue to address our debt, as well as reduce expenses,"" said Valeant Chief Executive Officer Joseph Papa.
Valeant has also sharpened its focus on more profitable products including its Bausch and Lomb eye care line and treatments for Wilson's disease and gastrointestinal diseases.
The Wilson's disease treatment is expected to face competition from Teva Pharmaceuticals' (TA:TEVA) generic version launched earlier in February.
Other Valeant products including heart drug Nitropress, a top-selling product once criticized for its steep price, also face mounting competition from generics.
Valeant forecast 2018 revenue of $8.10 billion to $8.30 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $8.34 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The drugmaker's U.S.-listed shares fell 9 percent to $16.84 in premarket trading following the news.
The stock, which hit a peak of over $250 in 2015, has languished under $30 for much of the past two years amid intense scrutiny into the company's drug price hikes and its unorthodox use of a specialty pharmacy to boost sales.
On Wednesday, Valeant said it would pay $58 million to resolve a class action lawsuit by buyers of its acne medication Solodyn, who allege that a Valeant-owned company sought to delay the launch of cheaper, generic versions of Solodyn, in violation of antitrust laws.
Valeant reported a net income of $513 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared to a loss of $515 million a year earlier, helped by a one-time benefit of $1.32 billion from new U.S. tax laws.
Excluding one-time items, Valeant earned 98 cents per share, edging past analysts' estimates of 97 cents.

Revenue fell 10 percent to $2.16 billion, just shy of analysts' expectations of $2.17 billion.

Denso said the plant will have one new production line devoted to gasoline direct injectors and the other three for fuel pumps.

LONDON (Reuters) - Tough trading conditions sank two high-profile retailers on Wednesday, with the collapse of Toys R Us UK and electronics chain Maplin sending ripples across the sector.
The administration of the two retailers, a form of creditor protection, highlights the grim state of the UK high street, which has suffered from weak consumer sentiment, the growth of online sales and currency swings due to Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
The two collapses put over 5,000 jobs at risk, and Maplin blamed the adverse economic environment.
""The business has worked hard over recent months to mitigate a combination of impacts from sterling devaluation post Brexit, a weak consumer environment and the withdrawal of credit insurance,"" Maplin CEO Graham Harris said in a statement, adding new capital had been ""impossible to raise"" in such market conditions.
""These macro factors have been the principal challenge,"" he added.
The two administrations unnerved investors in the sector. Shares in Mothercare (L:MTC), which competes with Babies R Us, slumped around 9 percent to an all-time low.
Hedge funds are also betting against some retailers such as  Debenhams  (L:DEB) and Pets At Home (L:PETSP) as the sector struggles. 
Maplin and Toys R Us UK stores will stay open for now while administrators determine their future.
The toy retailer, which also operates as Babies R Us, has struggled in Britain in recent years as shoppers increasingly prefer to spend online rather than visit its large out-of-town stores. Toys R Us administrator Simon Thomas said newer, smaller shops had outperformed the older, warehouse-style stores.
Rebecca Long-Bailey, the opposition Labour party's business spokeswoman, said the government should ""urgently address problems across the retail sector.""
""It's devastating that over 5,500 High Street jobs risk being lost. This latest shock in the retail sector continues a worrying trend for our shopping streets and centers,"" she said.
A government spokesman said it was a ""worrying"" time for workers at the businesses.
Other brands are facing difficulties. Sky News reported that restaurant chain Prezzo plans to close up to a third of its 300 outlets, and that department store House of Fraser had asked landlords for rent reductions. 

Hamburger restaurant chain Byron said in January it had agreed to restructure through a company voluntary arrangement with creditors.

LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors cut their equity exposure to a three-month low in February after markets went into freefall early in the month and volatility spiked, though most still expect stocks to test new highs despite rising bond yields.
Reuters' monthly asset allocation poll of 51 wealth managers and chief investment officers in Europe, the United States, Britain and Japan was carried out between Feb. 12-26, after a savage sell-off that wiped trillions off share prices.
Poll participants cut their overall equity holdings by over 1 percentage point to 49 percent of their global balanced portfolios, the lowest since November, and raised cash to 4.9 percent, a five-month high. 
""The froth of the equity markets has blown off and a period of consolidation is now to be expected,"" said John Husselbee, head of multi-asset at Liontrust.
Mouhammed Choukeir, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros, added that while the synchronized upswing in the global economy looked set to continue in 2018, ""the easy part of the race is behind us"". 
Several managers stressed the importance of implementing effective hedging strategies to mitigate downside risk, whilst others highlighted the use of alternatives to provide uncorrelated returns. 
The poll showed allocation to alternatives -- a category that includes commodities and hedge funds -- rose to 7.7 percent, the highest since July 2016. 
Global equities (MIWO00000PUS) are on track to end February down 3.5 percent, their first monthly loss since October 2016. Yet around 86 percent of poll participants who answered a question on the equity bull market thought stocks could test new highs, surpassing the record peaks scaled in late January.
""With U.S. GDP seeing a further boost from spending and S&P 500 earnings expected to grow by around 16 percent over the next year, we think there is still scope for positive returns in the medium term,"" said Oliver Blackbourn, a multi-asset fund manager at Janus Henderson. 
But within equities, asset managers showed a preference for Europe, emerging markets and Japan over the United States, with some saying they had taken advantage of the global sell-off to buy at more attractive valuations. 
Euro zone stock holdings rose to 20.2 percent of global equity portfolios, the highest level since September, while Japan holdings jumped almost 2 percentage points to 18.6 percent. Emerging equities edged up to 14.1 percent from 13.7 percent in January. 
MSCI's benchmark emerging stocks index (MSCIEF) did not escape the global rout, however, and looks set to end the month down 4.4 percent, its first monthly loss since November 2016. 
INFLATION RISK
The broad-based equity correction was triggered when U.S. wage growth figures sparked fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve was behind the curve and would need to increase borrowing costs far more aggressively than previously expected. 
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) leapt to a four-year high of 2.94 percent in mid-February.
Although yields have retreated since, some 67 percent of poll participants who answered a question on this topic thought U.S. 10-year Treasury yields would end the year above 3 percent.
""Inflation risks are tilted to the upside,"" said Florian Spaete, senior equity strategist at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments, citing a tight labour market and rising wage growth.
U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that recent data had strengthened his confidence on inflation, prompting traders to raise bets that the Fed will squeeze in a fourth rate hike this year.
There was limited consensus among poll participants about the outlook for the VIX index of implied volatility (VIX) for the S&P 500 -- Wall Street's ""fear gauge"". This spiked to over 50 percent on Feb. 6 in its biggest one-day jump in over two years, and is currently trading at around 18 percent.
A slim majority -- 51 percent -- of those who answered a question on the VIX thought it would end the year below 20 percent, with just under a third saying above 20 percent.
Justin Onuekwusi, a fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management, said increased volatility was classic ""late cycle"" behavior. 
""In this phase, markets become more volatile and more sensitive to drawdowns as positioning becomes more concentrated and investors more trigger-happy to pre-empt the inevitable bear market,"" he said. 
Other managers said it was too difficult to call, but Thomas McDonald, a portfolio manager at Russell Investments, added: ""We view the current bout of extreme volatility to be short-lived and expect equities, after a period of consolidation, to eventually continue on their upward trajectory.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European fund managers cut their global equity holdings to five-month lows in February after a sharp sell-off early in the month that wiped $4 trillion off share prices, but most thought stocks were still likely to test new highs.
Reuters' latest monthly asset allocation poll of 19 European investors was carried out between Feb. 12-26 following a global rout that saw world stocks (MIWO00000PUS) tumble 5.1 percent in their worst week in two years.
The CBOE VIX index of implied volatility (VIX) for the S&P 500 -- Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" -- spiked to 50 on Feb. 6 in its biggest one-day jump in over two years. Both the S&P 500 (SPX) and the Dow Jones (DJI) suffered their biggest percentage drops since August 2011.
Following the correction investors cut their stocks exposure by 1.8 percentage points to 44.2 percent of their global balanced portfolios, the lowest level since September 2017. They raised cash to 6.4 percent, the highest since October.
""The market correction has removed some of the complacency in risk assets, however, we see the potential for further spikes in volatility as markets are still displaying tight valuations,"" said Pascal Blanque, chief investment officer at Amundi.
Global equities are set to end February down 3.5 percent, their first monthly loss since October 2016. Yet around 88 percent of poll participants who answered a question on the equity bull market thought stocks could test new highs, surpassing the peaks scaled in late January.
Jan Bopp, asset allocation strategist at J Safra Sarasin, was among those saying the S&P 500 could close the year higher than January's top.
""Fundamental data is still strong, earnings are solid and the (U.S.) tax reform should give them another boost,"" he said. ""Bear market risk remains relatively low, as we do not expect a continued, sharp deterioration of the growth/inflation mix.""
But poll participants trimmed their U.S. stocks exposure to 37.3 percent of their global equity portfolios, the lowest level since October.
Francois Savary, chief investment officer of Prime Partners, said the second half of the year would be less supportive for U.S. equities, and expressed a preference for Europe, Japan and emerging markets, where he thought the recent highs should be overcome more significantly.
In the poll, investors increased their emerging markets stocks exposure by 1.7 percentage points to 16.3 percent. Most notably, Asia ex-Japan was raised by 2.1 percentage points to 7.4 percent, the highest level since September 2016.
MSCI's benchmark emerging stocks index (MSCIEF) did not escape the global sell-off and looks set to end the month down around 4.4 percent.
The broad-based correction was triggered in early February when U.S. wage growth figures sparked fears the Federal Reserve was behind the curve and would need to increase borrowing costs far more aggressively than expected.
U.S. 10-year Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) leapt to a four-year high of 2.94 percent in mid-February.
Although yields have retreated since, around 69 percent of poll participants who answered a question on this topic thought they would end the year above 3 percent.
""A tight U.S. labor market, emerging capacity constraints, a twin deficit that needs to be financed and the dollar on a longer-term weakening trend suggest Treasury yields could end 2018 above 3 percent,"" said Peter van der Welle, a strategist at Robeco.
Florian Spaete, senior equity strategist at Generali (MI:GASI) Investments, agreed, saying inflation risks were tilted to the upside. He expects three further rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve this year of 25 basis points each.
""As we do not expect the depreciation of the U.S. dollar to be reversed, this calls for a more hawkish stance by the Fed as well,"" he said.

923,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 08:59AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Bayer to win EU approval for $62.5 billion Monsanto deal,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German drug and crop chemicals maker Bayer (DE:BAYGn) is set to win conditional European Union antitrust approval for its $62.5 billion bid for world No. 1 seed company  Monsanto  (N:MON), two people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The takeover, one of a trio of major deals in the agribusiness sector in recent years, would create a company with a share of more than a quarter of the world's seed and pesticides market.
Shifting weather patterns, competition in grain exports and a souring global farm economy have spurred consolidation among the major players, triggering protests from environmental and farming groups worried about their market power.
Bayer has already pledged to sell certain seed and herbicide assets for 5.9 billion euros ($7.2 billion) to BASF (DE:BASFn) to address EU regulatory concerns. 
The company will also give BASF a license to its digital farming data, and it appears BASF will have exclusive access as Bayer has not offered a legal obligation to license to other rivals, a person with knowledge of the matter has told Reuters.
Earlier on Wednesday, Bayer said additional antitrust concessions would include the sale of its vegetable seeds business, confirming a Reuters report.
The European Commission, which is expected to issue a decision on the deal ahead of its April 5 deadline, declined to comment.
Bayer also declined to comment on the sources' comments, saying it continued a constructive dialogue with the EU competition watchdog. It added the regulatory process in Europe was further advanced than in the United States where the deal also requires clearance.
French seeds producer Vilmorin said it would consider taking over some vegetable seed activities put up for sale by Bayer.
""It will depend on the breakdown that will be made. If there are clever and targeted things to do, why not, but if it's all-encompassing then clearly we don't have the profile for it to be accepted by the authorities,"" Vilmorin Chief Executive Daniel Jacquemond told reporters after unveiling first-half results. 
The Bayer-Monsanto tie-up has sparked criticism from environmentalists and some farming groups concerned about its market power and first mover advantage in digital farming data.
Some who met on Tuesday with European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who has received more than 50,000 petition emails and more than 5,000 letters opposed to the deal, were not reassured.
""Approving this merger would create the world's biggest agribusiness company, potentially crushing competitors and establishing an unprecedented monopoly on lucrative farming data,"" said Adrian Bebb at environmental lobbying group Friends of the Earth Europe.
""Public opinion is against the merger, and farmers and consumers would have every right to be outraged by the Commission giving it the green light.""

924,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 12:13PM ET</span>",Lowe's struggles as investments hit margins,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Lowe's Companies Inc's (N:LOW) quarterly profit and margins fell well short of Wall Street estimates on Wednesday as the No. 2 U.S. home improvement chain's heavy spending to convert shoppers' visits into sales did not pay off as much as expected.
The company's shares tumbled 9 percent after Lowe's forecast a drop in margins this year - due to heavy investment in a very competitive U.S. market. 
A forecast that same-store sales growth would also slow this year suggested that investment would not bear fruit soon and left it trailing sector leader  Home Depot .
""We made an investment in the third quarter to bolster conversion rates ... we need to make the incremental investments to ensure that we convert that traffic into transactions,"" Chief Executive Officer Robert Niblock said on a conference call.
Lowes's spent on initiatives such as advertising and home deliveries in its fourth quarter. While that pulled in more shoppers, customer transactions fell 0.8 percent, compared with a 0.7 percent rise in the prior quarter.
Lowe's said that customers bought more appliances, lumber and building materials in the quarter, which BTIG analyst Alan Rifkin said were typically low-margin products.
The company's gross margins fell to 33.73 percent, missing analysts estimates of 34.27 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Operating margins also dropped and Lowe's said it expected a drop of about 30 basis points this year.
Still, shoppers who did spend at Lowe's, shelled out more on average last quarter, though that was also due to more promotions.
That helped same-store sales rise 4.1 percent, topping market expectations. That was well below the 7-percent growth posted by market-leader Home Depot Inc (N:HD), which also reported higher customer transactions and average spend.
Lowe's net sales fell nearly 2 percent to $15.49 billion, but topped estimates of $15.33 billion.
Net income fell 12.5 percent to $554 million. Its adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share were well below analysts' estimate of 87 cents.
The results from the home improvement chain, which also owns Canadian home goods retailer Rona, come at a time when rising mortgage rates and the impact of the U.S. tax reforms on higher-priced homes have begun to worry investors in construction-related businesses.

Lowe's shares were down 6.3 percent at $89.81 in mid-day trading, easing from a session-low of $86.75. Home Depot's shares were little changed.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Toyota to build new Auris car at UK plant in Brexit boost for PM May,"By Costas Pitas
LONDON (Reuters) - Toyota (T:7203) said on Wednesday it will build the next generation of its Auris car in England in a welcome boost to Prime Minister Theresa May as Britain leaves the European Union, confirming a previous Reuters report.
The Japanese carmaker will make its new Auris hatchback at Burnaston, Derbyshire, replacing the current run of the model made there, the company said in a statement.
Sources told Reuters last year that Toyota planned to build the model in Britain on the assumption that ministers will secure a transitional Brexit deal designed to maintain current trading conditions until at least the end of 2020.
The automaker said free trade was important for the future. 
""With around 85 percent of our UK vehicle production exported to European markets, continued free and frictionless trade between the UK and Europe will be vital for future success,"" said Toyota Europe President and CEO Johan van Zyl in Wednesday's statement. 
Business minister Greg Clark hailed the announcement and said Britain's automotive sector was one of the most productive in the world, adding ""this government will continue work to create the best possible environment.""
Carmakers are worried that without the right Brexit deal, their factories could be subject to tariffs and trade barriers, adding to costs and risking the long-term viability of sites. 
Toyota's Burnaston plant churned out 144,000 models last year, down 20 percent from 2016 according to industry data, as its current line-up of models neared the end of their product life cycle.

Nearly one in five of those cars were Avensis models, according to a source familiar with the situation. The firm did not comment on the future of the model in its statement on Wednesday. A spokesman did not immediately respond to a phone call and email requesting comment on the matter.

Paz, 54, is a vice president and head of Bezeq's business division. His appointment came at a special board meeting.
Handler was arrested last week in connection with an investigation into allegations that include fraud, bribery and securities offences. She was released from police custody to house arrest on Monday until March 4 while a court ordered she stay away from Bezeq for 30 days.
Along with Handler, Bezeq's controlling shareholder and former chairman Shaul Elovitch and a number of other officials connected to Bezeq were arrested. Most have been released from custody although Elovitch remains in detention.
They all deny any wrongdoing.
Elovitch said on Monday he would step down from the board as would his son and daughter-in-law, a step sought by minority shareholders in the wake of the investigation by Israel's markets regulator that began last year.

Elovitch, a family friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, controls Bezeq through Eurocom.

The toy retailer has struggled in Britain in recent years as shoppers increasingly prefer to spend online rather than visit its large out-of-town stores.
Moorfields Advisory said that all stores were to continue trading until further notice, but that the company had entered administration after an ""unsuccessful attempt to sell its business as a going concern."" 
""We will be conducting an orderly wind-down of the store portfolio over the coming weeks... We will make every effort to secure a buyer for all or part of the business,"" Simon Thomas, joint administrator and partner at Moorfields, said in a statement.
""Whilst this process is likely to affect many Toys R Us staff, whether some or all of the stores will close remains to be decided."" 
Toys R Us operates more than 100 stores in Britain and also trades as Babies R Us. Moorfields said that the administration did not affect the global operations of Toys R Us outside the UK.
Creditors of the British arm of the chain had backed a restructuring plan in December in a bid to stave off administration.

Overnight, U.S. stocks suffered their biggest daily drops since a selloff three weeks ago, after comments from new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell changed investors' perceptions of the pace of U.S. ""monetary normalization"". 
""This was a clear shot across the bows from the new Chair, suggesting that – if it is up to him – the FOMC may want to revise its current projections of three hikes for this year up to include a fourth,"" Rabobank commented.
For many analysts, the early February correction that shares around the globe had its roots in the fact that after years of ultra-loose monetary policy, bond yields are catching up to a new economic environment. 
That lowers the equity risk premium - the price paid to compensate the risk of investing in stocks rather than in bonds.
Results from European corporates on Wednesday failed to lift investors' spirits.
France's  Biomerieux  (PA:BIOX) was the biggest faller after publishing disappointing annual results, dropping about 9 percent. 
In the same sector, German drugmaker Bayer's (DE:BAYGn) lost 3.3 percent as earnings were dragged lower by discounts to crop protection distributors in Brazil. It also said it needed more time to wrap up the planned takeover of U.S. seeds giant  Monsanto  (N:MON).
Belgium'  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) also lost some ground, down 2.2 percent as it forecast lower growth in 2018, with a fall in profitability at its traditional chemicals business.
Better news came from Dutch-Belgian supermarket operator Ahold Delhaize (AS:AD) which expects to save roughly 200 million euros from U.S. tax cuts this year. Its shares rose 2.1 percent. 
In the banking sector, EFG International (S:EFGN) fell 8.7 percent after reporting a worse-than-expected full year net loss as it absorbed integration costs from its takeover of rival Swiss private bank BSI.
Austrian lender Erste Group (VI:ERST) got a better market response to its earnings and jumped 3.6 percent. Its net profits were buoyed by a rise in interest rates in eastern Europe and steady growth in banking fees and lending income.
In the UK,  ITV  (L:ITV) lost 7.5 percent. The British broadcaster reported a 5 percent drop in adjusted full-year earnings, reflecting a tough advertising environment.

Dialog Semiconductor (DE:DLGS) led gainers with a 7.9 percent rise after it published its results.

946,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 04:17AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Amid liquidity concerns, China's HNA Group aviation fuel bill hits $476 million - sources","By Chen Aizhu and Matthew Miller
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's HNA Group has amassed an estimated 3 billion yuan ($476 million) bill with a state-run aviation fuel company, two oil industry sources said, underscoring how a deepening cash crunch is plaguing core operations at the conglomerate.
HNA's outstanding balance with China National Aviation Fuel Group Ltd (CNAF), the country's near-monopoly marketer and distributor of aviation fuel, has swelled significantly over the last six months, the sources said, without quantifying.
""HNA has not stopped fully paying its bills, but it only has paid a small amount at a time, so the outstanding (balance) has grown bigger and bigger,"" said a senior oil industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter.
A second executive briefed on the situation said the problem ""really deteriorated over the past several months"". 
Both executives requested anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the matter.
HNA has controlling stakes in Hainan Airlines Holding Co (SS:600221) and 12 other carriers in China and Hong Kong. 
The company also has invested heavily in aviation leasing, logistics and financial services, taking leading stakes in  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and Old Mutual's asset management unit (K:OMAM).
HNA Group said in a statement on Wednesday Hainan Airlines ""maintained positive and friendly communication"" with CNAF. ""At present, all businesses are carried out steadily,"" it added, without elaborating.  
The unpaid bills underscore how an ongoing liquidity squeeze is rippling through company core operations, impacting even its highly successful airlines business.
Some HNA airlines have delayed payments for leased aircrafts, Reuters reported last month, prompting executives from leasing units of Bank of China Ltd (SS:601988), China Minsheng Banking Corp <6000016.SS>, and Bank of Communications Co (SS:601328) to hold recovery talks.
""HNA and its subsidiaries are maintaining stable operations, and are in the process of gradually paying each lessor's fees as planned,"" the company said at the time.
Earlier this month, S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit profile of HNA Group and two of its units, including airline caterer Gategroup, citing a ""deteriorating liquidity profile"".
Dublin-based aircraft leasing firm Avolon Holdings, acquired by HNA subsidiary Bohai Capital Holding (SZ:000415) two years ago for about $2.5 billion, also took the unprecedented step of amending its guarantee structure, formalizing segregation of its financial resources from HNA and its units. 
HNA is also seeking to restructure its far-flung operations following $50 billion investment spree, while raising cash by selling equity and prime real estate assets. Among its recent divestments are a Sydney office tower and two plots of land in Hong Kong.
GROWING BILL
State-run CNAF supplies fuel at about 215 airports in China, and 46 airports globally.
The fuel supplier became acutely of HNA's problems in late September when HNA's liquidity problems ""started to erupt"", said one of the executives. 
The sources estimated HNA's outstanding bill to CNAF now amounted to about 3 billion yuan. That represented about four months worth of total billing to the group, one of the sources added. 
CNAF has responded by setting up a task force to explore repayment options, the two executives said.  
""CNAF has initiated many exchanges with HNA, verbally and in writing, but that has been barely fruitful,"" the executive said. 
Solutions proposed by the fuel supplier have included swapping the debt for a stake in Meilan Haikou Airport, which is controlled by HNA, the first executive said.
CNAF has continued to supply fuel to HNA airlines, concerned about the impact of suspending sales for airlines that make hundreds of international and domestic flights every day.
""(Ironically) it's now CNAF's social responsibility to keep its flights running, because if fuel is suspended, passengers will be hurt and then it becomes a social problem,"" said the first executive.
China's central government state assets regulator and the Civil Aviation Administration have been briefed on the matter, but neither has given clear guidance over how to sort out the situation, the executives said.
The two bodies did not immediately responded to requests for comment.
A CNAF spokesperson, contacted by Reuters, acknowledged the company has amassed a ""sizeable"" outstanding bill since the second half of last year, but declined to elaborate.

""Communications with HNA are under way,"" the spokesperson said. ""It's hard to predict results, but we're hoping for a solution.""

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Waymo on Wednesday showed off a 360-degree video to help people envision what it is like to ride inside an autonomous vehicle, as the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc company on the cusp of launching self-driving rides with real people hopes to win over potential passengers.
Waymo said in a blog post that it had driven more than 5 million miles (8.05 million km) on public roads, doubling its miles since January 2017, when it unveiled its improved self-driving system installed in Chrysler Pacifica minivans at the Detroit auto show.
Waymo's blog linked to a 3-minute, 36-second video posted on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8R148hFxPw). It comes ahead of what will be Waymo's first foray into ride hailing with no human behind the steering wheel in Phoenix, Arizona, in coming months.
Convincing a potentially wary public of the merits - and safety - of self-driving is a key goal of Waymo, considered a pioneer in the global race to deploy autonomous vehicles.
A Gallup poll published last week found that 54 percent of the 3,297 U.S. respondents said they were ""unlikely"" to use self-driving cars, with 59 percent saying they would feel uncomfortable riding in one. The survey was conducted in September and October. 
Large tech companies, big automakers and well-funded startups have been testing such cars, but for the most part real passengers have not yet been added to the mix. Experts believe self-driving cars used in fleets for ride hailing services are among the most economically viable ways to deploy such technology broadly.
The state of Arizona has no restrictions on self-driving cars, which has made it a key testing ground for the technology.
Waymo said in November that members of the public using a ride-hailing app would be able to ride in its fleet of minivans in ensuing months. At first, a Waymo employee would accompany the passengers in the backseat, but eventually they will travel alone. The company has been testing its cars in Arizona with an employee in the back seat and no one at the wheel since October.

The passenger service is expected to roll out in more geographical areas in the United States, at a later, unannounced date.

Li Shufu, Geely's founder and main owner, revealed on Friday he had built up a 9.7 percent stake in Daimler, the owner of the Mercedes-Benz brand, without having previously disclosed that he had crossed regulatory thresholds of 3 and 5 percent.
""Against the backdrop of the current case, the federal government will examine whether the existing rules are sufficient to provide an adequate level of transparency, or if further guidelines are necessary,"" an Economy Ministry report to the economics committee of the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, seen by Reuters said on Wednesday.
Any decisions on the matter would be made by the new German coalition government.
Geely worked with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), which declined to comment, to help secure a 9.69 percent voting stake using derivatives to help skirt disclosure requirements, two people familiar with the deal told Reuters.
The stake purchase has rekindled fears in Germany of its highly-prized expertise falling into Chinese hands.
Germany tightened disclosure policies to prevent ""sneak attacks"" from succeeding after carmaker Porsche in 2008 accumulated a stake of around 30 percent in Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) while keeping investors in the dark.
Porsche used ""cash-settled options"" to buy the stake by stealth. The buyer of regular stock options gets the right to buy or sell stock at a certain price by a certain date.
But in cash-settled options, as the name implies, the buyer gets the right not to stock itself but the cash difference between the options' ""strike price"" and the market price of the shares when the options are exercised.
German auto-parts supplier Schaeffler (DE:SHA_p) did something similar, secretly cornering about a third of the shares of larger rival Continental (DE:CONG).
Some investors complained that Porsche and Schaeffler had crossed the boundaries of fair play, taking advantage of disclosure rules that were too loose and regulators that were too tentative.

""Hidden ownership to try to avoid disclosure of large stakes, if successful, creates a uneven playing field. It would undermine the interests of investors and target companies, and be inconsistent with the core values of transparency,"" said Henry Hu, Allan Shivers Chair in the Law of Banking and Finance at the University of Texas at Austin.

Hapoalim said it had determined that more of its clients may be relevant to the investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Its provisions for the investigation now stand at $343 million, Hapoalim said in a statement.
The bank estimates ""that its overall exposure is higher than the amount of the provision it expects to include in its financial reports for 2017,"" it said. 
Hapoalim added that the latest amount to be set aside was not final and could change by the time it publishes its financial results on March 26.
Israel's banking regulator in September ordered lenders to reduce their overseas operations and keep a closer eye on subsidiaries to better comply with risk and compliance rules.
The clamp-down came in response to the Hapoalim investigation and similar cases with lenders Leumi (TA:LUMI) and  Mizrahi Tefahot  (TA:MZTF).

Leumi paid $400 million in fines to U.S. authorities in late 2014.

953,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 02:05AM ET</span>",Bunge's coveted Argentina plants lure ADM takeover approach,"By Hugh Bronstein and P.J. Huffstutter
ROSARIO, Argentina/CHICAGO (Reuters) - On the banks of the Parana River, machines hum 24 hours a day in Argentina's grain ports, churning out soy-based animal feed and shooting it straight into the hulls of ships bound for buyers worldwide.
The wind stirs up fine meal dust, creating a protein-filled haze. Rosario is the biggest soy-crushing hub in the Americas, where 22 plants process 157,500 tonnes of soybeans per day into soyoil and feed that fattens livestock in markets from the United Kingdom to Indonesia.
These plants are a key reason why top U.S. grains merchant Archer Daniels Midland Co (N:ADM) is attempting a takeover of longtime rival and soy-crushing powerhouse  Bunge  Ltd (N:BG), industry executives, analysts and grains trading sources told Reuters. The deal, estimated at $16 billion, would be the biggest ever by one of the world's four agricultural trading giants.
ADM and Bunge are the ""A"" and ""B"" of the so-called ""ABCD"" group of firms that dominate global grains trading, along with Cargill and Dreyfus.
ADM's advance on the financially faltering Bunge reflects larger profit pressures across the grains sector amid a global glut now entering its fifth year, holding commodity prices at sustained multi-year lows. Such conditions are widely expected to drive a wave of consolidation among agricultural firms.
ADM is the only one of the ABCDs that has no crushing capacity in Argentina, where Bunge has four plants.
""Where is the value in Bunge from ADM’s point of view? It is in South America, including crushing and elevator capacity in Argentina,"" said a Buenos Aires market source with knowledge of the situation.
ADM would also take on Bunge assets in Brazil, which include factories, mills, silos, distribution centers and port terminals. Bunge is bigger than ADM in Brazil as well as in Argentina.
Juan Luciano, the Argentina-born CEO of U.S.-based ADM, told investors this month that ADM aims ""to plug holes in our value chain"", although he made no reference to reports the firm has approached Bunge.
""The hole in their value chain is called Argentina, because ADM hasn't any crushing facilities here,"" said Buenos Aires-based August Remijsen, former Southern Cone chief executive of trading group Toepfer, which was recently absorbed by ADM. ""The most efficient crushers in the world are located in Argentina.""
Representatives of ADM and Bunge declined to comment on the reported merger talks. Bunge last year turned down overtures from Switzerland-based  Glencore  (L:GLEN).
Argentina is the world's top exporter of soymeal and soyoil, used for cooking and making biodiesel. Most is shipped from Rosario, located in the Pampas farm belt.
The nation's massive soy crushers and grains elevators are right next to the deeply dredged Parana. The set-up offers logistical advantages over the United States and Brazil, where moving grains involves more costly ground transportation and loading products on and off barges.
LOSSES MAKE BUNGE A TARGET
Bunge, founded in 1818 in the Netherlands, is the world's top industrial producer of soymeal and soyoil. But a series of quarterly losses have made the storied firm vulnerable to a takeover, analysts said.
""It's the inexorable path ahead, because it would be hard for Bunge to reverse a full year of losses,"" said Pablo Adreani, head of Argentine farm industry consultancy Agripac.
Argentina has launched reforms meant to attract foreign investors under business-friendly President Mauricio Macri, who is lowering export taxes on soybean meal and soybean oil.
Bunge exported 11.2 percent of the 32.8 million tonnes of soymeal shipped from Argentina last year, and 7.8 percent of the 5.9 million tonnes in vegetable oils, according to agriculture ministry data.
About 60 percent of Argentine soyoil went to India and Bangladesh last year, emerging markets where ADM is keen to increase access. Soymeal was destined mainly for Vietnam, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and Italy.
ADM exported 9.1 percent of the overall 47.9 million tonnes of raw grains shipped from Argentina in 2017, close to Bunge's 9.7 percent. A combination of the two firms would be Argentina's No. 1 raw grains exporter, a title currently held by COFCO-Nidera, which combined early last year to capture 17 percent of the market.
Under this scenario, Dreyfus would be left in the dust with 9.5 percent of the 2017 raw grains export market.
But the ADM-Bunge tie-up could face regulatory scrutiny in the United States, where ADM is already the largest grain merchant. The biggest overlap between ADM and Bunge in the United States is in grain origination and oilseeds processing, and regulators could force ADM to divest substantial assets as a condition of approval, according to antitrust experts.
The firms would have to overcome opposition from U.S. farmers who fear that giving more market share to ADM could hurt wheat, corn and soybean prices, said Peter Carstensen, who teaches antitrust law at the University of Wisconsin Law School.
The deal could also face opposition from farmer groups in key agricultural markets, including the European Union, China, India and Brazil, he said.
Regulators in Argentina would also have to approve any deal. A spokesman for the country's regulators declined to comment on the matter.
DREDGING CUTS THE PATH
Ocean-going vessels can reach the crushing plants that dot the banks of the Parana because the river is dredged to a depth of at least 34 feet from the port of Timbues, just north of Rosario, to Buenos Aires, 287 miles (462 km) to the south.
Bunge can process 18,000 tonnes of soybeans at its Rosario area facilities every day, according to the local grains exchange. At the current export price, that means Bunge can crush $7.3 million worth of soybeans in 24 hours.
Despite the industry's sustained bout with oversupply and low prices, the soymeal business has room to grow, said Adreani, the farm analyst. That's because a growing world population - now approaching eight billion - will continue to drive demand for meal-fed beef and pork, he said.

""ADM is looking at the advantage it would have over the 15 or 20 years ahead,"" Adreani said. ""It's a smart strategy.""

954,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>",Russian stocks to inch higher by end of 2018: Reuters poll,"By Zlata Garasyuta
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's stock market is seen posting moderate gains for the rest of 2018, shrugging off the likely re-election of President Vladimir Putin but kept in check by tepid economic growth and geopolitical risks, a Reuters poll found.
The dollar-denominated benchmark RTS index (IRTS) is seen rising to 1,356 points by the end of the year, 2.7 percent higher than Tuesday afternoon's levels, according to the consensus forecast of market analysts.
The market's upside has vanished compared with the week to Feb. 23 when the poll was held, as the RTS rallied to 1,339.4 on Monday, its highest since mid-July 2014, pricing in Russia's sovereign rating upgrade by S&P Global.
By the middle of the year the index is forecast to be sitting at 1,320, according to an average forecast of five out of 10 analysts polled. The last poll, conducted in October, predicted the RTS would be at 1,151 by the middle of 2018.
Any change to the Western sanctions on Russia first imposed in 2014 for Moscow's role in the Ukrainian crisis could of course alter the market's prospects.
On the other hand, a presidential vote on March 18 where Putin is widely expected to secure another term is unlikely to cause major market moves, analysts said.
""We expect a neutral dynamic on the Russian market as the presidential election theme worries the market slightly. We are unlikely to see major moves after the election: Foreign investors got used to one surname,"" said Victor Veselov, chief analyst at Globex Bank.
Danske Bank said it anticipates no rally on the Russian market this year but a gradual increase after the U.S. Treasury department advised against imposing sanctions on holdings of Russian state debt earlier in February.
""It is important to avoid sparks of geopolitical conflicts as in this case, unfortunately, risks can be only negative,"" said BCS analysts.
Analysts in the poll also said they expected to see support for the stock market from the central bank's monetary policy. The bank is seen cutting interest rates further, making lending cheaper and thus supporting economic activity and demand.
The Russian economy grew 1.5 percent in 2017, below the global average, after two years of recession caused by a slump in prices for oil, its key export, and Western economic and financial sanctions.
Prices for oil remain in focus after Brent crude futures (LCOc1) exceeded $70 per barrel in early 2018, up from around $55 in the same period a year earlier.
""If there is no substantial decline in oil prices, market participants will increase their profit forecasts,"" said Andrey Kuznetsov, a strategist at Sberbank CIB.
""According to our estimates, the market on average is pricing in an oil price of $55 a barrel,"" Kuznetsov said.

Powell said in his first public testimony that he expected the economy to be strong during the next two years and that his personal outlook for growth has firmed since the end of last year. Powell’s comments added to concerns that the Fed was rethinking its plan to add a fourth rate hike this year, instead of three, to contain inflation.
The Dow closed 1.2% lower and the S&P 500 Index dropped 1.3% on Tuesday, while 10-year Treasury yields climbed back up to 2.90% and the dollar stood at almost a three-week high against a basket of currencies after Powell’s upbeat view.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped further into negative territory and closed 1.4% lower. The Bank of Japan was partly in focus as it cut its 25-year Japanese government bonds (JGB) buys to 70 billion yen, compared to 80 billion yen in its last market operation.
The economic calendar was also in focus as Japan’s January industrial production fell 6.6% MoM compared to the 4.2% decrease forecasts. Retail sales for the month also missed estimates, down a seasonally adjusted 1.8% MoM versus forecasts for a decline of 0.6%.
Mainland Chinese markets were mixed, with the Shanghai Composite retreated 0.8% while SZSE Component gained 0.53% by 1:30am ET. The country’s February manufacturing PMI expanded less than expected and came in at 50.3, compared to the estimate of 51.1. Non-manufacturing PMI stood at 54.4, also below the forecasted 55.0. Reports suggested that the long Lunar New Year break in mid-February may be to blame for the slowdown and expected output to improve in the coming months.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also traded 1.7% lower. Auto maker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175) made headlines as German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no sign of violations in the acquisition of Daimler’s stake. The company’s shares outperformed the market and jumped 3.0% Wednesday.

LONDON (Reuters) - European share indexes will by the end of the year revisit the levels they hit in January before diving in February on fears of inflation and interest rates rising faster than expected, particularly in the United States, a Reuters poll showed.
Shares are seen bouncing back on strong corporate earnings and global growth, the poll of strategists showed. They said the factors that supported European markets in 2017 will keep doing so even if the market is now more volatile.
The poll of more than 30 brokers, fund managers and analysts taken over the last two weeks showed the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) is expected to reach 405 points at the end of 2018, against a year-high of 403.7 points on Jan. 23. 
That would mean a 4 percent rise for the year, much smaller than 2017's 7.7 percent gain. Compared with Monday's close it would mark a 5.7 percent improvement. 
For the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index, (STOXX50E) the expected rise on the year is 5.6 percent, 6.8 percent up on Monday's close. 
""What Anglo-Saxons call Goldilocks has ended; we're entering a new period now"", said Warin Buntrock, deputy chief investment officer at BFT IM, evoking the ""not too hot, not too cold"" analogy used to describe a satisfactory pace of economic growth which does not fuel inflationary fears.
After years of ultra-loose monetary policy, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates three times in 2018 and the Bank of England possibly twice, while the European Central Bank is set to end quantitative easing by the end of the year. 
With bond yields now catching up to this new environment, the so-called ""equity risk premium"" -- the price paid to compensate for taking the risk of investing in stocks rather than in bonds -- has had a negative effect on stocks.
Buntrock said he expected European shares to grow at around the same pace as corporate earnings, that is roughly 10 percent, with little or no inflation on the earnings multiples used to value shares.
This new economic environment will be much more prone to market volatility, which had stabilized at record lows in 2017.
The Reuters poll also shows investors are bracing for much less stable markets, with the VIX index (VIX), a gauge of U.S. stocks volatility, rising through the year with occasional abrupt spikes.
While political risks remain in Europe, particularly in Italy which holds a general election on Sunday, investors take the view that they are unlikely to affect markets over the year.
Milan's FTSE MIB (FTMIB) is seen rising almost 10 percent in 2018 while Germany's DAX (GDAXI) would go up over 7 percent. France's CAC (FCHI) will end the year 4.1 percent higher than it started it.
Britain's FTSE (FTSE), which equity strategists believe could suffer from lower growth and the country's exit from the European Union, is the only indicator seen closing 2018 with a negative performance, down 2.4 percent.

They cut their suggested equity allocations to 76.3 percent from 76.9 percent a month earlier, according to a poll of eight China-based fund managers conducted this week. 
The fund managers have boosted their suggested bond allocations for the coming three months to 8.8 percent from 6.9 percent last month.
They have lowered recommended cash allocations to 15 percent from 16.3 percent. 
""The A-share market, after having made robust gains in the previous months, tracked steep losses on Wall Street in early February,"" said a South China-based fund manager.
""For the moment, we see more upside risks than downside risks, considering more resilience in China's economy and moderate valuations in the A-share market as a whole,"" he added.
Market participants were keeping a close watch on the impact of certain amendments to the wording of China's constitution.
China's ruling Communist Party on Sunday set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely, with a proposal to remove a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to just two terms in office.
""The possible extension of Xi's tenure could help ensure political stability and would be good for promoting deeper and wider economic reforms,"" said Yang Hongxun, a Shanghai-based analyst at investment consultancy Shandong Shenguang.
Yang's view was echoed by brokerage Everbright Sun Hung Kai, which said a more powerful Xi could make policy implementation more efficient, for example, at local government and state-owned enterprise levels.
However, another fund manager surveyed was cautious.
""Despite a recent strong rally in the A-share market, we could still see potential risks ahead, including possible rate hikes in China and U.S., and major correction in overseas markets,"" he said.
Overall, the fund managers surveyed were bullish on asset allocations for the next month, with three suggesting an increase, one suggesting a cut, while four recommended the same level of equity exposure.
According to the poll, average recommended allocations for electronic stocks in the next three months were boosted to 15.9 percent from 12.8 percent the previous month, those for financial shares were cut to 18.8 percent from 21.9 percent, while those for real estate firms were reduced to 7.5 percent from 10.3 percent last month.
The financial and property sectors, where institutional investors ""huddled together for warmth"", were dumped during the broad selloff ahead of the Lunar New Year break, while growth stocks including electronic stocks were favored recently, fund managers pointed out.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) on Wednesday rejected assertions that Australia's four major banks are highly profitable, contradicting the government's chief economic advisory body which earlier this month said the banks were too powerful. 
Australia's second-largest bank by market size said that despite the ""Big Four"" - Westpac, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) - producing large profits, their return on equity had fallen over the past decade. 
""It is true that, as a sector, we make large dollar profits, but that does not necessarily equate to being highly profitable,"" CFO Peter King told the country's productivity commission. 
""The returns do not stand out compared to Australia's largest listed entities and are in-line with other leading and comparable banking systems globally.""
The Big Four hold about 80 percent of the Australian banking market, according to the commission. 
They have come under fire over allegations of misleading financial advice, insurance fraud and interest-rate rigging, and accusations of breaching anti-money laundering rules.
A government-backed inquiry is set to start scrutinizing their lending practices from next month.
Research published ahead of the inquiry said the four major banks were among the most profitable lenders in the world, earning profit margins of 36.4 percent in the June quarter of 2017. Returns on equity after tax were 13.6 percent. 
The Productivity Commission has said the Big Four are more profitable than their smaller rivals, partly because the banking regulator had focused on stability at the expense of competition.
Westpac posted a record cash profit of A$8.06 billion ($6.3 billion) for the year ended Sept. 30, missing market expectations. Its net interest margin, a barometer of profitability, was down 4 basis points to 2.06 percent as competition eroded the benefits of higher mortgage rates.

Australia's major banks have posted record profits for years on the back or mortgage lending, but they are now starting to feel the pinch of a softening property market, weak retail sales, heightened competition and tighter regulation.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 11:20PM ET</span>",Why Oppenheimer Global fund is focusing on biotech as rates rise,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The recent volatility in the global stock market may make some investors feel queasy, but it is providing a buying opportunity in biotechnology stocks.
That is because biotechs will see little impact from rising interest rates because investors are more focused on the long-term potential of their drugs, said Rajeev Bhaman, portfolio manager of the $11.8 billion Oppenheimer Global fund. 
Bhaman, whose fund received a 2018 U.S. Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award in the global large-cap growth fund category in New York on Tuesday, is focusing on companies such as Sage Therapeutics Inc (O:SAGE), Bluebird Bio Inc (O:BLUE) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:IONS) whose drugs can have multiple uses rather than pinpointing a specific ailment. 
""We look for things that have multiple ways to win once a proof of concept is worked out, so you have multiple shots at the apple,"" he said. 
Sage Therapeutics, for instance, may be the first company to bring a drug to treat postpartum depression to market after it succeeded in two late-stage studies in November. That same drug will likely also serve as an option to treat mild to medium general depression, Bhaman said. 
Sage, which hit a 52-week high of $195.97 on Jan. 31, currently trades around $163.50 a share. 
The focus on biotechnology stocks comes as the sector has proven to be more volatile than the broad market. Investors are moving away from companies perceived as risky in light of expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least three times this year. 
The Nasdaq Biotechnology index fell 12.7 percentage points from its high this year, compared with a 10.9 percent decrease in the broad S&P 500. Biotech stocks are now up 3.9 percent for the year, slightly ahead of the S&P 500. 
BOND PROXIES
While the prospect of increasing interest rates rattled the stock market in early February, Bhaman said that he expects there to be little effect on his portfolio overall because he has largely avoided companies that have served as bond proxies. Instead, he is looking for companies that have some level of innovation that gives them pricing power, a mindset that leaves him largely out of the energy and utility sectors. 
Unique among growth-focused investors, Bhaman is also focused on companies that have a strength that has not yet been recognized by the market, a mindset more typical among value-oriented investors. As a result, he does not own any shares of Apple Inc (O:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), or Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) because their strengths are already reflected in their share prices. 
""Absolutely Amazon is a company that I would have loved to own but the valuation seemed too crazy for me,"" he said. 
Bhaman began adding shares of credit reporting company  Equifax Inc  (N:EFX) when its stock plunged in September after a data breach that exposed personal information of nearly 146 million Americans because its valuation looked more reasonable, he said. The company's shares remain down nearly 20 percent from their early September highs. 

""People thought that there was no business anymore, but we liked the business and structure and didn't believe the injury was fatal,"" he said. ""This is the bread and butter of our business. We live for this.""

961,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 10:47AM ET</span>","Top stockpicker T. Rowe Price has boosted bonds, cash allocations","By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Winning stockpicker T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW) has a message for investors: do not give up on bonds.
""We've been lowering our allocation to stocks and have increased our allocation to bonds as well as cash,"" in multi-asset portfolios, said Charles Shriver, co-head of the Asset Allocation Committee at T. Rowe Price, describing changes over the past ""several quarters.""
T. Rowe Price's target-date retirement funds for 2015, 2020, 2025 and 2030 were recognized at the 2018 U.S. Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Awards on Tuesday for their performance over three, five or 10 years. Two of the funds received trophies for their performance in every one of those time periods.
""We have been reducing the risk profile in our portfolios,"" Shriver told Reuters.
The near-decade-long bull market in U.S. stocks has beefed up the average investor's stock holdings, he said, and it may make sense for some investors to decrease their risk. Stocks are still expensive relative to their long-run records, according to Shriver.
It may be a tough message to swallow for investors smarting from fixed-income losses. The average ""core"" bond fund posted a 1.9 percent decline this year, through Feb. 23, according to Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit.
Investors are concerned that the U.S. Federal Reserve could be forced to raise rates more quickly than anticipated to prevent the economy overheating. Those fears have helped lift bond yields, pushing prices down. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes (US10YT=RR) traded as high as 2.957 percent this year, from a low of 2.016 percent in 2017.
Billionaire Warren Buffett on Saturday warned that high-grade bonds can increase the risk of an investment portfolio as inflation eats away at the return.
Bonds will nonetheless retain their ""role as a diversifier,"" Shriver said. Bond prices tend not to move in the same direction of stocks over time, a divergence that helps investors stay invested and which Shriver expects to continue.
Target-date funds, including those managed by T. Rowe Price, hold both stocks and bonds, with the proportion of debt instruments typically increasing as an investor nears retirement.
With bond yields rising, so too is the reward for sitting in short-term bonds and cash.
""You are getting compensated for liquidity,"" said Shriver.

He said T. Rowe Price also sees relative bargains in Europe and Japan's stock markets. The asset manager has also been increasing its allocation to small-capitalization stocks, which Shriver said could benefit from U.S. corporate tax cuts.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dan Ivascyn, the group chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co (Pimco), eschews making big, splashy investment or market calls, unlike his legendary predecessor, Bill Gross. 
""It is never only one person,"" Ivascyn said in an interview, about investment ideas and fresh strategies. ""Even those who use 'I' a lot have very good teams that do the heavy-lifting."" 
Pimco's emphasis on generating strong long-term risk-adjusted returns has been the key factor behind the success of the Pimco Income Fund (PIMIX), which on Tuesday captured the 2018 U.S. Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award in the multi-sector income category over a 10-year period.
Pimco Income, overseen by Ivascyn and managing director and portfolio manager Alfred Murata, is No. 1 in its category with annualized returns of 9.14 percent over the last 10 years ended Feb. 26. Over the same period annualized, the Pimco Income fund has surpassed the benchmark Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. Aggregate Bond index by 3.74 percentage points. 
Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at New York-based CFRA Research, said: ""The fund has less interest-rate sensitivity than peers and the (Barclays) Agg, while offering more exposure to strong performing high-yield bonds."" He added that the Pimco Income fund had ""balanced risk-and-reward"" better than its peers. 
Pimco Income, whose assets have grown to the current $110 billion from $70 billion at the end of 2016, has become the biggest U.S. actively managed bond fund and is considered Pimco's new flagship fund by investors and Wall Street analysts.
""We have a solid team and constantly focus on enhancing our process,"" Ivascyn said.
The Pimco Income fund's increase in fees at the start of the fourth quarter last year did not deter investors. The fund raised its fees by 5 cents per $100 on Oct. 2 for most share classes, bringing expenses for the institutional-class shares to 50 cents per $100. 
""The fund benefited in 2017 from its exposure to mortgage bonds as well as investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds,"" Rosenbluth said.
Lipper also recognized Pimco's Short-Term, Foreign Bond and StockPlus funds for their 10-year records in the respective ultra-short obligation, international income and equity categories.
Pimco, a unit of Germany’s Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE, has seen its assets under management recover dramatically since Gross' abrupt exit in September 2014. As of December 2017, Pimco had $1.75 trillion under management, up from $1.52 trillion as of June 30, 2015 - but still down from $1.92 trillion at the beginning of 2014.
Ivascyn said Newport Beach, California-based Pimco still makes big, bold economic and investment calls but there is no burning desire to publicize them as Gross did. 
In January, Gross, who is the manager of the Janus Henderson Global Unconstrained Bond fund, said bonds have entered a ""mild bear market."" 
Gross said the bear market will not be the extreme inverse of the 30-year bull market, where interest rates declined from 15 percent to below 2 percent. 

""These concepts lead to great sound bites but have very little impact on actually making money for clients,"" Ivascyn said.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 10:20PM ET</span>",India stocks to recover most losses on solid earnings growth:Reuters poll,"By Kailash Mohan Bathija and Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian stocks will recover most of their recent losses, helped by strong corporate earnings, but will close out 2018 a little short of the record high hit at the end of January, a Reuters poll found.
After gaining almost 28 percent in 2017, the BSE Sensex index (BSESN) rose to a record high of 36,443.98 in January, but is down more than 5 percent since then and is expected to end the year under that lifetime high.
The projected rise in 2018 is the smallest year-ahead expected gain in the last six years of Reuters polls.
The recent decline in Indian shares was led by the government's decision to introduce a long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) on stocks in its budget in February.
Indian shares continued falling, tracking a sell-off in global equities, driven by worries about inflation, sending U.S. Treasury yields to a four-year high on expectations of faster interest rate rises from the Federal Reserve.
But world stocks have recovered more than two-thirds of those losses.
The BSE Sensex index (BSESN) is forecast to rise to 34,687 by the middle of the year. It is estimated to rise more than 4 percent to 35,875 by end-2018 from Monday's close of 34,445.75, according to the poll of around 50 strategists taken Feb. 16-27.
That is an upgrade from consensus forecasts made in a Reuters poll in October.
Those gains are expected to be driven by an increase in company earnings as the economy picks up momentum this year after slowing for much of 2017 as disruptions from a ban on bank notes and a goods and services tax fade.
A separate Reuters poll forecast India's economy to grow at its fastest pace in a year in the October-December quarter as consumers, businesses and the government stepped up spending.
The latest report on earnings showed profits in major Indian companies rose at their best pace in six quarters during July-September. Profits are looking up after a prolonged spell of sluggish growth and are expected to increase further this year.
Nearly 90 percent of over 50 analysts who answered a separate question said corporate earnings would increase in the coming quarters. Five respondents expect them to stay the same and only one analyst sees a decline.
""The long overdue correction at a time when earnings are improving creates opportunities to buy. Stocks will be buoyed by an increase in earnings growth this year as disruptions from the GST have started to fade and economic activity gains momentum,"" said B.V. Rudramurthy, managing director at Vachana Investments.
""The increase in company profits should also justify the valuations for a majority of stocks. However, a rise in interest rates dampening fund flows should not be ignored.""
While the global equity sell-off pushed FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investments) to pull a lot of money out of Indian stocks, they still remain net buyers so far in 2018.
But nearly 60 percent of more than 45 respondents who answered an extra question said FIIs would be net sellers this year. 
Most strategists said the biggest risk to their forecasts was global monetary policy tightening.
Those expectations come despite policymakers being split on the outlook for inflation and how the lack of it might affect the future pace of interest rate increases, policy and, in turn, economic growth and financial markets.
Equity strategists also expressed concern about inflation from higher energy prices and expectations of increased rural spending by the government in its latest budget.

Powell said in his first public testimony that he expected the economy to be strong during the next two years and that his personal outlook for growth has firmed since the end of last year. Powell’s comments added to concerns that the Fed was rethinking its plan to add a fourth rate hike this year, instead of three, to contain inflation.
The Dow closed 1.2% lower and the S&P 500 Index dropped 1.3% on Tuesday, while 10-year Treasury yields climbed back up to 2.90% and the dollar stood at almost a three-week high against a basket of currencies after Powell’s upbeat view.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 slipped 0.5% by 9:30pm ET. The Bank of Japan was partly in focus as it cut its 25-year Japanese government bonds (JGB) buys to 70 billion yen, compared to 80 billion yen in its last market operation.
The economic calendar was also in focus as Japan’s January industrial production fell 6.6% MoM compared to the 4.2% decrease forecasts. Retail sales for the month also missed estimates, down a seasonally adjusted 1.8% MoM versus forecasts for a decline of 0.6%.
The Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component indexes also retreated 0.8% and 0.2% respectively, as the country’s February manufacturing PMI expanded less than expected and came in at 50.3, compared to the estimate of 51.1. Non-manufacturing PMI stood at 54.4, also below the forecasted 55.0. Reports suggested that the long Lunar New Year break in mid-February may be to blame for the slowdown and expected output to improve in the coming months.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also traded 1.3% lower. The city’s annual financial budget is due later today.
The U.S. duties on Chinese aluminium foil gathered some attention as China expressed “strong dissatisfaction” with the decision.
""The U.S. has disregarded the WTO rules and seriously damaged the interests of China's aluminium foil exporters. China is strongly dissatisfied with this,"" Wang Hejun, the head of country’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM)'s Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau, said in a statement.

SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors' South Korean unit plans to slash the number of its executives, an internal letter seen by Reuters showed - the latest step by the U.S. automaker as it attempts a politically contentious restructuring of the loss-making business.
GM, which has some 16,000 employees in South Korea, also asked staff to ""actively consider"" a previously announced voluntary redundancy plan which has a Friday deadline, a separate letter showed.
The automaker this month shocked South Korea when it said it would shut one of its factories in the country and decide the fate of three remaining plants in the coming weeks.
The letters underscore the difficulties GM faces as it tries to wrangle concessions on wages from an angry labor union and win financial support from a South Korean government that is set to conduct due diligence on what it has called GM Korea's ""opaque"" management.
Although talks with unions have come much earlier than expected with union leaders under pressure to make concessions to prevent more factory closures, a union official told Reuters that initial discussions on Wednesday had not made any progress.
According to one of the letters sent to staff, GM Korea plans to cut the number of executives ranked managing director or more senior by 35 percent and reduce the number of directors and team leaders by 20 percent.
A GM Korea spokesman confirmed the plan, noting that the unit had around 150 executives and hundreds of team leaders.
""Changing our leadership structure is another of many initiatives to move forward the viability of the company,"" he said.
The unit also plans to shrink the number of so-called ""international service personnel"" executives, who have been dispatched from GM headquarters and other affiliates overseas, by 45 percent.
In particular, generous packages for the 36 such ex-pats which include support for housing, cars and payment of school fees for their children have come under fire from GM Korea's labor union.
The changes will start immediately and with all set to be in place by the third quarter of this year, the letter said, adding that a freeze was being put on executive promotions. 
In a separate letter, GM Korea stressed to employees that they only had until Friday to apply for the redundancy program and urged them to apply. It is offering South Korean workers three times their annual base salary, money for college tuition and more than $9,000 toward a new car as part of the redundancy proposal.
In talks with the union, GM is proposing a base wage freeze and no bonuses this year along with a suspension of some benefits such as the payment of university tuition for employees' children and gold medals for long-serving workers.
The talks on Wednesday ended after just a couple of hours, the union official said.
""Management is demanding unilateral sacrifice by the union, but the company should come up with a turnaround plan,"" he said, adding that demands by the union for executives' wages to be disclosed had been rejected. 
GM workers held another protest on Wednesday, holding signs calling for the withdrawal of the plant closure, before marching toward the presidential office. 
Overseas unions, including the United Auto Workers, also joined the protest. 
""The automotive sector will go through a major change in the next decade ... We support your struggle because it is our struggle,"" Georg Leutert, a director at Industrial Global Union, told the workers. 

""We are in solidarity with them,"" Darius D. Sivin, international representative at UAW, told Reuters, wearing a red hairband.

966,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>","Global stock bulls still running, but a bit more tired","By Rahul Karunakar
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global stock markets will rise further in 2018, even as the era of low inflation, bond yields and volatility has come to an end and the rocket fuel behind a bull run that began in 2009 is running dry, a Reuters polls of strategists showed.
After nearly a decade of easy monetary policy, the U.S. Federal Reserve is almost certain to raise rates three times this year. The Bank of Canada and the Bank of England will probably tighten too, while the European Central Bank is expected to end its stimulus program. [ECILT/US] [CA/POLL] [ECILT/GB][ECILT/EU]
Fears of a pickup in inflation and the expected surge in government borrowing to fund a gaping budget shortfall from the U.S. administration's tax cuts and new spending have pushed bond yields higher and that has reined in stocks a bit.
While world stock markets enjoyed a record 15-month winning streak in January on strong economic growth and solid company earnings, they plunged earlier this month as U.S. Treasury yields soared to a four-year high on fears interest rates will rise faster than expected.
Still, more than 200 equity strategists and brokers around the world polled by Reuters expect all but one of 17 indexes to build on the recent recovery from this month's sell-off and rise further through to the end of next year.
Equity bullishness is being tempered, however, by rising global bond yields and expectations for increased volatility.
About 80 percent of over 50 strategists who answered an extra question said the period of low inflation, bond yields and volatility is over.
""We do see inflation, bond yields and volatility all higher in 2018 than levels we were at in 2017. Better economic growth and more fiscal stimulus will put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates this year,"" noted Darrell Cronk, president at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
""We would find it difficult to imagine that we will return to the lows in volatility during the second half of 2017.""
Volatility spiked during the deep sell-off in equities and all but one of 82 specialists who answered a separate question said the CBOE Volatility index (VIX) this year will stay above its average of 11 percent over the past year.
Twenty-seven of 81 respondents said it will roughly average 10-15 percent, 44 said 15-20, eight said 20-25 and two said 25-30 percent.
A robust U.S. economic expansion that is expected to be supported by additional fiscal stimulus and higher profit growth will boost Wall Street, the poll found. The recent sell-off makes valuations look less stretched than in January.
The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) is forecast to end this year about 8.5 percent above 2017's finish and up 4.3 percent from Monday's close.
""Things are actually less expensive because of the powerful earnings (growth) and to a certain extent the market pulling back,"" said Jonathan Golub, Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist.
""We're in this nice place where things are moving forward but the risk that something goes wrong has been contained.""
Canada's main stock index is forecast to rise to a record high by the end of the year as the prospect of higher global inflation boosts the appeal for its resource shares, but a rising recession risk will help cap the index in 2019.
European shares were also expected to bounce back, according to strategists who also said the things that supported European markets in 2017 will continue to do so even if the market is now more volatile.
But concerns over the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union and rising volatility will hold back the FTSE share index from rising above its record high in the next two years.
Emerging economies' stock markets are expected to underperform developed ones as risks from huge fiscal deficits remain and on higher global interest rates.
Indian stocks are expected to recover most of their recent losses, helped by strong corporate earnings, but will close out 2018 a little short of the record high hit at the end of January.
Brazil's market rally is expected to head into a third year on strong growth expectations but the government's inability to plug a fiscal deficit could put a lid on those gains.
Russian stocks will end 2018 close to where they are now, shrugging off a presidential election but contemplating pressure from tepid economic growth and on any possible changes to Western sanctions against Russia.
When asked what will be substantially affected by any sharp moves in U.S. stocks, the top pick was emerging market shares.
""If the U.S. experiences sharp moves this year, everything will be affected,"" noted David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise. 
""How much and where will depend on what the dollar does. If the dollar rallies on a tighter Fed, EM will feel it the most.""

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped more than 1 percent, its biggest daily percentage drop since Feb.9 when world financial markets were battered by concerns U.S. inflation is picking up.
The index is now down nearly 5 percent in February.
Japan's Nikkei stumbled 1 percent on a slightly firmer yen.
China's blue-chip CSI300 skidded 0.6 percent while Shanghai's SSE (LON:SSE) Composite fell 0.8 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index declined more than 1 percent.
In an indication of the dour mood, S&P E- Mini futures slipped 0.1 percent while FTSE futures were off 0.6 percent. 
Asian markets had opened mildly lower but selling intensified after data showed growth in China's manufacturing sector in February slowed more than expected to the weakest in over 1-1/2 years.
Growth in China's services industry also slowed, suggesting the key sector was starting to display signs of fatigue.
The weakness was driven by disruption due to the Lunar New Year holidays and curbs to factory output from tougher pollution rules, but there are worries of a bigger loss in momentum.
Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China Economist at Capital Economics, said the ""the risk is still that the economy fares worse this year than is generally expected."" 
Some analysts cautioned the timing of the long holiday may have skewed the activity readings.
In Japan, the world's third-largest economy, industrial output in January took its biggest tumble since a devastating earthquake in March 2011, highlighting a weakening in demand and a build up of inventory.
Growth in India's factory activity slowed too in February.
Sentiment across financial markets was already sour after Fed's Jerome Powell gave an upbeat view of the U.S. economy on Tuesday and said recent data had strengthened his confidence on inflation.
When asked about likely catalysts for more than three rate hikes in 2018, he said each member would write a new ""dot plot"" rate path ahead of the March meeting and that he wouldn't want to prejudge that outcome. 
Rate futures fell following Powell's remarks as traders began pricing in about a one-in-three chance of a fourth hike this year.
Fears of faster U.S. rate hikes have caused anxiety that other central banks will start to tighten policy and raise borrowing costs. That would in turn hurt corporate earnings, clouding the outlook for what had been expected to be another solid year of global economic growth.
""Today's comments appear to open the door for others on the (Fed) Committee to revise their forecast as they see fit, and that Powell himself may be inclined to look for four hikes this year,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economist Michael Feroli said in a note. 
The Fed moved three times in 2017 and is seen as certain to do the same or more this year, with the first move expected as early as March. 
CURRENCIES
The dollar held on to gains after rallying against most major currencies on Tuesday. 
It hovered near a recent 1-1/2 month top against the Australian dollar and held near a three-week high on the euro at $1.2221.
However, it did not fare well against the Japanese yen, a perceived safe haven. The dollar was last down 0.2 percent at 107.10 yen.
Dollar bulls were wrongfooted after the Bank of Japan announced it would trim the amount of super long Japanese government bonds it offered to purchase at its regular debt-buying operation. 
Analysts are predicting a stronger yen this year despite faster U.S. rate rises, although speculators and Japanese retail investors have built huge short positions in yen futures setting the scene for a massive shakeout. 
In commodities, oil prices extended declines on weak output data from China and Japan and as an industry data showed an increase in U.S. crude stockpiles. 
Brent crude futures fell 40 cents to $66.23 a barrel, while U.S. crude was last down 33 cents at $62.68.
Spot gold eased to $1,317.61 an ounce, not far from Tuesday's $1,313.26 which was the lowest in three weeks.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 28, 2018 01:25AM ET</span>",Japan stocks to claw back to near 26-year high; strong yen bites: Reuters poll,"By Ayai Tomisawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese stocks are expected to claw their way back close to a 26-year high by end-December, up over 5 percent in 2018, but could be held back by likely prospects of a stronger yen, a Reuters poll of market strategists and fund managers found on Wednesday.
Respondents in the latest Reuters poll were mostly optimistic about further gains into this year and next, also based on a buoyant outlook for the global economy as well as the longest run of domestic growth in nearly 30 years.
However, the gains will likely be limited as companies are expected to forecast weaker profits for the next year due to a stronger yen.
The Nikkei share average (N225) is expected to trade at 24,000 at year-end, up over 7 percent from Tuesday's close of 22,389.86, according to the median forecast from 19 analysts and fund managers polled by Reuters in the past week.
The Nikkei is down around 8 percent from its 26-year high hit on Jan. 23. That followed a Wall Street rout, based in part on inflation worries that have boosted yields on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note (US10YT=RR) to a four-year high.
But the Nikkei has regained momentum along with U.S. stocks.
""We know that high volatility and high yields do not mean an economic slowdown,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, a senior fund manager at Dalton Capital Japan, one of the more bullish respondents in the poll, forecasting the Nikkei to reach 25,000 at year-end. 
He added that growth and low-volatility stocks, which have outperformed the broader market in the past, will likely make a turnaround. He said value shares like banks and exporters are likely to be bid up from now on. 
For its part, the U.S. Federal Reserve, looking past the recent stock market sell-off and inflation concerns, expects economic growth to remain steady and sees no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes.
""From now to June, we expect U.S. companies to post strong profits thanks to a big tax cut, and shares will likely be strong on the prospect that U.S. rate hikes won't be (delivered) more than three times"" this year, said Akio Yoshino, chief economist at Amundi Japan.
Forecasts for end-2018 ranged from 20,000 to 28,000. They were 22,000 to 25,000 for mid-2018. In the previous poll conducted in October, forecasts were 16,500 to 23,000 for mid-2018, and 14,500-26,000 for end-December 2018.
STRONGER YEN BITES
A recent Reuters poll showed most analysts predict the Bank of Japan will keep a key part of its super-easy monetary policy -- the long-term bond yield target -- at zero percent throughout the year, despite strength in Japan's economy.
Japanese yields would normally move upwards as well, but the BOJ stops that from happening, leading to a widening gap between the United States and Japan.
The interest rate difference created greater downward pressure on the yen last year, but analysts say that is over and it will be the dollar instead that will be nudged downward.
""The U.S.'s twin deficits are to blame,"" said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities, referring to the United States' huge and growing budget deficit, as well as the current account deficit.
In a separate Reuters poll, more than half the economists said 110-114 yen to the dollar was the optimal exchange rate for Japan's export-dependent economy. Recently, the yen has strengthened sharply to around 105.50 yen, hurting exporters' profits.
Fujito said that with the dollar trading at around 106 yen  now, by the time companies release their forecasts in late April-May, their own foreign exchange assumptions may range around 100-105 yen.
""Earnings for the next fiscal year will likely be break-even or they may just eke out small gains on the year,"" Fujito said.
Analysts also said volatility still remains a focus point in U.S. shares. Asked about which asset classes would be the most vulnerable if U.S. stocks move sharply, answers ranged from emerging-market shares and bonds, developed market stocks and currencies as well as high-yielding products.
""We've seen that Japanese stocks which have high liquidity got hit a lot as well as the yen in the wake of U.S. stock market's rout,"" said Takashi Ito, an equity market strategist at Nomura Securities.

Output stood at 147,481 cars last month, down 0.05 percent, as a 1.5 percent increase in sales abroad compensated for a 6 percent drop in demand at home, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
Carmakers are concerned however that their vehicles could face tariffs or lengthy customs checks when entering the EU after a transition period following Brexit, putting at risk sales to the sector's biggest foreign market.
""While it is good to see global appetite for British-built cars reach record levels in January, this only reinforces the industry’s increasing reliance on overseas demand,"" said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes. 

""Future growth will therefore depend on maintaining our current open trade links not just with Europe but with key international markets.""

970,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 06:30PM ET</span>","Morgan Stanley revises earnings, boosts compensation after U.S. tax change","By Catherine Ngai
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The new U.S. tax law has taken a bigger bite out of Morgan Stanley's 2017 earnings than it initially expected and led its board to boost top executives' deferred compensation from prior years, the Wall Street bank said on Tuesday.
After further analysis of the law's particulars,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) boosted its provision for income taxes by $43 million, the bank said in its annual 10-K securities filing. The adjustment reduced earnings per share from continuing operations by 3 cents per share in the fourth quarter and 2 cents per share for the full year.
The sweeping tax code changes enacted in late December cuts the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, meaning that U.S.-based corporations with the highest rates like banks would benefit in the longer term.
Morgan Stanley expects its overall tax rate from continuing operations this year to be 22 to 25 percent, depending on where its earnings come from globally.
The bank's board also decided to change the amount of long-term stock awards executives were awarded in prior years because of the way tax code changes affected the performance targets they had to hit. 

Although the new law is expected to boost future corporate earnings, big Wall Street banks took large one-time earnings hits last year related to deferred tax assets and earnings stored overseas.

(Reuters) - Several state officials on Tuesday offered Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) a new place to call home after a Georgia legislator said he would kill lucrative tax benefits to the Atlanta-based carrier as retribution for its decision to sever ties with the National Rifle Association.
Officials from Virginia, Washington, New York and Ohio have volunteered their states to headquarter Delta after the No. 2 U.S. carrier faced some public outcry for ending its relationship with the NRA in the wake of the recent Florida school shooting. 
""Any state would be lucky to call itself the home of Delta headquarters,"" Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan, a Democrat, wrote in an open letter to Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian. 
""Hey @Delta—Virginia is for lovers and airline hubs. You're welcome here any time,"" Virginia Governor, Democrat Ralph Northam, wrote on Twitter to his 125,000 followers. 
Delta did not respond to requests for comment. 
On Monday, Georgia Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, a Republican, wrote on Twitter he would ""kill any tax legislation"" that benefits Delta, unless the carrier reinstated its relationship with the NRA, which advocates for the Second Amendment right for Americans to bear arms. [nL2N1QG1RM]
""Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,"" Cagle wrote.
Delta is one of Georgia's largest private employers with 33,000 employees statewide. 
The Georgia legislator is considering a jet fuel sales tax exemption designed to benefit Delta that would save the airline some $40 million per year. 
Cagle is running for governor in the 2018 race, and rival Republicans in the race have said they will not support the measure unless Delta reinstates its relationship with the NRA.
The NRA has been under renewed fire since the Feb. 14 massacre of 17 students and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, by a gunman with a legally purchased semiautomatic rifle reignited the nation's long-running debate over gun rights. [nL2N1QG18N]
More than a dozen corporations have cut ties with the NRA since last week, including rival United Airlines, car rental companies Enterprise Rent-A-Car and Alamo Rent a Car, MetLife (NYSE:MET) insurance and others. [nL4N1QG3WY]
Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo and the Lieutenant Governor Cyrus Habib of Washington also extended welcomes to Delta to relocate to their respective states. 
""While Georgia politicians may disagree with the airline's principled stand, we here in the Empire State welcome Delta with open arms, and invite them to move their headquarters here,"" Cuomo said in a Tuesday statement.
The NRA did not comment.

972,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 08:12PM ET</span>",A question of interest at the heart of debate over GM Korea rescue,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - For years, General Motors (NYSE:GM) resisted calls from South Korean officials to cut interest rates it was charging on nearly $3 billion in loans to its loss-making South Korean unit, according to three sources and documents seen by Reuters.
The U.S. automaker, which has announced plans to close one GM Korea plant, last week proposed swapping its debt for equity in exchange for financial support from the South Korean government to keep operating in the country.
But the interest charges remain a bugbear for Seoul, which wants an audit of what it calls GM Korea's ""opaque"" management before deciding whether to spend taxpayers' money to help the unit.
South Korean officials and politicians blame GM's high interest rates for exacerbating losses at GM Korea, which was already struggling with slumping exports to Europe.
""Board members asked for interest rate cuts at almost every meeting, but GM turned a deaf ear,"" a GM Korea board member told Reuters.
""From a South Korean perspective, it is not right for the biggest shareholder to receive such a high interest rate when lending money to its affiliate,"" said the board member, who declined to be named citing the confidentiality of the matter.
The U.S. parent company told the board it had to apply equal rates to loans extended to its affiliates and couldn't give GM Korea ""preferential treatment"", the board member said. 
A spokesman for GM in Detroit said the company does not disclose specific details of its internal financial practices.
DEBT DEBATE 
GM has lent its South Korean unit nearly 3 trillion won ($2.79 billion), charging interest of 4.8 to 5.3 percent per annum, GM Korea's latest regulatory filing shows.
That has riled some lawmakers who are now being asked to step in and help save GM Korea, and who say other automakers are paying much less in interest.
South Korea's Hyundai Motor borrowed money at interest rates of 1.49 percent to 2.26 percent, and Ssangyong Motor, a smaller player than GM Korea, paid 3.51 percent, lawmaker Ji Sang-wuk said, citing regulatory filings.
Over the past four years, GM Korea has paid GM 500 billion won in interest, according to GM Korea’s filings. The South Korean unit has racked up a total of 1.9 trillion won in net losses in the three years from 2014 to 2016.
Some of the loans stem from 2012 and 2013, when GM Korea borrowed the funds to buy back $1.2 billion in preferred stock from former creditor and now No.2 shareholder, state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB), officials at GM Korea and KDB said. 
""This has made GM Korea bear the financial burden from its borrowings from GM Headquarters, which was able to take interest,"" a former KDB executive involved in the matter told Reuters. He requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The buyback was made ahead of a 2017 deadline to reduce rising dividend obligations on the preferred stock, cutting GM Korea's costs.
""We made an early redemption to improve our financial structure and reduce our payments burden,"" a GM Korea official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, told Reuters. ""Local banks were reluctant to lend money because of our weak financial position."" 
BLAME GAME
A former GM Korea board member with direct knowledge of the matter said GM Korea's board had asked KDB for loans with lower interest repayments but KDB also refused to lend to the loss making firm.
""GM couldn’t let GM Korea go bankrupt so it lent money with the same level interest rate that it charged other GM affiliates,"" the source said. 
""If this is going to be a blame game over GM taking high interest, this won’t help find a solution,"" he added. 
KDB declined to comment.
In December, KDB's chairman delivered a letter to the head of GM Korea, demanding GM cut interest rates to help improve profits, according to a document seen by Reuters. 
KDB had asked to review GM Korea's financial status but had been rejected by GM, a current KDB official said.
""We asked GM to find a real cause for the losses but they rejected our proposal twice for due diligence on GM Korea,"" the official said, who also requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
""Also since 2016 we keep asking GM to lower the interest rate for its loans to GM Korea, but it is not happening.""

973,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank to pay $240 million to end Libor rigging lawsuit in U.S.,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) has agreed to pay $240 million to settle private U.S. antitrust litigation accusing it of conspiring with other banks to manipulate the Libor benchmark interest rate.
The preliminary settlement with the German bank was disclosed in filings on Tuesday with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, and requires a judge's approval.
Deutsche Bank is the third bank to resolve claims by so-called ""over-the-counter"" investors that transacted directly with banks on a panel to determine Libor.
 Citigroup  Inc (N:C) reached a similar $130 million settlement last July, while the British bank  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC) settled for $120 million in November 2015. [nL1N1KT1LU]
Deutsche Bank denied wrongdoing, but settled to avoid the risks, costs and distraction of litigation, court papers show.
A spokesman, Troy Gravitt, said the bank was pleased to settle.
Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, is used by banks to set rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of credit card, mortgage, student loan and other transactions, and to determine the cost of borrowing from each other.
Investors including the city of Baltimore and Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut had accused 16 banks of conspiring to manipulate Libor, in the private litigation that began in 2011.
Michael Hausfeld, a lawyer for the investors, in a statement called the Deutsche Bank settlement ""an excellent achievement for the class.""
Banks have paid roughly $9 billion to settle Libor-rigging probes worldwide. Last July, the head of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said that regulator will phase out Libor by the end of 2021, citing a lack of data to underpin it.

The case is In re: Libor-Based Financial Instruments Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-md-02262.

Their last exclusive, 10-year cross-promotional deal was reportedly worth $1 billion to Disney, according to the Los Angeles Times. McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) paid $100 million in royalties and conducted 11 promotions a year for Disney movies and television shows and opened restaurants inside its theme parks, the Times reported.
The new multi-year, non-exclusive agreement will begin in June with promotions, including Disney movie-themed Happy Meal toys, for ""Incredibles 2,"" followed in the autumn by ""Ralph Breaks the Internet: Wreck-It Ralph 2.""
Executives from both companies declined to disclose the duration or value of the new deal. 
A McDonald's spokeswoman said the new pact does not include any agreement on restaurants in parks but added: ""We will continue to explore ways to bring this alliance to life.""
Disney introduced voluntary guidelines in 2006 that prohibited licensing of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters for foods that fail to meet minimum nutrition requirements. 
That same year, an Institute of Medicine report said junk food marketing contributed to childhood obesity.
McDonald's since 2006 has taken numerous steps to make Happy Meals more nutritious and less fattening. Changes included adding fruit side options, cutting french fry portions and using menus to encourage consumers to order water rather than sugary soda.
In June 2018, all Happy Meals offered on McDonald's U.S. menu boards in the United States will contain 600 calories or less, 10 percent of calories from saturated fat and 10 percent of calories from added sugar. More than three-quarters will have 650 mg of sodium or less.

Consultants and franchisees say Happy Meals account for roughly 15 percent of McDonald's U.S. sales. The company does not break out product sales, but said family trips represent 30 percent of all visits to McDonald's around the world.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Jame Donath plans to shutter his Magnolia Road Capital, the latest casualty in the $3 trillion hedge fund industry where many small firms are struggling to attract and retain capital, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Donath told clients he is liquidating his 5-year-old, New York-based firm which specializes in distressed debt investing. The bulk of capital will be returned by the end of the year, Donath wrote in a Feb. 26 letter.
The decision, Donath wrote, was not sparked by poor returns. Rather ""our fund has had difficulty raising additional capital with which to scale our business."" 
Donath declined to comment.
Magnolia started trading with roughly $45 million in capital in 2013 and more than doubled its assets to roughly $100 million now. Still, that is not enough to take advantage of future trading opportunities, Donath wrote.
Magnolia's demise illustrates a trend where more hedge funds closed than opened in the first three quarters of 2017. Late last year distressed investor Archview Investment Group said it was shutting down and Bowery Investment Management is also shutting down.
Investors are more nervous about committing to smaller firms even though these are often said to be more nimble traders and able to score the big returns that made hedge funds famous.
At the same time, there is little appetite for distressed debt investing with assets standing at $198 billion last year, only slightly more than $183.6 billion in 2016, data from Hedge Fund Research show. The industry's biggest distressed debt players include Marc Lasry's Avenue Capital Group and Jamie Dinan's York Capital Management. 
""There are fewer sources of capital for new and emerging managers,"" said Putri Pascualy, a managing director at PAAMCO, which invests with hedge funds. ""And even managers with a strong pedigree and a long track record are having a difficult time raising money,"" she added.
Donath had the pedigree investors want to see, with degrees from Yale and Harvard Business School. He also was a portfolio manager at hedge fund Karsch Capital Management and a managing director at Davidson Kempner Capital Management.
And his returns were solid with investors saying the fund gained 1.8 percent in January when the HFRI benchmark Distressed/Restructuring Index rose 1.3 percent. In 2016 the fund gained 14.2 percent and the index climbed 15.5 percent. In 2017, it returned 5.5 percent when the HFRI index climbed 6.64 percent. 
But less than half of the 250 institutional investors surveyed for JP Morgan's Capital Advisory Group 2018 Institutional Investor Survey said that distressed credit investments were interesting to them now. By contrast, long/short equity and event-driven funds topped their wish list.
Also pension funds, a favorite investor for many hedge fund managers, said they would not invest with a firm that has less than $250 million in assets, the survey showed.

1. US GDP, Housing Data To Help Markets Rebound?
As markets enter the final day of month, investors remain hopeful that a duo of reports on housing and economic growth will restore positive sentiment on riskier assets after US stocks slumped as Fed chair Jerome Powell’s upbeat comments raised the prospect of a fourth rate hike.
The penultimate reading of fourth-quarter US GDP is expected to show the rate of  economic growth slowed to 2.5%, down from the previous reading of 2.6%.
Pending Home Sales, meanwhile, is forecast to show 0.3% growth for January following a 0.5% rise in the prior month. The supply crisis is expected to continue to weigh on housing as listings struggle to keep up with strong demand driven by wage growth and the prospect of higher mortgage rates.
The dollar traded sharply higher against its rivals on Tuesday, as the greenback enjoyed renewed demand thanks to growing expectations for four rate hikes in 2018.
2. Crude Supplies To Post Surprise Draw, Again? 
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles rose last week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 2.07 million barrels in the week ended Feb 23. Yet, last week crude supplies unexpectedly fell despite expectations for a build as the price difference between Brent and crude widened fuelling foreign demand buying of US crude which helped slash stockpiles.

3. Eurozone Inflation in Focus
The Eurozone releases its preliminary consumer price index (CPI) reading for February on Wednesday. A stronger-than-expected CPI print could pressure the European Central Bank to consider the prospect of reining in accommodative monetary policy.
The first step of which could be a wind down of bond purchases, according to Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann. The Bundesbank president said Tuesday there is “no reason why the Governing Council should not end the net purchases of securities this year,” should economic growth and inflation continue to rise.
Economists forecast Eurozone inflation of 1.2% annual rate through February compared to 1.3% in the prior month. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is expected to remained unchanged at an annual rate of 1%.
Inflation has lagged the European Central Bank’s target of below, but close to, 2%.

985,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 03:30PM ET</span>",Here's What We Learned From Powell's First Fed Chair Testimony,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell appeared Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, his first testimony since he took charge earlier this month. He moved markets with his upbeat economic assessment, and also dropped some hints about how his views and style might differ from his predecessor, Janet Yellen.
Here are a some observations beneath the main headlines:
A Personal Touch
When a Fed chief testifies before Congress, he or she is generally understood to be speaking for the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Powell, however, on several occasions voiced strong personal views. That perhaps injects a new dynamic into the Fed’s communication that’s different from the Yellen era: a Fed leader whose own inclinations are much better known publicly.
Personalizing was apparent in several of Powell’s responses during the three-hour hearing. Since the Fed last released economic projections, Congress has rolled out two changes that could boost near-term growth. A $1.5 trillion tax package is adding stimulus to the U.S. economy, and a recent budget deal will lift spending caps and increase government outlays.
“I think our view -- my personal view -- would be that there will be a meaningful increment to demand, at least for the next couple of years, from the combination of those two things,” he said.
Powell’s voice also came through in his answer to a question about whether the new stimulus will spur more 2018 rate hikes than the three the Fed signaled in the central bank’s Summary of Economic Projections in December.
“My personal outlook for the economy has strengthened since December,” he said. “I wouldn’t want to prejudge that new set of projections, but we’ll be taking into account everything that has happened since December.”
Why does it matter that Powell isn’t shy about expressing his own views? The chairman is seen as the center of the committee, so his optimism may stoke expectations that the whole group will fall in line and pursue a slightly more aggressive tightening path.
Market Mover
Powell’s debut riled markets, sending stocks lower while pushing Treasury yields higher as investors bet that rates would rise more quickly. Fortunately, the new Fed chairman told lawmakers that market moves aren’t at the center of his dashboard, so he’s unlikely to be phased by any near-term gyrations. The stock market is an important place for businesses to raise capital and it enters the Fed’s thinking, but it’s not the economy, he said.
Fiscal Fallout
While Powell nodded to the growth-enhancing benefits of fiscal policy reform, he was less welcoming of longer-term strain on the nation’s budget. The nation’s debt is unsustainable, he said, but he’s not sounding the alarm yet.
“There would come a time at which -- it’s not this time, not this time by a long shot -- but there could come a time when the public, the global debt-buying public, would come to the view that we either weren’t prepared to honor our debts or that we couldn’t service them,” Powell said. “We’re a long way from that.”
Wage Outlook
Powell widened our understanding of how he thinks about wages: While he sees them moving higher, “for wages to go up sustainably, you need higher productivity,” he said.
That’s important because if Powell thought that wage weakness was the result of lingering job market slack, the Fed would be able to counteract it. Given his stance, it’s an issue for Congress and President Donald Trump to tackle, and not one Fed policy can readily address.
Balance Sheet 
The Fed’s balance sheet made an appearance in Powell’s congressional show. Policy makers are unwinding their holdings, swollen after three rounds of crisis-era asset purchases, and Powell got peppered with questions about that process. He reiterated the Fed’s line that officials ultimately want the balance sheet to be no larger than necessary to conduct effective monetary policy and that it will consist mainly of Treasuries at the end of the day.
“Our balance sheet normalization plan was carefully crafted and carefully rolled out,"" Powell said. “I would have little inclination to change the general parameters of it.” 
Three’s Not a Crowd
The Fed Board is pretty short staffed right now -- just three of seven governor seats are filled. Powell isn’t asking for four new colleagues immediately, he told Congress, but it sure would be nice if he, Lael Brainard and Randal Quarles weren’t holding down the Eccles Building by themselves. 
“We could really use some more faces on the hall,” Powell said. “We’re all three eager to have more people on board.”
There is one Fed governor nominee, Carnegie Mellon economist Marvin Goodfriend, who’s awaiting Senate confirmation. Given our latest report, approval isn’t a slam dunk.

987,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court bankruptcy ruling reignites $8 billion Tribune case,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday trimmed a key legal defense that has frustrated creditors who try to claw back potentially dubious payments made before a corporate bankruptcy in a ruling that will reignite litigation over the 2007 buyout of Tribune Co.
At issue is a federal bankruptcy provision, called the safe harbor, that prevents certain securities transactions, including payments to shareholders, from being unwound by representatives of a bankrupt company's estate.
Creditor attorneys have increasingly complained that bankrupt companies structure payments to take advantage of the safe harbor, which U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi called a ""too good to be true"" defense in 2014 testimony to Congress.
In a unanimous decision, the high court ruled that safe harbor did not protect payments if financial institutions were merely conduits, reversing the law in the key bankruptcy courts in Delaware and New York. 
""The safe harbor defense was getting raised all over the place,"" said Edward Weisfelner, a bankruptcy lawyer with Brown Rudnick who represents creditors. ""For those of us on the plaintiffs side ... it's about time."" 
In the case before the Supreme Court, racetrack operator Valley View Downs LP borrowed $55 million to buy all the shares of Bedford Downs Management Corp.
Valley View filed for bankruptcy protection soon after, and its trustee sought to claw back the funds paid to Bedford shareholders, arguing that Valley View was insolvent at the time of the deal.
The Supreme Court rejected the argument of Merit Management Group LP, one of the shareholders, that the payments were protected by the safe harbor. The court found that the banks that handled the funds were conduits. 
The ruling will have an immediate effect on the long-running litigation stemming from the leveraged buyout of the Tribune media company in 2007, a deal that was led by real estate mogul Sam Zell. 
Less than a year after the deal closed, Tribune filed for bankruptcy, saddled with unsustainable debt taken on to buy out shareholders.
A litigation trustee has been trying to claw back some of the $8 billion in payments to Tribune's 5,500 shareholders, and made a settlement offer in January that will now be withdrawn in the wake of Tuesday's ruling. 
""I am gratified that the Supreme Court corrected the mistaken view of the law,"" said Marc Kirschner, the Tribune litigation trustee.
The Tribune settlement varied, depending on the amount of stock sold into the two-step buyout. For example, shareholders who sold between $1 million and $10 million in stock could have settled for 27.5 percent of the payments received in step one and for 55 percent received in step two.
Some of the largest shareholders included the Chandler Trusts and the McCormick (NYSE:MKC) Foundation, according to court records.

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials met with auto industry executives in Washington on Tuesday, three sources said, as talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement try to make progress on a major sticking point around vehicle production.
The U.S. negotiator handling 'rules of origin' for automobiles, Jason Bernstein, unexpectedly returned to Washington for consultations soon after the seventh round of NAFTA talks between the United States, Mexico and Canada began in Mexico City on Sunday.
Three people familiar with the matter said representatives from the office of U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer would hold separate meetings with executives from Ford and General Motors (NYSE:GM) on Tuesday afternoon. 
USTR declined to comment.
Ford said in a statement it had an ongoing dialogue about the importance of NAFTA with the government, with an emphasis on enforceable rules prohibiting currency manipulation.
A GM spokesman said: ""These regular meetings with USTR happen in the context of any major trade agreement to assure that GM's point of view is heard.""
The GM meeting lasted less than an hour and was a routine meeting that did not discuss any major breakthroughs or policy changes, according to one of the sources, who was briefed on the meetings.
Time is running out to agree a new NAFTA before a Mexican presidential vote and U.S. mid-term congressional elections later this year. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has put forward an aggressive set of proposals that are complicating progress.
Among those proposals is a demand that seeks to guarantee that the United States gets more of the world's auto business by ensuring that more of the finished product is produced in North America.
Officials have said they do not expect a major breakthrough on the auto issue during the current round of talks, though some in attendance were encouraged by the signs of greater U.S. discussion of rules of origin - even if that part of the round is now on hold while Bernstein is in Washington.
Kenneth Smith, Mexico's chief NAFTA negotiator, said he hoped Bernstein would quickly return to Mexico City, where rules of origin discussions were meant to last from Sunday to Tuesday.
""Hopefully these consultations are positive,"" Smith told reporters, referring to the industry talks in Washington.
Smith said there had been ""a lot of progress"" on other NAFTA chapters involving telecommunications, digital commerce, technical barriers to trade and regulatory practices.
DEFICIT FIX
Mexico's economy minister had said the country could put forward its own automotive proposal at the round, but he is facing resistance from the industry to give any ground.
Eduardo Solis, the head of Mexico's automotive industry association (AMIA), told reporters at the talks there was no fresh Mexican proposal and reiterated his longstanding position that the rules of origin in the original NAFTA be maintained.
""All there is is the original U.S. proposal, which we've said is totally unacceptable,"" Solis said.
Under NAFTA, 62.5 percent of the net cost of a passenger car or light truck must originate in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs. Trump wants the threshold raised to 85 percent and is also seeking to ensure half the total content is from the United States.
The demand reflects Trump's belief that trade with Mexico and Canada is hurting U.S. jobs and factories.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to pull out of NAFTA unless the deal can be reworked in a way that favors the United States.
The U.S. president said in Washington on Monday that his country was probably losing ""$130 billion a year"" to Mexico.
""For years, I've been saying ... (it is) $71 billion, but it's really not,"" Trump said, adding that the United States also loses ""a lot"" with Canada. ""People don't know it. Canada is very smooth. They have you believe that it's wonderful. And it is — for them. Not wonderful for us,"" he added.
U.S. data show the country's 2017 trade deficit in goods with Mexico was $71.1 billion and $17.6 billion with Canada.
Critics of Trump's stance say the deficit reflects robust U.S. consumption, not unfair trade.
It was unclear how Tuesday's U.S. automotive discussions might affect the debate on rules of origin, but the people briefed on the matter did not expect a major change in position.
If USTR was going to announce a radical shift on the rules, the auto companies believe the meetings would be held at CEO level, according to two of the people familiar with the matter.
Solis said automakers were still evaluating ideas put forward by Canada to include newer technology in the calculation of a vehicle's value, and that innovations such as hybrid and electric cars could end up with different rules because they were not contemplated in the initial accord.

The auto industry has opposed Trump's demands on increased content, arguing it will disrupt supply chains and raise costs. Mexican officials say the issue must largely be resolved between the White House and U.S.-based industry bosses.

998,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>","JPMorgan Expects New Profit Record With Help From Trump, the Fed","(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). is the most profitable bank in U.S. history. It expects to keep that title with help from the Fed and Donald Trump.
Higher U.S. interest rates engineered by the Federal Reserve and lower corporate taxes spearheaded by the Trump administration translate into about $7 billion more in pretax profit in coming years, JPMorgan said Tuesday in a presentation. Annual earnings may jump by a third from last year’s high point, based on the lender’s forecasts.
The gains give Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon room to plow money into technology investments, 400 new branches and a massive new corporate headquarters on Park Avenue. It also bolsters Dimon’s years-long contention that the bank could accelerate profits once it got more help from monetary policy and politicians.
“Management continues to play the long game and build even bigger competitive moats around each of its businesses,” Glenn Schorr, an Evercore Inc. bank analyst, wrote in a note to investors. The firm is making “investments that some smaller and/or less profitable peers can’t fully do.”
The bank’s two sources of revenue -- net interest income and non-interest fees -- may both jump to about $55 billion in 2018, the company said. JPMorgan boosted its outlook for medium-term pretax income to as much as $47 billion from about $40 billion in 2017, and said the U.S. tax overhaul will boost return on tangible common equity up to 3 percentage points.
The more optimistic outlook “appears reasonably consistent with our forecast and entirely consistent with a franchise focused on investment and well positioned for profitable growth,”  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG analysts led by Susan Roth Katzke said in a note.
The bank’s forecasts equate to annual net income of $33 billion to $36 billion, according to Jefferies LLC analyst Ken Usdin. That’s up significantly from the $27 billion the bank produced over the 12 months ended in September.
The shares fell 0.2 percent to $118.50 at 12:43 p.m. in New York.
Along with rising interest rates, JPMorgan expects a large windfall from the Republican tax overhaul passed last year. While the bank said last month it would boost wages for some workers and expand branches in response to the tax cuts, much of the benefit will fall to shareholders through higher profits.
The changes appear to benefit the asset-management division the most, with the bank forecasting return on equity in that business of about 35 percent, up from 25 percent. Consumer banking ROE will jump to more than 25 percent from about 20 percent, according to the presentation.
Favorable Trends
More intense competition will mean some of the tax benefit will flow to customers as well, the bank said.
“While relatively strong, we view its medium-term targets as generally in-line with expectations,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc analysts led by Jason Goldberg wrote in a note to investors.
Non-interest expenses will rise to less than $62 billion in 2018 from $58.5 billion this year as the company increases spending on investments such as technology, which will get about $1.4 billion more, according to the forecast. The figure compared with the $61 billion projected by analysts at Credit Suisse.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Some of the largest U.S. asset managers profiting directly from gunmakers' retirement plans are siding with the investment needs of workers while they review ways to address the sort of gun violence that left 17 dead at a Florida high school. 
As a growing list of U.S. companies say they will snub the gun manufacturing industry or cut ties to the National Rifle Association (NRA), many of the leading money managers are maintaining an agnostic approach in their relationship with companies such as Sturm Ruger & Company Inc (N:RGR) and American Outdoor Brands Corp (O:AOBC), maker of Smith & Wesson handguns and rifles. 
The national conversation about guns and their place in American society has reached a fevered pitch in the wake of the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
American Funds, JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc (N:JPM), MassMutual and T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW) are among the top managers of about $1.5 billion in retirement plan assets at the largest U.S. gun and ammunition makers, according to Department of Labor disclosures. All of the companies declined to comment for this story.

They earn fees for managing the money deposited into their mutual funds offered in 401(k) retirement accounts for gun industry workers. Employers typically match a portion of workers' contributions. 
Vanguard Group, the largest U.S. mutual fund company, said it is interested only in meeting the needs of plan participants by choosing strategies that give them the best chance for investment success. 
""Sector or company type does not enter into this assessment,"" Vanguard spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann said. 
John Hancock, which manages money in the 401(k) plan for handgun maker Glock Inc, said it has an obligation to serve the needs of workers. 
“We are reviewing ways that our company, and companies like ours, can help address the issue of gun violence in the United States,” John Hancock spokeswoman Beth McGoldrick said. 
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS 
To be sure, the amount of assets in the largest firearms retirement plans are a rounding error to a mutual fund industry that manages about $17 trillion in assets. Three Vanguard funds offered in the 401(k) plan for Smith & Wesson workers, for example, managed about $16.2 million assets, according to the plan's latest annual report. Management fees for Vanguard on that account would be less than $100,000 a year. 
On a similar scale, BlackRock Inc's (N:BLK) Equity Dividend I Fund manages about 5 percent of the $68 million in assets in the NRA's 401(k) plan. But BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is one of a handful of big investors that has said publicly it will talk to gunmakers “to understand their response” to the deadly shooting on Valentine's Day.
U.S. asset manager  State Street  Corp (N:STT) also said it plans to seek details from gunmakers on how they will support the “safe and responsible use of their products,” adding to pressure on the industry. 
Funds managed by T. Rowe Price are the largest holdings in an  Olin Corp  (N:OLN) retirement plan with about $690 million in assets, according to the latest Department of Labor disclosure. Olin makes Winchester ammunition and specialty chemicals.
Joe Keefe, president of Impax Asset Management, which runs funds focused on socially responsible investing, said he does not think it is likely any of his firms would end up in the 401(k) plan of a firearms company.
""I think they would be unlikely to include funds in their 401(k) line-up that expressly forbid investing in weapons manufacturers,"" Keefe said.
But the 401(k) plan for Glock offers such a fund. The Domini Impact Equity Fund, which has screened out gun stocks for more than two decades, is one of many investment options in the retirement plan for Glock workers. The fund managed about $34,000 of the Glock plan’s $7.8 million in assets, according to the latest Department of Labor report. 
How the Domini fund became an investment option is not known. Glock did not return messages seeking comment. 
""I guess there is someone at Glock who prefers to invest in funds that wouldn't buy a gun manufacturer,"" said Amy Domini, a founder of the Domini Impact Funds. ""I'm a big believer that individuals should have choice.""

1008,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 01:24PM ET</span>",PayPal settles U.S. charges over alleged Venmo disclosure failure: FTC,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL), parent of peer-to-peer payments app Venmo, has settled U.S. charges it failed to give critical disclosures to users regarding privacy and the availability of funds transferred into a Venmo account, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday.
The FTC said in a statement that the alleged actions violated federal law aimed at protecting consumer information and that as part of the proposed settlement Venmo must submit to third-party reviews of its compliance with privacy rules for 10 years, among other actions.
PayPal was not required to pay any money as part of the settlement. 
The FTC said that Venmo would sometimes notify users that deposits had been made to their Venmo accounts and could be transferred to their banks. But, at times, when users tried to make that transfer, Venmo either froze the account and sometimes reversed the payment.
This meant that some users were unable to pay bills and suffered financial hardship, the FTC said.
The agency also alleged that Venmo at times misrepresented what actions were needed to keep transactions private, resulting in disclosures that users did not want, the FTC said.
PayPal head of corporate communications Amanda Miller said the alleged problems occurred before PayPal bought Venmo in 2013.

""We are pleased to conclude this process with the FTC in a cooperative way,"" Miller said in a statement. ""As a core part of PayPal's and Venmo's business and operations, we’ve taken steps to significantly strengthen our privacy and data security practices.""

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",Brazil president weighing Boeing-Embraer joint venture: spokesman,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's President Michel Temer is weighing whether to support a proposal for a joint commercial aviation company between  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer (SA:EMBR3), a presidential spokesman said on Tuesday.
The Brazilian government has opposed an outright takeover of Embraer by Boeing and a new proposal involves creating a third company that includes Embraer's passenger plane unit, the world's top maker of regional jets, while excluding its defense unit. Temer must ultimately approve any deal. 
""Nothing has been decided on the partnership between the two companies,"" Temer's top spokesman Marcio de Freitas told Reuters. 
""The Defense Ministry received the proposal and sent it to the president, but it still has to be studied and there are still some doubts about the matter,"" he added, without providing further details. 
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said this month the company has been working on a deal for years, but added it was not essential. Boeing spokesman Phil Musser reaffirmed that stance in an email on Tuesday, calling a combination with Embraer ""a win-win for all."" 
Embraer, the world's third-largest planemaker, said in a securities filing that no details of the talks have been set in stone, which was echoed by Temer's office. 
Questions remain about each company's stake, however.
Brazilian business newspaper Valor, citing sources close to Temer, reported Embraer would take a substantial 49 percent of the new company. But people familiar with the negotiations told Reuters Boeing would only agree to a joint venture in which it held 80 percent to 90 percent of the company and had full operational control.
The potential deal has snagged on concerns in Brasilia that Washington would get final say over Brazilian defense programs and use of technology developed in the country, including satellite and air-traffic control systems.
The Brazilian government holds a ""golden share"" in Embraer giving it veto power over strategic decisions involving military programs and any change in controlling interest.
Boeing has worked to overcome the Brazilian military's objections with alternatives that would preserve the government's strategic veto rights and ensure safeguards for its defense programs, sources have told Reuters. 

The partnership would give Boeing a leading share of the 70- to 130-seat market and create stiffer competition for the CSeries program designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and run by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR) since last year.

The talks between management and the trade union Verdi are continuing, they said. 
The union has called for a meeting of its wage commission for Wednesday to discuss any wage agreement or further protests if talks should break down. It is seeking a 6 percent wage increase or more time off.
The negotiations in the northwestern German town of Much come after warning strikes last week [nL8N1QC1O0].
""Deutsche Post is swimming in money, but they expect employees to go empty-handed. Staff and Verdi will not accept that,"" Anton Hirtreiter of Verdi in Bavaria said last week.
Strong economic growth and low unemployment in Germany is bolstering unions in their wage demands, with industrial union Earlier this month, the union IG Metall agreed a 4.3 percent raise and the right to shorter working hours [nL8N1PW1KH].
Deutsche Post DHL Group is targeting earnings before interest and tax of around 3.75 billion euros ($4.59 billion)for 2017, which would be a 7 percent increase from last year's 3.49 billion.
Verdi held a series of strikes at Deutsche Post in 2015 in a dispute over pay and plans for a new parcel division. Those walkouts, one of which lasted four weeks, cost the firm 100 million euros at the time.

Green companies have been neglected, despite President Xi Jinping’s high-profile campaign to reduce pollution in the country, as investors continue to pile into better known blue chips. That suits the French money manager, which oversees one of the best-performing China equities funds of the past five years. Getting in early helped OFI AM pocket a 450 percent gain in distiller Kweichow Moutai Co. and 300 percent in Ping An Insurance (Group) Co.
“It’s a no brainer for me,” said Xinghang Li, who helps manage about $500 million as head of emerging markets at OFI AM in Paris. “While you can’t expect the Chinese consumer to drink 30 percent more alcohol every year, the environmental sector can easily see that kind of growth.”
For Li, 39, China’s future looks a whole lot cleaner from Paris, the city that lent its name to a climate rulebook signed by almost every country worldwide. His top picks are Beijing Originwater Technology Co. and Tus-Sound Environmental Resources Co., as well as Hong Kong-listed Beijing Enterprises Water Group Ltd. and China Everbright International Ltd. All command valuations that are near multi-year lows.
Li says the four companies have an edge over rivals because of their market share and strong ties to government entities, teeing them up for financing support even amid tougher scrutiny around public-private partnerships. That will help their profits grow at least 20 percent annually over the next five years, according to Li. Analysts predict earnings-per-share growth will exceed that rate for all four stocks this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
OFI AM’s new picks signal a departure from crowd favorites such as Shanghai-listed Moutai, which Li bought when the baijiu maker’s shares were trading under 150 yuan after China’s corruption crackdown stoked fears of a slump in demand. Patience paid off when he sold his stake in the company about four years later. Li, who joined OFI AM in 2011, is once again sitting tight.
“I remember when I bought Moutai, the share price did not go up right away,” he says. “I would rather position myself and wait.”"

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 12:13PM ET</span>",Fidelity parent says profit surges despite stock fund withdrawals,"By Ross Kerber and Tim McLaughlin
BOSTON (Reuters) - The parent of Fidelity Investments said on Tuesday that operating profit in 2017 rose 54 percent to $5.3 billion, even as customers continued to yank billions of dollars from its actively managed mutual funds. 
Assets under management rose 15 percent to $2.45 trillion, said FMR LLC, the privately held parent of Fidelity, lagging the 22 percent gains at rivals BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and T. Rowe Price Group Inc (O:TROW). Fidelity said it was hurt by $47 billion in net withdrawals from its stable of actively managed stock funds.
FMR said revenue rose 13.7 percent to $18.2 billion for 2017.
""While active equity mutual fund flows remained under pressure across the financial services industry, Fidelity continued to grow its non–mutual fund, actively managed assets, which have increased from $18 billion at the end of 2009 to $124 billion at the end of 2017,"" according to the company’s annual report.
Despite the outflows, Fidelity funds outperformed most of their peers. In aggregate, Fidelity said its mutual funds beat 78 percent, 77 percent and 76 percent of their peers for the trailing one-, three-, and five-year periods, respectively.
Fidelity Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Abigail Johnson, a rare female leader in the financial services industry at the family-controlled business, told staff in October the company had no tolerance for any type of harassment after the dismissal of a well-known manager.
Johnson made no mention of the matter in her letter to investors in the report, instead emphasizing how the company is adapting to new competition. 
Fidelity is best known for its stock-picking mutual funds like Contrafund (O:FCNTX) and Magellan (O:FMAGX). But it has lost ground to cheaper, passively managed funds offered by BlackRock and Vanguard Group as retail clients focused on cutting expenses in recent years. 
In response, Fidelity has worked to grow its business running money outside of traditional mutual funds, like collective investment trusts, separately managed accounts and exchange-traded funds. Assets in such vehicles stood at $124 billion at the end of 2017, the company said, up from $18 billion at the end of 2009.
The new money helped offset the active-fund outflows, Fidelity said, and ""demonstrates that customers still see value in active management, but many are looking for exposure to different types of investment vehicles.""

Assets under administration rose 19 percent to $6.8 trillion at the end of 2017, Fidelity said.

Earlier on Tuesday, the Mexican sugar chamber said U.S. refiners had asked for a review of its compliance with a sugar trade deal. The head of the sugar chamber said the industry was not ""overly concerned"" about it.
Asked whether Guajardo would be discussing sugar trade with Ross, Mexico's chief NAFTA negotiator, Kenneth Smith, said Mexico and the United States had agreements to manage trade in sugar and tomatoes, which were periodically reviewed. He did not confirm whether those two issues were on the agenda.
Mexico has expressed concern about curbs on steel and aluminum imports being considered by U.S. President Donald Trump, including a proposed 24 percent tariff on steel products from all countries. Trump could exclude certain countries from the tariffs.
Mexico's fraught ties with Trump hit another bump following weekend reports that a testy phone call between him and his Mexican counterpart, Enrique Pena Nieto, led to the cancellation of a planned meeting between the two in Washington.
Trump is pushing for a border wall, which he promised during his campaign that Mexico would pay for. The Mexican government has said it will not do so. The U.S. president also frequently threatens to abandon NAFTA unless big changes are made to a pact he blames for U.S. manufacturing job losses.

The ECB said at the weekend that privately held ABLV is likely unable to pay its debts or other liabilities as they fall due.
""We believe our bank will be able to settle with all of our clients in full,"" ABLV, Latvia's third-biggest bank by assets, said in a statement.
""Voluntary liquidation is an important condition for it – the process has to be done as professionally and as transparently as possible, given the history of Latvian insolvency and liquidation processes.""
ABLV, whose customers are mostly residents of the Commonwealth of Independent States, was accused by U.S. authorities of large-scale money laundering this month, leading clients to pull money from the bank.
ABLV denies the accusations.
Most domestic lending in Latvia is conducted by Nordic banks such as Sweden's SEB and Swedbank. Many of Latvia's other banks are funded mainly from deposits by non-residents and have only limited domestic lending operations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. bank profits were down 40.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 from a year earlier, due primarily to one-time accounting changes from the new tax law which is expected to boost profits in the long run, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) said on Tuesday.
Absent the changes spurred by the tax law, bank profits were estimated to drop just 2.3 percent to $42.2 billion in the fourth quarter, according to the regulator. Net interest income was up 8.5 percent to $129.5 billion.
The brunt of the tax-spurred decline was borne by larger banks, who had already been reporting eye-popping losses at the end of 2017. Large institutions took a disproportionate hit on earnings held abroad and the rewriting of the value on deferred tax assets.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), for example, reported an $18 billion loss at the end of 2017 thanks to the updated tax law. 
But banks are expected to be significant beneficiaries of the revamped tax code in the long run, thanks to a significant lowering of the corporate tax rate.
FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg said the industry's performance remains positive, as the number of problem banks dropped to just 95, the lowest level since the first quarter of 2008. 
""Notwithstanding the one-time impact of the new tax law, the overall performance of the industry continued to be positive,"" he said.
However, he said low interest rates and a competitive lending environment has led some banks to reach for yield, heightening risks.

""The industry must manage interest-rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk carefully to continue to grow on a long-run, sustainable path,"" said Gruenberg.

1037,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 10:17AM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs just shattered a myth about how higher rates affect stocks,"It's conventional wisdom that when interest rates rise, investors should steer clear of stocks with high dividend yields.
The logic is simple: rising rates make the yields offered by equities less attractive by comparison. And since those stocks rely so heavily on their appeal as so-called ""yield proxies,"" any competition can lead to selling.
While Goldman Sachs acknowledges this dynamic is true to a degree, it also argues stock gains can still be found among high dividend payers — as long as investors know where to look.
To Goldman, the key is not how much these stocks are paying in dividends, but how quickly they're growing that yield. By their measure, the top 25% of dividend growers in the S&P 500 have actually outperformed during past rising-rate environments.
""With the spectre of rising rates, we expect that dividend growth stocks will be relatively more immune,"" Goldman analyst Jessica Binder Graham wrote in a client note. ""We find that the high dividend growth stocks not only outperform high yield, low growth stocks during rising rate environments ... but also continue to outperform the broader index.""
This is an important discussion to be having right now, considering the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates three times in 2018, with more hawkish commentators calling for four hikes. In a written testimony released Tuesday morning, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell did nothing to shift these expectations.
“Some of the headwinds the US economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,” said Powell. “Fiscal policy has become more stimulative and foreign demand for US exports is on a firmer trajectory.’’
As income investors — or traders who seek yields such as those provided by dividends — await further signals from Powell and the Fed, they can rest easy knowing there's at least one segment of their universe that should stand tall as rates rise."

The offer could throw a wrench into 21st Century Fox’s previously attempts to increase its stake in Sky from 40% to a majority 61% before selling the company to Disney.
For years now, 21st Century Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch has  made multiple attempts to buy the British satellite operator, but suffered a major setback in June 2017 when the UK government said it would refer the possible deal to regulators.
Fox has already agreed on paper to sell its stake in Sky to Disney  as part of a $52.4 billion (£37.5 billion) package of film and TV assets. At the time the deal was announced, 21st Century Fox said it remained  ""committed to completing its proposed acquisition of the shares in Sky it does not own.""
Comcast was one of the interested bidders in Fox's entertainment assets, according to multiple reports.
Comcast says it is “confident that we will be able to receive the necessary regulatory approvals,” and Wall Street seems to agree.
“We expect this deal to go through as we do not think Fox (or Disney, who are acquiring the Sky assets as part of their purchase of various Fox assets) will want to get into a bidding war, especially given the complications surrounding Sky News,” Liberium media analyst Ian Whittaker said in a note Tuesday morning.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks suffered on Tuesday their biggest daily drops since the selloff three weeks ago after comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell revived fears about more interest-rate increases than expected this year.
Powell gave an upbeat view on the U.S. economy and said data has strengthened his confidence on inflation. Traders boosted bets the central bank will squeeze in a fourth rate hike this year following the remarks.
Bond yields also rose, while the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility of the S&P 500 index, rose 2.79 points to 18.59, its largest one-day gain also in nearly three weeks.
Powell's first semi-annual economic testimony as Fed chief before the U.S. Congress comes at a sensitive time for the market, which had been trying to recover from the recent selloff, which confirmed the market was in a correction, or down 10 percent from a Jan. 26 record high. Fears over rising rates in part had sparked the selloff.
In his prepared remarks, Powell hinted that the central bank would stick to its current path of gradual rate hikes, but his comments during congressional testimony seemed to spook the market.
""He said it's his impression the economy was getting stronger, which subtly gave the indication that he was going to raise his personal forecast for four rate hikes this year,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.
The Fed is widely expected to raise rates next month and in December signaled a total of three rate hikes this year. Fed officials will release new forecasts, including their views on the appropriate future path of rate hikes, when they meet next month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 299.24 points, or 1.16 percent, to 25,410.03, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 35.32 points, or 1.27 percent, to 2,744.28 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 91.11 points, or 1.23 percent, to 7,330.35.
Indexes posted their biggest daily percentage losses since Feb. 8. 
""Sure enough, rates here have moved up a little bit as well, probably a little bit more so here based on his testimony, but I don't think we are in a danger zone or anything of a spike in rate hikes by the Fed,"" said Mark Kepner, managing director, sales and trading in Chatham, New Jersey. 
Comcast (O:CMCSA) fell 7.4 percent after the U.S. cable giant offered to buy Sky (L:SKYB) for $31 billion in an unsolicited approach, taking on Rupert Murdoch's Fox and Bob Iger's Walt  Disney  in the battle for Europe's biggest pay-TV group.
The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500. Disney (N:DIS) dropped 4.5 percent and Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) fell 3 percent following the news.
Macy's (N:M) rose 3.5 percent after reporting higher-than-expected same-store sales growth for the fourth quarter. The biggest U.S. department store chain said sales at established stores could mark their first annual gain in four years.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 44 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 50 new lows. 

About 7.4 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges. That compares with the 8.3 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

""President Trump has reached an informal deal with Boeing on a fixed-price contract for the new Air Force One Program,"" Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told Reuters. He said the contract will save taxpayers more than $1.4 billion, but those savings could not be independently confirmed.
Trump has said Boeing's costs to build replacements for Air Force One aircraft - one of the most visible symbols of the U.S. presidency - were too high and urged the federal government in a tweet to ""Cancel order!""
The Boeing 747-8s are designed to be an airborne White House able to fly in worst-case security scenarios, such as nuclear war, and are modified with military avionics, advanced communications and a self-defense system.
""President Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people,"" Boeing said in a news release.
U.S. aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia said the White House was engaging in ""political theater.""
""There's no evidence of a discount,"" said Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group.
Earlier this month, the Pentagon released Air Force budget documents for fiscal year 2019 disclosing the $3.9 billion cost for the two-aircraft program. The same 2018 budget document, not adjusted for inflation, showed the price at $3.6 billion. 
Boeing would only have so much room to offer discounts given the high proportion of supplier content on Air Force One, from refrigerators to missile warning systems, Aboulafia said by phone. 
The big U.S. defense contractor said the deal includes work to develop and build two planes, including unique items such as a communications package, internal and external stairs, large galleys and other equipment.
The ""informal deal"" will need to be codified in a formal contract with comprehensive, complex terms and conditions said Franklin Turner, a partner specializing in government contracts at law firm McCarter & English, suggesting a final deal was still a ways off.

Boeing stock was up 1.4 percent at $368.54, trading at an all-time high.

(Reuters) - Fitbit Inc's (N:FIT) shares fell 14 percent in early trading on Tuesday after the company said its newly launched smartwatch was not selling as expected, raising concerns about the company's ability to become profitable again in the near term.
The wearable device maker on Monday posted its fifth straight quarter of loss, gave a disappointing forecast for the first quarter, and acknowledged competitive pressures in the smartwatch market.
Fitbit, whose colorful fitness-tracking wrist bands became must-haves for fitness enthusiasts a few years ago, has struggled in recent quarters as Apple (O:AAPL) and Samsung (KS:005930) step up their game in the wearable devices market and China's Xiaomi woos users with cheaper products.
""Significant declines in devices sold year-over-year and significant quarterly losses do not inspire confidence in the company's ability to quickly return to profitability,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Alicia Reese said in a note.
Fitbit's shares, which are trading 76 percent below their IPO price, have fallen 10 percent in the past 12 months. The short interest on Fitbit's outstanding shares is 16 percent.
Analysts have said the stock price will continue to be under pressure in the near-term.
The company said on Monday that its Ionic smartwatch, launched in October and priced at $300, was not selling as expected because it was not a ""mass-appeal"" smartwatch.
Executives tried to reassure investors that the company was focused on selling more smartwatches that would attract a broader user base in 2018.
For comparison, Apple's smartwatches range from $329-$1,399.
""We would become further negative on the stock if coming smartwatch launches do not sufficiently improve or differentiate the ecosystem,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.
Fitbit Chief Executive James Park also reiterated the company's focus on healthcare services - using fitness data to connect users with doctors, hospitals and lifestyle coaches. This business is expected to give the company a more predictable stream of revenue.
Earlier this month, Fitbit acquired startup Twine Health to boost its healthcare services.
Analysts, however, remained skeptical about how quickly this business will ramp.
""The company has an excellent opportunity ahead with medical applications, but it is unlikely that subscription revenue will contribute meaningfully before 2019,"" Wedbush's Reese wrote.

LONDON (Reuters) - Avoiding chaos in the insurance market due to Britain's European Union exit is a top Bank of England priority and making sure cross-border contracts continue to pay out after Brexit is a major concern, its deputy governor Sam Woods said.
But a senior industry official said that Brussels appears in no hurry to take legislative steps to guarantee continuity in contracts, preferring instead that British insurers open hubs in the bloc or transfer the policies to entities there.
Woods said on Tuesday the BoE was putting a ""huge premium"" on the British government agreeing a transition or implementation period by the end of March before Brexit in 2019.
The BoE has told insurers to submit plans on how they would cope with a ""hard"" Brexit or Britain crashing out of the EU.
""We are pretty much up to speed in terms of plans,"" Woods told the Association of British Insurers annual conference.
John Glen, Britain's financial services minister, said he recognized that Brexit talks were creating uncertainty.
""This government is working flat out to secure a deal that protects the interests of our financial services industry,"" Glen said in a video message to the conference. 
PRAGMATIC APPROACH
Andy Briggs, chair of ABI and chief executive of Aviva's (L:AV) UK insurance arm, said it was unclear whether cross-border policies being renewed in March would still be enforceable after Britain leaves the bloc.
""We need a transitional approach agreed now. ""Let's be pragmatic and customer focused,"" Briggs said, adding that otherwise insurers will have set up new subsidiaries in the bloc to ensure continuity of service to customers.
Potential problems arise because there are 6 million British insurance policyholders with so-called EU27 insurers and 30 million EU policyholders with British firms.
British regulators have proposed a joint effort with counterparts in the bloc to ensure continuity for insurance and derivatives contracts, but Woods said there has been no response from the EU27 so far.
But Michaela Koller, director general of Insurance Europe, an industry body, said the thinking among some officials from the bloc's executive European Commission is that many of the contracts only covered periods of up to a year in any case.
Regarding long-term policies of up to 30 years or more, Koller said the thinking in Brussels is that the only fix is to transfer them to the EU, such as in new hubs.

But Woods said the problems would not be solved by firms themselves given the time frame involved.

Walmart has been acquiring small online brands like Shoebuy, Modcloth and Bonobos over the past year to boost growth in the clothing and accessories business, where consumers are increasingly shopping online.
In November, the retailer tied up with department store operator Lord & Taylor by offering it dedicated space on Walmart's website.
The new private brands, which are owned by the retailer, will be available in Walmart stores and online starting March 1, the company said on Tuesday.
The launch comes at a time when younger consumers are showing signs of being more receptive to Amazon's apparel offerings than its rivals, according to analysts.
A new survey of 1,699 shoppers by Coresight Research showed Amazon's apparel category has sharply gained in popularity, with footwear and casual clothing proving to be the online retailer's most popular categories and ease of browsing its biggest draw.
Walmart, which is still the largest clothing retailer in the United States, is upgrading the apparel section in its stores with improved displays, open floor plans and better fitting rooms, it said.

Walmart's brands, priced from less than $5 to $30, include women's apparel brand Time and Tru, plus-sized women's clothing line Terra & Sky, kids apparel under Wonder Nation and men's clothing under the name George.

DETROIT (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales in February likely fell just over 2 percent from the same month in 2017 as the market continues to cool following a boom for much of this decade, industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Tuesday.
February was marked by a slight decline in consumer discounts, which have risen as major automakers have pushed to move vehicles off dealer lots despite declining demand.
""The industry is expected to deliver mixed results in February, with a decline in retail sales volume, higher transaction prices and the potential for the first year-over-year drop in incentive spending in more than four years,"" said Thomas King, senior vice president of J.D. Power's data and analytics division.
February U.S. new vehicle sales will likely be about 1.304 million units, a decrease of just over 2 percent from 1.332 million units a year earlier, the consultancies said.
The forecast was based on the first 15 selling days of February. Automakers will release February U.S. sales results on March 1.
U.S. new vehicle sales fell 2 percent in 2017 to 17.23 million units after hitting a record high in 2016. They are expected to drop further in 2018 as interest rates rise and more late-model used cars return to dealer lots to compete with new ones.
LMC said it expects full-year 2018 U.S. new vehicle sales to hit just under 17 million units.
The seasonally adjusted annualized rate for February will be 17.1 million vehicles, down nearly 2 percent from 17.4 million units in February 2017, the consultancies said.
Retail sales to consumers, which do not include lower-margin fleet sales to rental agencies, businesses and government, were set to fall a little over 3 percent in February.
The average discount per vehicle in February fell $14 versus the same month in 2017, to $3,840.
But discounts still hit 10.2 percent of manufacturer's recommended sales prices. Experts believe anything over 10 percent hurts vehicle resale values and is unhealthy for automakers.
The consultancies noted that discounts have exceeded 10 percent in 19 of the last 20 months.
They said lower discounts only affected popular SUVs and pickup trucks offered by U.S. manufacturers - a reference to General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA).
While a reduction in discounts ""in some segments of the market is a positive indicator for the long-term health of the industry, sustaining lower levels of incentives will be challenging,"" the consultancies said.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 09:49AM ET</span>",Walt Disney makes 2 billion euros investment in Disneyland Paris,"By Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) - The Walt  Disney  Company (N:DIS) announced a 2 billion euro ($2.5 billion) investment to expand its French theme park Disneyland Paris after taking full control of the business last year.
Chief Executive Bob Iger announced the spending plan after meeting President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, saying it reflected the U.S. media group's positive view on France and Europe more widely.
""This investment...is the direct result of the growing confidence that we have in the economy of Europe and in France in particular,"" Iger said in a video posted on the French Presidency's twitter account.
However, Iger suffered a blow on Tuesday when U.S. cable giant Comcast (O:CMCSA) offered to buy European broadcaster Sky for $31 billion, potentially derailing Disney's own bid for assets owned by Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA). 
The Disneyland development will include three new areas based on Marvel superheroes such as Spider-Man and the Hulk, Disney's animated film Frozen and Star Wars, and will be rolled out in phases, starting in 2021. There will also be new attractions and live entertainment experiences.
""The expansion plan is one of the most ambitious development projects at Disneyland Paris since its opening in 1992 and underscores the company's commitment to the long-term success of the resort as Disney's brand beacon in Europe,"" Walt Disney said in a statement.
TOURISM REBOUNDS
Macron, a former investment banker pushing through social and economic reforms, said Iger's financial commitment reflected renewed investor belief in France. 
""Your confidence shows that France is back,"" Macron said in his own tweet.
Disneyland Paris is Europe's most visited theme park. It sits on a 2,230-hectare site about 32 kilometres (20 miles ) east of Paris, though only half of site has been developed so far, according to the company's 2016 annual report.
With more than 320 million visitors passing through its turnstiles since 1992, the park accounts for 6.2 percent of France's tourism income and has been a boon for local employment, employing some 16,000 staff. 
Even so, Euro Disney faced deep financial troubles after making overly optimistic projections on visitor numbers and taking on too much debt. 
Walt Disney took control of the ailing company in June 2017 and de-listed its shares. 
Its new investment drive comes amid a rebound in French tourism after the industry was weakened by a series of Islamist militant attacks in Paris, Nice and other cities. 
Euro Disney racked up a net loss of 858 million euros in 2016 as visitor numbers fell 10 percent to 13.4 million.
However, 2017 marked the French capital's best year for tourism in at least a decade.
Disneyland Paris comprises two theme parks - the fairytale-themed Disneyland Park and the Walt Disney Studios Park. Its seven hotels have some 5,800 bedrooms, two convention centers and a golf course.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 01:43PM ET</span>",Macy's shares jump at first sign of sales turnaround,"By Meredith Mazzilli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) on Tuesday said sales at established stores could mark their first annual gain in four years, pinning its hopes on a new loyalty program, more off-price selling and private-label brands. 
The biggest U.S. department store chain also beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit and comparable sales growth on the back of a broadly strong U.S. holiday season. 
Whiles the results and outlook sent shares 5 percent higher, they also come as the wider retail industry stands to gain from higher consumer confidence and a boost to spending from U.S. tax cuts, potentially making Macy's call for flat to 1 percent established store growth in fiscal 2018 seem less impressive. 
And Macy's multi-faceted approach to stem its sales slide may not provide a comprehensive long-term solution, some cautioned. 
Macy's, which has existed in some form for more than 150 years, is struggling to right itself while revamping marketing and merchandising, squeezing money from real estate assets and growing its Backstage brand launched in 2015 that competes with TJ Maxx owner TJX Cos Inc (N:TJX). 
""I call it the scattergun approach: they're doing a lot of different things, but there doesn’t seem to be a coherent or clear focus to bring many of these things together,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of retail research firm Global Data.
The retailer has been emblematic of the decline of brick-and-mortar in the face of competition from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), closing more than 100 stores since 2015 and slashing thousands of jobs as mall traffic plummeted and customers defected to off-price and fast-fashion sellers.
But sales at stores open more than 12 months, including in departments licensed to third parties, rose 1.4 percent in the quarter ended Feb. 3. That marked the first rise for the measure in 12 quarters and beat the average analyst estimate of a 0.31 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
Still, previously reported comparable sales growth in November and December lagged rivals', suggesting Macy’s lost market share during the key shopping months. Macy's is the first major retailer to report full holiday-quarter results.
Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said on a call to discuss the earnings that Macy's plans to add 100 Backstage stores in 2018, including in some premium mall locations. 
The company has said putting Backstage stores in existing locations can lure foot traffic, and the ""treasure hunting"" of off-price shopping is hard to replicate online. 
Comparable sales fell 2.2 percent in fiscal 2017 on an owned basis and 1.9 percent on an owned-plus-licensed basis. 
Gross margin, which measures how much the company makes on each dollar of sales, slipped slightly in the quarter. 
But it was a smaller fall than the company had guided for, with Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet on Tuesday crediting a stronger merchandise margin thanks to inventory controls. 
Shares in Macy's jumped as much as 13 percent and were last up 4.8 percent at $28.77. Rival JC Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) also surged early but pared gains to trade up 1.8 percent. 
Macy's also operates the Bloomingdale’s and Bloomingdale's outlet brands and the Bluemercury beauty and spa stores it bought in 2015. 
SELLING REAL ESTATE 
Macy's has worked to generate cash by renting or selling its real estate, even considering unloading floors at its storied Herald Square (NYSE:SQ) flagship in New York.
Macy's partnered with Brookfield Asset Management in 2016 to let the real estate developer come up with plans to redevelop 50 properties.
On Tuesday, Macy's said agreements have been reached for nine assets which, if sold, would be worth about $50 million. 
It also said it inked a deal to sell the top floors of its State Street store in Chicago for $30 million and is exploring selling a chunk of its Union Square building in San Francisco.
Macy's adjusted earnings per share were $2.82 for the quarter, excluding restructuring and U.S. tax overhaul impacts, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.71.
Revenue rose 1.8 percent to $8.67 billion, in line with estimates.
Before Tuesday, Macy's shares were up more than 50 percent since November, but are well below a mid-2015 peak of more than $73.

(Reuters) - U.S. luxury homebuilder  Toll Brothers  Inc (N:TOL) reported a first-quarter profit on Tuesday that beat analysts' estimates as it sold more homes at higher prices, easing some concerns about a slowdown in the housing industry.
Shares of the company, which builds homes that can cost upwards of $2 million, rose as much as 3.6 percent to $49.23 in morning trading.
The results come a day after Commerce Department data suggested a year-on-year drop in sales of new U.S. single-family homes in January, the first drop in five months.
Separately, mortgage application activity in the country fell as interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate home loans jumped to their highest in four years, the Mortgage Bankers Association said earlier this month.
Given these concerns, Toll Brothers' beat on most major metrics is expected to soothe some investor worries, MKM Partners analyst Megan McGrath said.
The Pennsylvania-based company said orders — a metric indicating future revenue for homebuilders — rose 19.7 percent to 1,822 homes in the reported quarter, boosted by growth in the Western United States, including California.
""The new home industry appears to be building momentum with the national home ownership rate rising over the past year,"" Executive Chairman Robert Toll said. 
The company's average price of homes sold increased 6.8 percent to $826,000 in the reported quarter, while the number of homes sold surged 19.6 percent to 1,423 from a year earlier.
Toll Brothers raised the lower end of its full-year average price forecast to $820,000 from $810,000, keeping the high end at $860,000.
However, higher costs including labor and raw material expenses have weighed on margins in the sector.
Toll Brothers forecast adjusted gross margin of 22.8 percent for the second quarter, down from the 24.3 percent it reported a year earlier.
The company also tightened its full-year revenue outlook to between $6.40 billion and $7.40 billion, from $6.24 billion to $7.48 billion.
The company's net income rose 87.6 percent to $132.1 million, or 83 cents per share, partly benefiting from the U.S. tax reform. Excluding that, it earned 63 cents a share, beating average analysts' estimate of 61 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Revenue rose 27.7 percent to $1.18 billion, slightly falling short of estimates.

The company's earnings have missed estimates only twice in the last eight quarters while its revenue has missed estimates for the third straight quarter.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's state-controlled  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) on Tuesday said it would return 2.5 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of excess capital to shareholders over the next three years in an effort to pay back part of public bailout cash.
Bankia got a 22.4 billion-euro rescue package in 2012 to recover from property-loan losses at the height of Spain's financial crisis. The government is now selling off the 61 percent stake it holds. 
The bank's chairman, Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, said institutional investors were interested in taking part in its privatization. Spain's bailout fund FROB has until the end of 2019 to sell its stake in the bank.
As part of its 2018-2020 strategic plan, Bankia is shifting away from mortgage lending and increasing volume growth by segments, such as consumer lending, property development and corporate activities, after the European Union lifted some restrictions. 
In an effort to boost earnings, Bankia agreed in June to acquire BMN to create Spain's fourth largest bank. In its turnaround plan, Bankia also it would invest around 1 billion euros as part of its digital push.
On Tuesday, Bankia said it would raise its dividend pay-out ratio to 45 to 50 percent in 2018-2020 from a current 41.7 percent, leading to a dividend-per-share of 0.43 euros in 2020 versus 0.26 euros in 2017.
Goirigolzarri said share buybacks or extraordinary dividends could also be an option for returning capital [L8N1QG6AT].
Bankia said it would finish 2020 with a core-tier 1 fully loaded capital ratio, the strictest term of solvency, of above 12 percent. All capital above this threshold will be paid back to shareholders.
On Tuesday, at 1119 GMT, Bankia shares were up 1 percent as Spain's leading index, the Ibex-35 (IBEX) was down about 0.2 percent. 
The lender said it expects profit of 1.3 billion euros in 2020 and hopes to increase its return on equity to an adjusted 10.8 percent in 2020 from 6.6 percent at the end of 2017, thanks to higher interest rates and banking fees.
Bankia also said the BMN transaction was expected to generate gross cost synergies of 190 million euros in 2020.
As part of its ongoing effort to clean up its balance sheet, Bankia said it expected to reduce its non-performing assets by 9 billion euros in the next three years as Spain's economy continues to recover. It said it was considering selling a real estate asset portfolio to a third party [L8N1QG6AT].
It also said it would end 2020 with a non-performing loan ratio of less than 4 percent compared to 8.9 percent in 2017.

Discovery said on Tuesday advertising revenue from its U.S. networks rose 8 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, while ad revenue from international networks climbed 11 percent.
The company also said it expects to close its $14.6 billion acquisition of U.S. peer Scripps Network Interactive (O:SNI) by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Discovery is awaiting the completion of a review by regulators in Ireland.
Discovery said its net loss was $1.14 billion in the fourth quarter, compared to a profit of $304 million, a year earlier. Results included a $1.3 billion one-time goodwill impairment charge.
Excluding one-time items, Discovery earned 47 cents per share.
Revenue rose 11.5 percent to $1.86 billion, beating analysts' estimates of $1.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) offered a sunny business outlook on Tuesday, saying higher interest rates, increased automation and growth in all of its business units could boost pretax profit by 17.5 percent over the next few years.
Having used its size and stability to gain market share in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, JPMorgan is already the largest U.S. bank by assets and the most profitable among its top rivals.
It is trying to improve customers' interactions, largely through better technology, spending an additional $1.4 billion in the area this year. The efforts could help annual pretax net income rise to a range of $44 billion to $47 billion over the next three years, up from $24 billion last year, JPMorgan said.
Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake spoke at length about technology during the bank's annual investor day in New York detailing how JPMorgan on improve technology. Two bulky sections of her presentation were titled ""Digital everything"" and ""Payments everywhere.""
""We want to be relevant to our clients and we want to grow,"" Lake said. JPMorgan has a ""complete strategy and a plan for every customer type,"" she added.
Lake said JPMorgan is trying to fill market share gaps in small business lending, corporate treasury services and mortgage lending. The bank is hiring more bankers and using technology to catch up.
JPMorgan shares added 0.1 percent at $118.91. The stock hit an all-time closing high of $118.77 on Monday and is up 11 percent year to date. By comparison, the KBW Bank index (BKX) is up 8 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index (SPX) has risen 4 percent.
In addition to JPMorgan's outlook for pretax profits, the bank projected that returns on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a widely watched measure of how well banks use shareholder money, could rise to 17 percent in the coming years.
The outlook was in line with analysts' expectations.
Last year, its ROTCE was 13 percent, excluding one-time items, compared with 11 percent at  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS), and 8 percent at  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).
""Management continues to play the long game and build even bigger competitive moats around each of its businesses by making smart growth and control-related investments that some smaller and/or less profitable peers can't fully do,"" Evercore ISI bank analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note on Tuesday.
Marking a change from previous investor conferences, Lake, 48, was given a more prominent role, providing updates on each of the company's four major business segments as well as an overview of the company.
The chief executive officers of the four businesses, who have made presentations in the past, this year went to the podium to take questions.

The changes were designed to shorten the conference, a person familiar with the matter said. The shift raises Lake's profile as a leading contender to replace CEO Jamie Dimon, 61, who recently said he will step down in about five years. Lake was named CFO in 2012.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coworking start-up Industrious said on Tuesday it raised $80 million to help double its number of sites to up to 60 this year and grow its roster of corporate clients as shared office space makes further inroads into U.S. commercial real estate.
Industrious said it expanded its footprint to 25 U.S. cities in 2017 and grew revenue by 150 percent annually over the past three years, and it now has the largest nationwide U.S. coworking network behind WeWork and IWG Plc (L:IWG), known formerly as Regus. 
""The hardest thing in this business is to plant a flag in a new city. Everything takes twice as long and costs more to acquire customers,"" Jamie Hodari, co-founder and chief executive of Industrious, told Reuters.
""If you look at the rest of the industry, they'll go very deep in one city because it's a lot easier than going and trying to do first-time locations,"" he said.
Coworking is meeting the corporate demand for lower costs and more flexibility in leases, a workforce that is more entrepreneurial and tenants that care more about community and the environment, according to a recent study by Yardi Matrix. 
Coworking firms typically sign 10-year leases and then offer short-term or monthly contracts to companies that want more flexible office space for their changing employment needs.
The industry is forecast to grow to more than 6,000 sites by 2022 from less than dozen a decade ago, according to Emergent Research and GCUC. 
New York-based Industrious has now raised a total of $142 million after the Series C, or third round of fundraising, the most of any U.S. coworking firm besides WeWork, according to database Crunchbase.
At the moment, coworking accounts for just a fraction of U.S. office leases. But WeWork has been the largest leaser of office space in Manhattan the past three years, and large developers or building managers such as Hines and Equity Office, owned by the Blackstone Group (N:BX), are actively seeking coworking partners.
""Now is the time when people are picking partners. They're going to pick which provider they're going to double down with,"" Hodari said, referring to corporations that over the past 12 months have experimented with coworking.
Industrious currently expects to have 35 sites open by April and from 50 to 60 locations by year's end as it mostly expands within the cities where it is now established. 
The firm plans to increase its footprint in New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Dallas, and expects to soon open multiple locations in both Boston and San Francisco, tech-centric cities that are not currently part of its U.S. network.
Lead investors in the latest fundraising round were Riverwood Capital and Fifth Wall Ventures. Investors also included Wells Fargo's Strategic Capital, private wealth firm Schechter Private Capital and Rabina Properties, among others.
Hodari expects revenues to triple this year, and then double to triple in 2019, but he declined to discuss an exit strategy from the company's fundraising. If the firm were to go public, it should be big enough to do so in two years, Hodari said. 
Industrious has 135 employees and expects to hire 80 people this year. It counts Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), Lyft Inc, Fullscreen Inc, Hyatt Corp, Instacart, Pandora Media Inc and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ) as corporate clients.

LONDON (Reuters) - Nearly all the senior employees in Royal Bank of Scotland's (L:RBS) business turnaround division also worked for its predecessor, which is alleged to have pushed firms into bankruptcy, British lawmakers said on Tuesday. 
Figures released by RBS showed that the unit, whose predecessor is at the center of a political storm over its treatment of troubled businesses, had merely been rebranded, Treasury Select Committee Chair Nicky Morgan said.
RBS disclosed that 30 of its 32 senior restructuring managers (94 percent) worked at both the new division and the since-closed Global Restructuring Group (GRG), which handled some 12,000 small business customers between 2007 and 2012. 
Some of its customers alleged GRG pushed them into bankruptcy in order to pick up their assets on the cheap. 
This allegation was not upheld in a report into the scandal commissioned by the Financial Conduct Authority, but it did outline failings and examples of bad behavior by GRG staff. 
Chief Executive Ross McEwan had told the committee on Jan. 30 that the culture of RBS restructuring today is fundamentally different, and that only two senior managers had previously worked in the former unit. 
In evidence attached to the committee's statement on Tuesday, RBS said McEwan had been referring to the ""most senior"" management grade.
""The discovery that almost all the senior management in the new unit previously worked at GRG raises concerns that there has merely been a rebranding exercise,"" Morgan said. 
The bank also disclosed that 136 of 182 (75 percent) of existing RBS restructuring staff of all grades worked in GRG.
RBS has accepted some wrongdoing and set aside 400 million pounds ($558 million) to compensate firms and try and draw a line under the saga which has weighed on its efforts to rebuild its image in the decade since the financial crisis. 
An RBS spokeswoman said on Tuesday that the bank had made significant changes in line with recommendations from the report and was now focused on rebuilding trust with customers. 
“The culture, structure and way RBS operates today have all changed fundamentally... and we have made significant changes to deal with the issues of the past, including how we treat customers in financial distress,"" she said. 
Lawmakers also said on Tuesday that the bank had disclosed that it had paid out 1 million pounds in direct loss claims under the redress scheme, and expects to pay out a total of less than 5 million pounds in such claims.

There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests, meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx), known to cause respiratory disease.
While other countries are also considering restrictions on diesel cars, a ban in the birthplace of the modern automobile is a new blow for the car industry, and an embarrassment for Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, which opposes bans.
The ruling by the country's highest federal administrative court came after German states had appealed against bans imposed by local courts in Stuttgart and Duesseldorf in cases brought by environmental group DUH over poor air quality.
Merkel's government, which has come under fire for its close ties to the car industry, had lobbied against a ban, fearing it could anger millions of drivers and disrupt traffic in cities, with public transport not in a position to take up the slack.

Paz is a vice president and head of Bezeq's business division.
Handler was arrested last week in connection with an investigation into allegations that include fraud, bribery and securities offences. She was released from police custody to house arrest on Monday until March 4 while a court ordered she stay away from Bezeq for 30 days.
Bezeq's board is expected to decide on the interim appointment at a special board meeting later on Tuesday.
Along with Handler, Bezeq's controlling shareholder and former chairman Shaul Elovitch and a number of other officials connected to Bezeq were arrested. Most have been released from custody although Elovitch remains in detention.
They all deny any wrongdoing.
Elovitch said on Monday he would step down from the board as would his son and daughter-in-law, a step sought by minority shareholders in the wake of the investigation by Israel's markets regulator that began last year. 

Elovitch, a family friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, controls Bezeq through Eurocom Communications.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) and Virgin Money (L:VM) disclosed striking gender pay gaps on Tuesday, underlining an industry-wide chasm between male and female pay in Britain's financial sector. 
Ahead of an April deadline to report on gender pay, Asia-focused StanChart reported a gap of 30 percent in Britain, while Virgin Money - the only major UK lender run by a woman - said its female staff earned on average 32.5 percent less per hour than its male workforce. 
The two banks are the latest major financial institutions to reveal significant differences in average pay earned by male and female employees, which most firms have blamed on a dearth of high-flying female executives.
The pay gaps have drawn criticism from lawmakers and are likely to spur questions from investors in the upcoming season for shareholder meetings, with stock prices and future earnings potential strongly linked to efforts to draw a line under the sector's crisis-era image.
In its annual report, Virgin Money Chief Executive Jayne-Anne Ghadia said her bank had made progress against a target to have a 50:50 gender balanced workforce by 2020 and that female representation in senior management had improved to 29 percent by the end of 2017, up from 22 percent a year earlier.
But it conceded that men continued to dominate its executive committee and senior management team, accounting for 68 percent and 71 percent respectively.
Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) also said a lack of women in senior roles had skewed their average pay levels, after reporting similar gender pay gaps of 32.8 percent and 37 percent respectively on Friday.
With just HSBC (L:HSBA) still to release data on its gender pay gap,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) appears to have the biggest task among the major UK lenders to bring male and female pay closer together.
It said it paid women in its international division, which houses its investment bank, on average 48 percent of what men earned in fixed pay, while the mean gender pay gap for bonuses was 79 percent, due to fewer female employees in better paid, senior roles.

A spokeswoman for HSBC earlier told Reuters the bank would comply with the April deadline on disclosure but declined to give a timeline on publication.

1114,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","Starbucks opens first Reserve store, sees retail rents easing","By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) on Tuesday will open the first of 1,000 planned upscale Starbucks Reserve stores as part of a broad strategy to defend against high-end coffee rivals like Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea and Blue Bottle Coffee Co (S:NESN).
Starbucks for the first time in 2017 had more U.S. outlets than McDonald's Corp (N:MCD). The world's biggest coffee chain reached that milestone as competition from high- and low-end rivals mounted, and its own cooling traffic trends sparked worries that it was opening too many stores.
The new Reserve store is located in Starbucks' Seattle headquarters building and will expand on the company's showcase Seattle Reserve Roastery drink menu with new items such as nitro draft lattes. It also will serve food from Princi Italian bakery and alcoholic drinks from a ""mixology"" bar.
Starbucks co-founder and Executive Chairman Howard Schultz, who stepped down as chief executive in April to oversee the chain's ultra-premium Roastery and Reserve projects, said the new project will help ""re-define customer connection and continue to serve as a halo to the rest of the business.""
In a memo to employees on Sunday, Schultz said he has seen an ""abundance of empty store fronts across the country"" in prime locations and predicted that rents would begin to fall due to the continued shift from brick-and-mortar stores to online shopping.
""This is GOOD NEWS for Starbucks and the future of our unit economics,"" Schultz said in the memo. ""This is not going to be a cyclical change in our occupancy expenses, but a permanent lowering of the cost of our real estate.""
Starbucks has been opening about 700 traditional U.S. cafes per year. It has long-term plans to open up to 30 Reserve Roastery emporiums, 1,000 Reserve stores and to install Reserve bars at 20 percent of its mainstay stores.
It also plans to open stand-alone Princi stores in Seattle, Chicago and New York. In 2016, Starbucks made a financial investment in Princi and struck a global licensing deal with the Milan, Italy-based artisanal bakery.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. cable giant Comcast (O:CMCSA) has offered $31 billion for Sky (L:SKYB), threatening a plan hatched by Rupert Murdoch's Fox and Bob Iger's Walt  Disney  to seize control of Europe's biggest pay-TV group.
The world's biggest entertainment company and owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, said on Tuesday it had proposed to offer 12.50 pounds per share for Britain's Sky, significantly more than the 10.75 pounds Fox (O:FOXA) has agreed to pay for it.
Disney has agreed to buy Sky from 21st Century Fox, along with other assets, in a separate $52 billion follow-up deal.
Comcast's all-cash, unsolicited offer pits CEO Brian Roberts against Murdoch, the 86-year-old tycoon who helped to launch Sky and pioneer pay-TV in Britain. Iger is also a long time rival after Comcast tried and failed to buy Disney (N:DIS) in 2004.
""Sky and Comcast are a perfect fit: we are both leaders in creating and distributing content,"" Comcast Chief Executive Roberts said, sending Sky's shares up as much as 21 percent to 13.34 pounds and indicating that investors expect a bidding war. 
Comcast's appearance in the already complex Sky drama could prompt a higher Fox offer, Disney making its own direct bid for Sky or Comcast emerging as the unexpected victor. 
Media owners have been forced into increasingly aggressive deals after online groups Netflix Inc (O:NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc. (O:AMZN) prompted many customers to ditch subscriptions. 
Comcast bid $60 billion last year to clinch a deal with Murdoch's Fox, before losing out to Disney. 
Sky, which provides sports programming, films and broadband to 23 million homes across Britain, Ireland, Germany, Italy and Austria, urged its investors to take no action since the approach did not represent a firm offer. 
Murdoch's Fox agreed to buy the 61 percent of Sky it did not already own in a cash deal in December 2016, but the takeover has been repeatedly held up by regulators over concerns the media tycoon wields too much influence in Britain.
The shares had been trading above the asking price since Sky this month agreed to pay less than expected for Premier League soccer rights, boosting its future earnings and prompting investors to demand a higher offer.
It also attracted the attention of U.S. hedge fund and activist investor Elliott, which has built up a 2.5 percent stake in Sky in recent weeks. 
Hedge fund manager Crispin Odey, a former son-in-law of Murdoch who holds 1 percent of Sky, said he expected a counter offer and speculated whether Disney could make a direct bid for Sky to avoid Fox's regulatory problems.
""Once you're in a bidding war, it's not about fair value, it's about what do you think it's worth,"" Odey added. 
""LET BATTLE COMMENCE"" 
Formed in 1990, Sky has built its business by offering leading content and technology. It snapped up Murdoch's pay-TV groups across Europe in 2014 to offer a distribution platform that is now proving attractive to the big U.S. content owners. 
Comcast said it had not yet engaged with Sky over the proposal and its finance director, Michael Cavanagh, declined to comment on whether it could lead to a renewed bid for Fox. 
Comcast will have to gain the support of Sky's independent directors if it does not make a hostile bid because its chairman is Murdoch's son James, who is also CEO of 21st Century Fox.
Brian Roberts, the son of Ralph who founded Comcast in 1963, called Sky's Deputy Chairman Martin Gilbert on Tuesday morning to notify him just before the offer statement was released, and called Sky Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch shortly afterwards.
Sky's independent directors are expected to meet in the coming days to discuss the offer and the company said they were mindful of their duties to investors.
Comcast went public with the proposal to trigger the regulatory timetable because timing will be a key factor.
A Comcast spokesman said it would ask regulators in Brussels to look at the deal where it expects to avoid a full lengthy investigation. Britain's media minister has said he will give his verdict on Fox's bid for Sky by June 14, giving Comcast a narrow window to get any takeover approval done. 
""We would like to own the whole of Sky and we will be looking to acquire over 50 percent of the Sky shares,"" Roberts said.
Disney's Iger declined to comment when asked about the Comcast offer during a trip to Paris. 
MURDOCH TO LEAD THE CHARGE?
Murdoch had been edging toward a deal for Sky in recent weeks, eight years after he first tried to buy the company.
Britain's competition regulator said in January his planned takeover should be blocked unless a way was found to prevent the Australian-born power-broker from influencing Sky's news operation.
Critics, including many politicians, argue Murdoch wields too much influence through the Sun and Times newspapers, and in 2011 he closed the News of the World after its journalists admitted hacking phones to get scoops. 
Seeking to prove it would not influence Sky News in the future, Fox last week promised to maintain and fund a fully independent Sky-branded news service for 10 years.
Prime Minister Theresa May's ministers have appeared wary of approving Murdoch's bid, repeatedly asking the independent regulator to intervene, and Comcast could face a smoother ride.
A spokesman for May said the deal was a commercial matter.

Robey Warshaw, a small boutique firm which has worked on some of Britain's biggest deals, Evercore (N:EVR) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC) are advising Comcast.

DZ Bank also said that its group pretax profit fell to 1.8 billion euros from 2.2 billion a year earlier as the lender took a hit from DVB's provisions. Net profit shrank to 1.1 billion from 1.6 billion euros.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, doubled its return on investment in 2017, beating its benchmark, as strong global stock markets boosted the value of the portfolio, it said on Tuesday.
The fund earned a return of 13.7 percent in 2017, up from 6.9 percent in 2016.
""The fund's cumulative return since inception has passed 4,000 billion Norwegian crowns ($511 billion). One out of four crowns of return was generated in 2017, after a very strong year for the fund,"" CEO Yngve Slyngstad said in a statement.
""Again, our equity investments returned strongest with a return close to 20 percent.""
The fund invests the proceeds from Norway's oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad.
It is one of the world's largest shareholders, with investments in around 9,100 companies worldwide, equivalent to 1.4 percent of listed companies globally.
The fund's biggest single company investment at the end of 2017 was in Apple Inc (O:AAPL), worth 66 billion crowns, ahead of Nestle (S:NESN) at 51 billion and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) at 50 billion.
Apple was also the biggest single contributor to the fund's returns in 2017, ahead of Chinese tech group Tencent Holdings (HK:0700) and Microsoft (O:MSFT).
The fund's size is equivalent to $200,000 for every Norwegian man, woman and child.
The government withdrew 61 billion Norwegian crowns during 2017 to pay for public expenses, compared with 101 billion crowns in 2016.
CEO Yngve Slyngstad earned an annual salary of 6.7 million crowns. His chief investment officer for equity strategies, Petter Johnsen, earned more, with 7.4 million crowns. By comparison, the country's prime minister, Erna Solberg, earned 1.6 million crowns.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England will not ""go soft"" on enforcing European Union capital rules for insurers, although it will look at ways to make it easier for new entrants to boost competition in the industry, its deputy governor Sam Woods said on Tuesday.
The BoE's  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Regulation Authority, which Woods also heads, is consulting on how to ease the burden of the EU's Solvency II rules, which insurers say are overly burdensome.
British lawmakers have heavily criticized the BoE for not easing up on EU capital rules, which in some cases are forcing business to shift overseas to avoid heavy capital charges.
Woods said he was willing to make some changes, but would not be rushed into making any big alterations.
""We can tell the difference between feedback about a genuine technical flaw and generalized lobbying for lighter-touch regulation,"" Woods told the annual conference of the Association of British Insurers.
And the industry should not lose sight of the policyholder, who has been saddled with past failures like Equitable Life.
There is ""no convincing evidence"" to show that the EU rules had crushed profitability or growth of British insurers, or driven up premiums for policyholders, Wood said, although implementation of the directive could work better.
The PRA is exploring how to make it easier for new insurers to get a license in a bid to boost competition, he said.
Woods was emphasizing how the PRA could change the way it enforces some of the Solvency II rules, rather than changing the rules themselves, a step that could trigger opposition from other regulators in the bloc.
Britain is leaving the EU next year, with trading terms uncertain for financial firms who may have to rely on a system of ""equivalence"" for access to the bloc's market.

Actually changing the substance of EU rules could make it harder for Britain to argue equivalence, an insurance regulator from elsewhere in the EU told Reuters.

Linkway Trading was a project management company in the Gupta-owned Oakbay Group. The Gupta brothers have been accused of using their links with Zuma to get lucrative tenders and influence cabinet appointment.
The Guptas and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing.
KPMG has previously refuted allegations that it was involved in, or condoned, any alleged money laundering activities linked to Linkway Trading.
""The disciplinary advisory committee resolved that the registered auditor must be referred to a disciplinary hearing,"" said Bernard Agulhas, IRBA's chief executive, in response to questions from Reuters.
He said hearing preparations were underway and that possible dates would be set down in due course.
Agulhas said in terms of South Africa's Auditing Professions Act, KPMG could face sanctions ranging from a light caution or reprimand to the severest punishment, being struck from the register of auditors.
KPMG is one of several high-profile international companies facing questions about its work for the Indian-born Gupta brothers. 

A number of companies, including the African arm of German insurer Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) and local ones such as  Sasfin  (J:SFNJ) and Hulisani (J:HULJ), said last year they would drop KPMG as their auditor.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.1 percent by 0833 GMT, while the UK's FTSE 100 (FTSE) rose 0.3 percent. 
Shares in Sky jumped more than 18 percent on the back of Comcast's (O:CMCSA) $31 billion offer, which could scupper Fox's (O:FOXA) plan to buy out Sky and sell it to Walt  Disney  (N:DIS). 
Sky shares were trading well above Comcast's offer price, suggesting some investors expect Fox/Disney to come back with a higher offer. 
Europe's media index (SXMP) was the top-performing sector, up 1.7 percent at a one-month high. Shares in British broadcaster and content producer  ITV  (L:ITV) rose 2.3 percent.
Results were once again in focus, with UK housebuilder Persimmon (L:PSON) advancing 12 percent after it reported a jump in full-year earnings and a higher reservations rate and boosted its interim dividend. 
The results fired up the whole sector, with Berkeley up 2.9 percent and  Taylor Wimpey  (LON:TW) climbing 2.8 percent. 
Outside of the STOXX, troubled subprime lender  Provident Financial  (L:PFG) saw its shares soar 37 percent after saying it would raise 331 million pounds via a rights issue.
The broader stocks performance was more muted, however, ahead of testimony from the new U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell later in the day - watched for clues about future rate hikes and his view on recent market volatility.
Concerns over rising inflation and higher bond yields sparked a global equity market sell-off at the beginning of February, but as bond yields have eased this has taken the pressure off equity indexes slightly.

1140,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 12:44PM ET</span>",Supreme Court wrestles with Microsoft data privacy fight,"By Lawrence Hurley and Dustin Volz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Supreme Court justices on Tuesday wrestled with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corp's dispute with the U.S. Justice Department over whether prosecutors can force technology companies to hand over data stored overseas, with some signaling support for the government and others urging Congress to pass a law to resolve the issue.
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito, both conservatives, hinted during an hour-long argument in the case at support for the Justice Department's stance that because Microsoft is based in the United States it was obligated to turn over data sought by prosecutors in a U.S. warrant.
As the nine justices grappled with the technological complexities of email data storage, liberals Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor questioned whether the court needed to act in the data privacy case in light of Congress now considering bipartisan legislation that would resolve the legal issue.
A ruling is due by the end of June.
""Wouldn't it be wiser to say let's leave things as they are. If Congress wants to regulate this 'Brave New World,' let them do it,"" Ginsburg said.
Alito agreed that Congress should act but added that ""in the interim, something's got to be done.""
Roberts appeared concerned that companies like Microsoft could enable customers to evade the reach of U.S. prosecutors by deliberately storing data overseas.
The case pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in protecting customer data against the demands of law enforcement in gaining information vital to criminal and counterterrorism investigations. 
It started with a 2013 warrant obtained by U.S. prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. Microsoft challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said prosecutors were entitled to the data because Microsoft is headquartered in the United States.
The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 sided with Microsoft, handing a victory to tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump's administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.
The appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.
Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the 1986 statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican who has led the efforts to rework the law, was in the courtroom to hear Tuesday's argument, and afterward noted that various justices had referred to the importance of Congress acting.
""Our bill, the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data (CLOUD) Act, would resolve the question currently before the Court in a way that balances consumer, law enforcement, and privacy interests. This commonsense legislation has the full-throated support of both law enforcement and the tech community and deserves swift enactment,"" Hatch said in a statement afterward.
Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government's reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.
Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.
The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.
Other companies including  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google filed court papers backing Microsoft.

The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont.

(Reuters) - Two products designed to expose investors to market swings may become less turbulent.
ProShare Capital Management LLC, sponsor of two of the world's largest products betting on the cost of insurance against market swings, is toning down its investment strategy.
The changes to funds tied to Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" the CBOE Volatility Index, come three weeks after some volatility-linked products sank by more than 90 percent over a day following a market selloff earlier this month.
One of the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) taking losses, $797 million ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, is halving its mandate.
The fund typically profits in stable markets, but can sink when stocks fall. The depths of its losses after equity markets closed on Feb. 5 shocked some investors; others said the risks were disclosed. The market action is now being probed by securities regulators.
SVXY will, from close of business on Tuesday, be designed to go up 1 percent when the index it tracks declines by 2 percent, ProShare said. Previously, the ratio was negative one-to-one.
A companion product, $342 million ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF, will aim to gain 1.5 percent, instead of 2 percent, when the index it tracks increases by 1 percent.
The announced dilutions come three days after another company, REX Shares LLC, tamed its own volatility-linked products.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG earlier this month withdrew its VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Note, which followed a similar strategy, from the market.
The changes respond to concerns that these volatility products' hunger for VIX futures exhausted the market's liquidity on Feb. 5, pushing prices up and exacerbating losses for traders betting on those contracts falling in value. SVXY sank 83 percent from Feb. 5 to 6, while XIV fell 93 percent.
A ProShare spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on why the changes were made.
The adjustments may not be voluntary. In addition to the attention of regulators, ProShare faces pressure from the major banks that act as its brokers.
Those brokers slashed the amount of futures the funds could obtain from them and also hiked the deposits the funds had to pay in order to buy futures, ProShare disclosed in an offering document filed earlier this month with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, saying the changes could make it more difficult for the funds to operate.

1143,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Company owned by jeweler at heart of India bank fraud case files for bankruptcy,"By Sudarshan Varadhan and Abhirup Roy
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - A company owned by Nirav Modi, the billionaire jeweler at the heart of a $2 billion fraud case in India, has filed for bankruptcy in a New York court, as investigators stepped up their investigation into a case that has stunned the country.
The U.S. bankruptcy filing by Firestar Diamond Inc comes as investigations by Indian authorities into the fraud case are becoming more aggressive, including a raid last week of Modi's former law firm that lawyers described as unprecedented. 
Modi, along with his uncle Mehul Choksi, owner of  Gitanjali Gems  Ltd (NS:GTGM), are suspected to have colluded with bank officials at  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) (NS:PNBK) to obtain unauthorized loans over a six-year period. 
PNB late on Monday said the amount of those fraudulent transactions could rise by $204 million to nearly $2 billion, sending its shares reeling to a 20-month low.
The scale of the fraud has raised concerns about the potential for similar cases across India's banking sector. India's Finance Ministry on Tuesday set a 15-day deadline for state banks to take action to improve their oversight of operational and technological risks. 
The ministry's Department of Financial Services also ordered state-run lenders to comb through their bad loans of more than 500 million rupees ($7.71 million) for potential fraud.
Among the actions lenders must take include identifying current oversight weaknesses and having banks' boards ""assign clear accountability"" for implementation and compliance.
Analysts said the government directive could hit banks in the short-term if more fraud was detected, though it would benefit the sector in the long-term.
""The oversight in the banking system is obviously not good,"" said Yuvraj Choudhary, an analyst at brokerage Anand Rathi. ""This could lead to uncovering of more potential scams. We can expect bottom-lines to be hit in the coming quarters.""
LAW FIRM RAIDED 
Firestar Diamond Inc listed $50 million to $100 million in assets and liabilities and noted it had 50 to 99 creditors, according to a court filing in the Southern District Of New York on late Monday.
The company is a unit of Firestar International, controlled by Modi, a jeweler who built his range of international diamond businesses in part by drawing a famous roster of clients such as actress Kate Winslet. His flagship Firestar International had $2.3 billion in sales as of March 2017, according to figures previously provided by the company.
Indian authorities have stepped up investigations into potential wrongdoing at PNB as well as companies tied to Modi and Choksi, although no charges have yet been filed.
An official at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said the country's federal police had last week raided the offices of law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, which had represented Modi for a while, and taken away documents related to the Indian jeweler. He did not give additional details.
Lawyers said they were unclear what legal basis the CBI had used to seize the documents.
Cyril Amarchand did not respond to a request for comment.
Meanwhile, the CBI source added current and former officials at PNB continued to be questioned, including former managing director Usha Ananthasubramanian, who now heads state-run  Allahabad Bank  (NS:ALBK), as well as officials from other lenders that lent to companies tied to Mehul Choksi and auditors.
Ananthasubramanian did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
At least a dozen people - six from the bank and six more from Modi's and Choksi's companies - have been arrested, while investigators have seized a number of properties from the two, including jewelry and luxury vehicles.
Both Modi and Choksi, whose whereabouts are unknown, have said they are innocent.
BANKING SHARES REEL
PNB's disclosure it had detected additional fraudulent loans, on top of the $1.77 billion reported in a disclosure earlier this month, sent shares of state-run lenders sharply lower on Tuesday, reinforcing concerns about the escalating financial cost of the unauthorized loans steered toward the two Indian jewelers. 
The government's orders for tougher supervision is also raising concerns that Indian lenders, already struggling to clean up a record $147 billion in bad debt, will face additional regulatory scrutiny and scepticism from investors about the scale of the fraud problems across the sector.
PNB shares slumped 12.2 percent, after earlier falling as much as 14.2 percent to its lowest since June 2016.

1144,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 10:40PM ET</span>","American Airlines, Qantas re-seek U.S. nod for joint venture","SYDNEY (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) are making a second attempt at gaining U.S. regulatory permission for a venture that would allow them to coordinate prices and schedules, threatening to cancel services if they are rejected.
The pair's application for a joint venture covering the United States, Australia and New Zealand was rejected in 2016 under the Obama administration amid opposition from rival carriers Hawaiian Airlines Inc and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU).
The airlines have said they hope the new administration will look more favorably on an application as President Donald Trump has promised to boost U.S. industry through lighter regulation and a more hands-off approach to anti-trust enforcement.
""The proposed joint business will significantly improve service, stimulate demand and unlock more than $300 million annually in consumer benefits that are not achievable through any other form of cooperation,"" Qantas said in a statement on Tuesday.
The statement added that a rejection could result in Qantas reducing the frequency of, downgrading or even cancelling its A380 service between Sydney and Dallas/Fort Worth, while American may further reduce services between Los Angeles and Sydney and Auckland.
American Airlines and Qantas currently rely on codeshare agreements to make those routes economically viable. If the venture is approved, the two could offer more flights, including to cities not currently served by either.
Regulators in Australia and New Zealand had approved the first application for the joint venture before it was rejected by the United States.

The offer comes less than a month after struggling radio station owner iHeart skipped a $106 million interest payment, triggering a 30-day grace period to buy more time to restructure its $20 billion debt and avoid bankruptcy.
If iHeart does not reach a deal with creditors by the end of this period and still does not make the payment, the creditors can call their debt due immediately, potentially pushing the company into bankruptcy.
Monday's proposal, which was made public via a term sheet issued to certain lenders and noteholders of iHeart, is intended to comply with existing restructuring support agreement discussions. (http://prn.to/2ospIR0)
Liberty is willing to finance working capital needs once iHeart has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy through a debtor-in-possession financing facility, according to the document.

In return, Liberty will receive 40 percent of the new shares of the company along with its majority held subsidiary Sirius XM Holdings Inc (O:SIRI).

1147,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 06:01PM ET</span>",Top Noble Group Holder Attacks `Shocking' Loss as Dispute Flares,"(Bloomberg) -- One of Noble Group Ltd.’s top shareholders has stepped up its criticism of the commodity trader, describing expected losses as “shocking” and warning that the billions in red ink may pile more pressure on investors to agree to a debt-for-equity rescue plan.
The net losses will “erode what little cash Noble has left, and puts further pressure on stakeholders to accept the restructuring proposal,” Goldilocks Investment Co. said in a statement on Tuesday, referring to more writedowns on derivatives contracts as well as fourth-quarter losses on its core business. “These figures are extremely shocking.”
Noble Group, which is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday, warned last week it will post a loss for the final three months of last year, bringing its expected loss for 2017 to almost $5 billion. While the Hong Kong-based company is seeking to get investors to agree to the rescue plan, which will hand control of the group to creditors and give management a holding of up to 20 percent, Goldilocks is leading opposition to the proposal.
“The profit warning indicates that Noble’s remaining core business is still hemorrhaging cash,” the Abu Dhabi-based group said. “We urge all stakeholders -- shareholders and creditors -- to join Goldilocks in opposing the proposed restructuring and work together for a more equitable and meaningful turnaround for all.”
Under the plan, which has been backed by some creditors, a proposed agreement will see about half of the company’s $3.5 billion in debt, including bonds, switched into new equity, with perpetual bondholders offered a few cents on the dollar. All existing shareholders will get a 10 percent stake. Goldilocks has complained of “massive dilution”."

Low-cost carrier JetBlue has previously said it is weighing whether to replace its fleet of about 60, 100-seater E-190 jets, in a campaign pitting Bombardier's CSeries against its Brazilian rival's latest model, the E190-E2.
JetBlue officials also met Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare at the company's Montreal-area plant on Monday, said an industry source, confirming earlier media reports. The source said JetBlue had not finalized a deal with either planemaker. 
A spokeswoman for Bombardier declined to comment on a sales campaign.
JetBlue said in a statement it is ""exploring a full range of options from maintaining the current fleet to a full replacement with an alternative aircraft type."" 
Embraer is determined to keep JetBlue as a key customer, while Bombardier wants to grow sales in the United States after a trade agency ruled the Canadian plane-and-train-maker could sell its 110-to-130 seat CSeries to American carriers duty-free following a dispute with  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
The Feb. 17 email says ""the Bombardier team was in to discuss product support and maintenance for its C Series. And later this month, we’ll have a chance to take a close-up look at the Embraer E2."" 
It was not clear whether JetBlue already saw the E2 and a spokesman for Embraer could not immediately answer Monday night.
In January, JetBlue said it would prolong an internal review over the future of its fleet at a time of an evolving landscape for commercial aviation. Embraer is now holding tie-up talks with Boeing and Bombardier is working to complete a deal giving a majority stake in the CSeries to Airbus SE (PA:AIR).

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 04:29AM ET</span>",World stocks hit three-week highs before new Fed chief's debut,"By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks rose to three-week highs on Tuesday, helped by a decline in borrowing costs ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's first testimony before the United States Congress later in the day.
The MSCI All-Country World Index, was up 0.1 percent and set for its third straight day of gains after hitting its highest level since Feb. 5. Though the index remains down over 2 percent for February, it has recovered more than two thirds of the losses sustained in the wake of a drastic selloff early this month.
After gains in opening deals, European shares turned red, with the pan-European STOXX 600 down 0.1 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 was up 0.1 percent. 
Japan's Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to three-week highs while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan also hit a three-week high before giving up gains on profit-taking in Chinese shares.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 advanced 1.18 percent on Monday helped by a fall in U.S. bond yields. (N)
The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield eased to 2.866 percent, dropping further from its four-year peak of 2.957 percent touched on Feb. 21, driven by month-end buying as well as position adjustments ahead of Powell's testimony.
Powell's debut appearance is seen as critical for financial markets at a time when many investors are nervous about the Fed's policy normalization following years of stimulus after the financial crisis almost a decade ago.
Many investors expect the Fed to raise interest rates three times this year, with some pundits predicting four, if U.S. inflation starts to take off, especially as growth is set to get another boost from the Trump administration's tax cuts and spending plans. 
Yet, there are worries higher dollar bond yields could prompt investors to shift funds to bonds from riskier assets, especially when the valuation of the world's stocks are quite expensive even after their sell-off earlier this month.
The two-year U.S. Treasuries yield was 2.226 percent, well above the dividend yield of the S&P 500, which stood at 1.88 percent.
A rise in dollar interest rates could also bode ill for potential borrowers, including U.S. home buyers and many companies that have expanded borrowing for years to take advantage of low dollar funding costs.
""The market is a little bit cautious ahead of this speech, but we think he (Powell) is likely to stress the continuity of monetary policy...because it wouldn't be in his interest to have any major market reactions - that would make his job more difficult,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) currency strategist Anje Praefcke.
""What he's likely to state is what we've seen in the FOMC (Federal Open Markets Committee) minutes: that the outlook for the U.S. economy has improved considerably, short-term, and that both wages and consumer price inflation have recently surprised on the upside.""
Against a basket of currencies, the dollar traded 0.1 percent lower.
Elsewhere in currencies, the euro traded at $1.2334, up 0.1 percent, but off its three-year high of $1.2556 hit earlier this month. 
Fed funds rate futures <0#FF:> were almost fully pricing in a rate hike at the Fed's next policy meeting on March 20-21.
""Expectations that Powell will be sensitive to financial markets appear to be running high. But he hasn't said he will sacrifice policy normalization for the sake of financial markets. I feel there is room for disappointment in markets,"" said Hiroko Iwaki, senior bond strategist at Mizuho Securities.
Oil prices erased earlier gains as investor concerns about rising U.S. oil output offset signs of stronger demand and faith in the ability of OPEC production curbs to curtail supply. [O/R]
U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures fetched $63.68, down 0.3 percent, after hitting a three-week high of $64.24 the previous day.
London Brent crude traded 0.2 percent lower at $67.34 a barrel, after hitting a three-week high of $67.90 the previous day.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 27, 2018 12:42AM ET</span>",GM Korea sees 'positive signal' as union talks to resume this week,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors' (N:GM) South Korean unit said it plans to resume wage talks with its labor union on Wednesday, earlier than expected, as it tries to cut costs at the loss-making operations and keep its factories open. 
Wage negotiations were suspended this month after GM said it would shut one of its factories in South Korea and decide the fate of the three remaining plants in the coming weeks - a decision that will depend on the concessions it can wrangle from the unions and the amount of government support it can secure.
The resumption of talks underscores the intensifying pressure on the unit's labor union to make concessions to prevent GM's exit from the country, where it employs 16,000 people.
The union, which has been holding protest rallies, had previously asserted that talks were unlikely to resume before mid-March unless its demands were met.
""The union is unlikely to go militant. If they don't make concessions, this could put other factories at risk,"" said Lee Hang-koo, a senior research fellow at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade.
GM is proposing a base wage freeze and no bonuses this year along with a suspension of some benefits such as tuition for employees' children and gold medals for long-serving workers.
""We hope to make meaningful progress in future negotiations with our labor union ... We see this as a positive signal,"" a GM Korea spokesman said of the resumption of talks.
GM has said its discussions with the union and the government must demonstrate significant progress by the end of February, when GM will make important decisions on its next steps.
Over the past week, the union has come under intense pressure from South Korean conservative media to make wage concessions.
""The conservative media are putting us in corner. We can't just stand still,"" a union official told Reuters. The union, however, plans to continue to hold rallies later on Tuesday and on Wednesday. 
GM executives and conservative opposition lawmakers contend South Korea's relatively high wages and unyielding unions have contributed to the U.S. automaker's problems in the country.
But the ruling party's senior vice policy chief, Hong Ihkpyo, lashed back. ""The labor union should share the pain, but GM Korea's latest problems stem from GM's failed global management,"" he said in a radio interview.
GM Korea and its South Korean shareholder Korea Development Bank (KDB) have agreed to appoint a third-party accounting firm to conduct due diligence on GM Korea before a decision on government support is made. 

KDB Chairman Lee Dong-geol told a parliamentary committee on Tuesday that the state-run bank would take legal action against GM if any irregularities were found during the process.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 07:20PM ET</span>",Cuban cigar sales hit record as China demand surges,"By Sarah Marsh
HAVANA (Reuters) - A surge in sales of Cuba's legendary cigars in China helped manufacturer Habanos S.A.'s global revenue rise 12 percent to hit a record of around $500 million last year, the company said on Monday at the start of Cuba's annual cigar festival.
Habanos S.A., a 50-50 joint venture between the Cuban state and Britain's Imperial Brands Plc (L:IMB), said sales in China, its third export market after Spain and France, jumped 33 percent in value in 2017.
""Without doubt, there is potential for China to become the biggest market at a global level,"" Habanos Vice President of Development Jose María Lopez told Reuters after the company's annual news conference, while puffing on a smoke.
The Cuban monopoly cigar company's hand-rolled cigars, which include brands such as Cohiba, Montecristo and Partagas, are considered by many as the best in the world, and the festival attracts wealthy tobacco aficionados and retailers from all over for a week of extravagant parties and tours of plantations and factories.
Lopez said that growth in global sales of Cuban cigars last year outpaced the luxury goods market, which expanded 5 percent, according to consultancy Bain & Co. He put sales growth down to several good tobacco harvests and new products.
The Habanos executive said the outlook was also positive, given solid demand and ""excellent"" climatic conditions. Hurricane Irma, which wrought havoc throughout much of Cuba last year, left the western, prime tobacco-growing state of Pinar del Rio mostly unscathed.
Cigars are one of the top exports for the Cuban economy, which is otherwise struggling with decreasing aid from key ally Venezuela, a cash crunch and a pushback against market reforms.
However, the Caribbean island cannot sell its signature export to the biggest market worldwide for cigars, the United States, due to the decades-old U.S. trade embargo.
Improved U.S.-Cuba relations under former U.S. President Barack Obama stoked a boom in international travel to Cuba and boosted cigar sales on the island, with American visitors able to take home as many cigars as they wanted. 
Lopez said U.S. President Donald Trump's more hostile policy toward Cuba, including tighter restrictions on U.S. travel, did not appear to have impacted sales so far. Domestic revenue rose around 15 percent last year.
""We trust that despite Trump's measures the Cuban market will continue to grow in 2018,"" he said. 
Cigars have been Cuba's signature product ever since Christopher Columbus saw natives smoking rolled up tobacco leaves when he first sailed to the Caribbean island in 1492.

Late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro was often seen puffing on his favored kind, the long and thin 'lancero', until he quit in 1985.

1. Powell To Set The Pace?
Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell is slated to testify before the House and Senate Tuesday. While some market participants suggested that Powell would be reluctant to adopt a more hawkish stance than that of his predecessor Janet Yellen, others cited the central bank’s recent upbeat language on inflation as preparation for a more hawkish approach to monetary policy.
Nonetheless, investors are likely to closely parse Fed chair Powell’s comments on signs of rising inflation for clues on the pace of interest rate hikes.
A pair of reports on durable goods and consumer confidence are expected to garner investor attention for signs of ongoing strength in the US economy.
Economist forecast the Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge to show a reading of 126.2 for February from 125.4 in the previous month.
The Commerce Department is expected to report core durable goods orders cooled to 0.4% in January, from 0.7% in the prior month.
The dollar struggled for direction against basket of major currencies trading around the flatline throughout the session.

Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude stockpiles fell by 907,000 barrels for the week ended Feb. 16.
Crude oil futures settled higher on Monday as investors cheered upbeat commentary on continued output cuts from Saudi Arabia.

1177,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>",Powell Heads to Congress as Fed Faces Riskier Post-Yellen World,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s embrace of his predecessor’s gradual approach to tightening monetary policy is about to be tested.
Since Powell accepted President Donald Trump’s nomination almost four months ago, the near-term outlook has changed significantly.
Financial volatility has awakened, and a booming stock market has shown it can also go down. A $1.5 trillion tax package is adding stimulus to the U.S. economy at a time of very low unemployment and solid growth, a trend that could red-line demand and kick up a central banker’s worst enemy -- inflation. The government wants to test the limits of the world’s appetite for its debt, a boost in supply that’s putting upward pressure on market interest rates.
For Powell, who delivers his first congressional testimony as Fed chairman on Tuesday, there’s suddenly a lot more political and economic risks testing the new leader from the outset.
“In this environment, you will have more combativeness between fiscal and monetary policy,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. “Debt-financed fiscal stimulus is hitting the accelerator on growth at the very moment the Fed was attempting to tap on the brakes.”
Former Fed Chair Janet Yellen pursued a policy of ultra-patience, letting the economy work through headwinds of tight credit and weak confidence. She raised benchmark lending rate just five times over her four-year tenure. She also exploited a period of low inflation to test the limits of labor market slack.
Three vs Four
The margin Powell faces to continue to run the economy hot is slimmer. The unemployment rate was 4.1 percent last month and forecasters expect it to drop into the 3s this year. The debate inside the Fed will intensify over the pace of tightening. Policy makers penciled in three hikes in December, but just a few weeks later they boosted their outlook for growth, according to minutes from the January Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
FOMC participants “anticipated that the rate of economic growth in 2018 would exceed their estimates of its sustainable longer-run pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further,” according to the minutes released Feb. 21.
Because his testimony is happening before the FOMC formally updates its forecast next month, Powell will have to manage the tension between an upgraded economic outlook and a policy path that is still stuck at three hikes from December, said former Fed Governor Laurence Meyer. Firms such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). and Meyer’s own policy analysis firm predict the central bank will hike four times this year.
“He has to say that the economy is stronger than expected, that fiscal stimulus is adding to that strength, and that unemployment will fall more than expected,” Meyer said. “The tension is that the policy guidance, including in the January minutes, seems out of date and out of line with the evolving outlook.”
Indeed, the forecast is more complicated and less certain. Nobody knows, for example, how high market interest rates have to go to attract buyers to fund the increase in government bond issuance. The question for Powell is how to respond to tighter financial conditions and some crowding out of private financing.
If nothing else was changing, the Fed could simply back off the pace of rate hikes for a while as higher financing costs offset fiscal stimulus. Tighter financial conditions would be welcomed.
But Congress is adding more demand at a time of the lowest unemployment since 2000, and with some measures of inflation forecast to move higher. The Fed cautioned in its Monetary Policy Report to Congress Friday that the labor market appeared “near or a little beyond” full employment.
No Fed chief wants to tangle with an administration’s spending plans. But it seems inevitable that Powell is on a collision course with deficit politics. “It puts him in a position of responding to fiscal stimulus,” said UBS economist Robert Martin, whose firm also predicts four hikes this year.
Another political minefield Powell must navigate is the degree to which he buys into the administration’s view that the Republican tax legislation will boost productivity, eventually offsetting the deficit to some extent with higher tax revenue. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg News in an interview Thursday that “you can have wage inflation and not necessarily have inflation concerns in general.”
For Powell, the biggest challenge in his first year may come down to communication in a time of rising uncertainty. At economic turning points, the committee is often divided, and because consensus is hard to achieve, fuzzy language often results. The Fed’s latest innovation is the word “further” in reference to additional rate increases, which could mean either some more or a lot more.
“The feature of turning points is that they are hard to identify and people disagree,” said Vincent Reinhart, a former Fed policy adviser who is now chief economist at BNY Mellon Asset Management. “How do you corral your colleagues so they tell a consistent story?”
People expecting any greater clarity from Powell on the policy path may be disappointed. He’s not an economist, but a private-sector financier who said in 2016 that “focusing too much on the precise timing of policy moves” may be adding to confusion.
Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP (LON:NXGN) LLC, said Powell will be wary of putting too much faith in any forecast. “Coming from the business world, you come to the monetary-policy exercise understanding that you live in an uncertain world,” he said."

Honeywell's forecast for the next five years represents a 5.3 percent to 10.5 percent increase over the 3,800 deliveries made between 2013 and 2017.
The company, which makes jet engines, said in its market forecast that its 2018 findings show purchase-plan rates for civil helicopters is consistent with its 2017 survey.
""Potential positive impacts of U.S. tax reform on new helicopter demand and lower volatility in oil and gas-related markets have helped fleet managers confirm what they told us last year,"" Ben Driggs, president, Americas, Honeywell Aerospace said in a statement.
The Morris Plains, New Jersey-based company expects the light single-engine helicopter models to be the most-desired product over the next five years as flying taxis as an option for urban commute is being considered by tech startups and companies. 
Earlier in February, Bell Helicopter, a unit of  Textron Inc  (N:TXT), said it tied up with ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] to bring the first air-taxis by 2025, Bloomberg had reported. [https://bloom.bg/2saBLXj]

Honeywell said it expects helicopter fleet utilization to increase significantly in North America but sees only a modest increase in Europe and Latin America over the next 12 months.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Apple (O:AAPL) rose 2 percent on Monday and were on the verge of a record high after billionaire Warren Buffett talked up his company's stake in the iPhone maker.
Apple's stock was at $179.04, just short of its $179.26 record closing price on Jan. 18 and shaking off a slide of more than 10 percent earlier this month following a lackluster quarterly report.
In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Buffett said his company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), had bought more Apple shares than any other stock over the past year. He also praised Apple's ability to retain customers in its iPhone ecosystem. (https://tinyurl.com/ycrfcfx6)
Berkshire Hathaway disclosed on Feb. 14 that it had increased its stake in Apple by 23 percent, making it the company's largest common stock investment.
Also on Monday, Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported Apple was planning this year to launch its largest-ever iPhone, along with two other smartphones. (https://bloom.bg/2HNO4wg)
Apple last year launched a 10th anniversary iPhone with premium features and a $1,000 price tag. But overall iPhone sales missed analysts' expectations in the December quarter, and the global smartphone market is struggling to grow.
New York-based investment management firm Inverness Counsel's money managers considered reducing clients' exposure to Apple following its quarterly report on Feb. 1, but ultimately decided not to make changes, said Chief Investment Strategist Tim Ghriskey.
""You still have a relatively inexpensive stock and an ecosystem that would be extremely hard to replicate,"" Ghriskey said. ""We concluded that Apple would come out with something and calm the market, and make investors look to the future.""

Since its quarterly report, nine analysts have raised their price targets for Apple, while six have reduced their targets. The median price target for Apple's stock has risen from $189.48 to $192.43. At that price, Apple's stock market value would be $989 billion, compared to $909 billion on Monday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visa (N:V) will on Tuesday try to fend off European Union antitrust charges that it subjects foreign tourists to excessive fees when they use their cards in the EU, people familiar with the matter said.
The world's largest payments network operator will present its case before senior European Commission officials and national competition officials at a two-day closed hearing, six months after charges were filed against the company. An adverse ruling could leave Visa subject to a hefty fine.
The EU competition enforcer said in August last year that fees charged to retailers when they accept Visa cards issued outside the EU could raise prices for consumer goods and services.
Such fees have long been a sore point with retailers, who see it as a hidden cost for consumers. The case is important for the EU, which wants to trim such costs and improve cross-border trade.
""We welcome the opportunity to meet with the European Commission to outline our position regarding inter-regional interchange fees,"" Visa spokesman Richard Braham said.
""Visa firmly believes that payment card transactions by international tourists are an important contributor to European economies.""
The Commission declined to comment.
Visa could face fines of up to 10 percent of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching EU antitrust rules.
MasterCard (N:MA), which will also attend Tuesday's hearing, faces similar charges by the Commission, and it has warned it might be subject to a fine in excess of $1 billion.
In July 2015, the Commission accused MasterCard of levying excessive fees on non-EU issued cards used in the bloc. It also charged that MasterCard rules prevented banks in one EU country from offering lower interchange fees to a retailer in a second EU country where interchange fees may be higher.
To end another EU investigation, Visa and MasterCard have capped cross-border fees within Europe - that is, fees on transactions in one EU country charged for transactions in another EU country.

Business lobbying group EuroCommerce, whose members include Swedish retailer Ikea [IKEA.UL], French supermarket chain  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) and Spanish clothing retailer  Inditex  (MC:ITX), will also take part in the event.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. drug company executive Martin Shkreli will be held responsible for $10.4 million in financial losses when he is sentenced for defrauding investors, a federal judge ruled on Monday, rejecting his argument that he did not cause any losses because his investors eventually came out ahead.
The ruling from U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto could mean more prison time for Shkreli, since the amount of financial loss plays a major role in federal sentencing guidelines. While Matsumoto must consider the guidelines at the sentencing, which is scheduled for March 9, she is not bound to follow them.
Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, said in an email that he was ""disappointed by the ruling but still hopeful that the court will find it in her heart to impose a reasonably lenient sentence.""
A spokesman for the prosecutors declined to comment.
Shkreli, 34, became famous as the ""Pharma Bro"" after raising the price of anti-infection drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015 while he was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. He was found guilty by a jury in August of unrelated securities fraud charges brought against him in December 2015.
Shkreli has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered a $5,000 bounty for a strand of Hillary Clinton's hair in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
He was convicted of lying to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he controlled, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, and of conspiring to manipulate the stock price of a pharmaceutical company he founded, Retrophin Inc (O:RTRX).
Prosecutors have not disputed that Shkreli's investors came out ahead after Shkreli paid them in shares of Retrophin, and in some cases through settlement agreements and consulting contracts with the company. Shkreli's lawyers argued that as a result, he should not be held responsible for financial loss.
Matsumoto said in Monday's order that under federal law, all of the money that investors put in Shkreli's funds as a result of his fraud, about $6.4 million, must be considered loss. She also said he should get no credit for paying investors back because he only did so after they became suspicious.

The judge said that Shkreli should be held responsible for about $4 million in intended loss to investors for trying to prop up the price of Retrophin shares by trying to stop a group of investors from selling them, even though he was not fully successful.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is preparing to release three new smartphones later this year, including the largest iPhone ever, a device that may have a bigger display than arch-rival Samsung's flagship phone, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the products.
The trio also includes an upgraded handset the same size as the current iPhone X and a less expensive model with some of the X's key features.
The new phones could revive the screen size wars of years past at a time when smartphone makers are straining to come up with new features to lure buyers in a saturated market. Global smartphone sales were down 0.1 percent last year, according to research firm IDC, with Apple and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd expanding shipments only 1.9 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively.
The iPhone maker is already running production tests with suppliers and is expected to announce the new phones this fall. However, the plans could still change, the report said. (https://bloom.bg/2HNO4wg)
Apple declined to comment. Its shares were up almost 2 percent at $178.95 in midday trade. Earlier in the day, billionaire Warren Buffett talked up his company's stake in the iPhone maker, which also helped boost shares. 
Bloomberg reported the largest iPhone could have a screen of close to 6.5 inches (16.5 cm), larger than the 6.2-inch (15.75 cm) Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus announced on Monday in Barcelona, Spain, and larger than the current Samsung Note 8's 6.3-inch screen. Samsung traditionally announces new Note series devices in the fall, so it is possible it might launch a larger screen around the same time Apple's new models hit the market.
But Bob O'Donnell, head of Technalysis Research, said the reported trio of new iPhones was ""a very logical extension of the product line"" for Apple: ""One bigger, one cheaper, and one upgrade to the existing iPhone X.""
The Cupertino-based company earlier this month forecast disappointing revenue of $60 billion to $62 billion for its fiscal second quarter ending in March, with a number of media reports pointing to slack demand for iPhone X after unit sales failed to meet expectations in the run-up to Christmas.
With global smartphone sales roughly flat, vendors are focusing on features designed to encourage consumers to ditch their old phones earlier than they would have previously.
""The whole nature of smartphone purchase decisions have changed,"" O'Donnell said. ""It's not about what is the newest, greatest model. It's about when is my phone so old I need to upgrade, and what's available when I need a new one.""
Samsung on Sunday unveiled its flagship Galaxy S9 smartphone with an emphasis on visual applications for social media, improved cameras, and an artificial intelligence-powered voice tool.
Bloomberg said the body of the larger phone will be about the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus, but the screen will be about an inch larger than 8 Plus's, thanks to edge-to-edge design. Apple also plans a gold-colored device to help boost sales in Asia, Bloomberg reported.
Apple is also preparing an update to the regular-sized iPhone X, Bloomberg said, adding that the phones are expected to use next-generation A12 processors and will continue to include stainless steel edges and will be Apple's high-end smartphone offerings.
What remains unclear is whether Apple will also cut any current iPhone models from its lineup. The company has kept older models like the iPhone SE - essentially an updated iPhone 5 - on shelves to an unprecedented degree, providing lower-priced offerings for developing markets like India.

Apple has also embraced the used iPhone market as a way to expand its share of smartphone users. When customers sell their old iPhone for a new one, the old iPhone “winds up with another customer somewhere else that is perfectly fine with having a previously owned iPhone,"" CEO Tim Cook told investors on an earnings call earlier this month.

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 01:18PM ET</span>",Supreme Court justices skeptical of American Express merchant fees,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Liberal U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday sharply questioned  American Express  (N:AXP) over restrictions the company places on merchants forbidding them from encouraging customers to use rival credit cards with lower fees, which several states and the Trump administration claim violate federal antitrust law. 
The high court heard about an hour of arguments in an appeal by the states, led by Ohio, of a 2016 ruling by lower court in New York that cleared American Express of stifling competition through its so-called anti-steering provisions in contracts with merchants. 
While liberal justices suggested the provisions could harm consumers, the court has a 5-4 conservative majority. Justice Neil Gorsuch was the only conservative whose questions appeared to show support for American Express.
Liberal Elena Kagan said that businesses, such as a local coffee shop, would be able to pass on lower fees to customers without the anti-steering measures. ""That sounds like a market that isn't working like it is supposed to,"" Kagan told the attorney for American Express, Evan Chesler.
The case could have major implications for American Express, whose business model is closely tied to the fees it charges to merchants for each transaction, which fund the benefits it offers its cardholders.
The legal issue centered on how courts find antitrust violations when businesses cater to two groups at the same time and limits on competition for one side might offer benefits for the other.
The two groups in this case are cardholders and merchants but the ruling would likely reverberate more widely because the dynamic is common in other industries, such as advertising and e-commerce.

American Express says its system has allowed it to compete against the dominant networks, Visa (N:V) and MasterCard (N:MA). The states, backed by the administration of President Donald Trump, argue that the anti-steering measures have blocked low-fee rival networks, raised fees for merchants, and inflated retail prices for everyone, including those who do not use credit cards.

BARCELONA/LONDON (Reuters) - The prospects of seeing a handful of telecoms giants take control of the European market as in China and the United States look remote as hopes for a new wave of large cross-border deals quickly run into cold reality.
Vodafone's (L:VOD) talks with Liberty Global (O:LBTYA) about buying some of the cable company's assets and a $6.7 billion bid led by Australia's Macquarie Infrastructure (N:MIC) for Danish telecoms company  TDC  (CO:TDC) have rekindled expectations for further mergers.
However, none of them look set to transform Europe's telecoms landscape -- a collection of national markets with typically three to four operators in each.
Tough anti-trust rules, wariness over politically-charged mergers involving former monopolies such as Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn), France's Orange (PA:ORAN),  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) or Spain's  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) and the investments needed to upgrade networks limit the appeal of the sector. 
""There is no catalyst for a mega-deal, investors don't see the synergies and see very well the integration risks of two traditional operators,"" said a senior French telecoms banker.
""The conditions are not yet met for these complicated deals to happen,"" he added. 
Orange's boss Stephane Richard dampened the idea that Europe's fourth-biggest telecoms operator could tie-up with bigger rival Deutsche Telekom last week after a source confirmed in January that merger talks between the two fizzled last year.
""There is no hidden project. There is no hidden negotiation with anybody, neither with the Germans nor… with anybody else,"" he said. 
""There is no project today that make sense in terms of value creation, in terms of political feasibility, in terms of equity story for us,"" he added.
LOW SPENDING 
Several analysts and industry executives have long lamented the state of play in Europe, insisting the current fragmentation shrunk revenues for companies in a context of rising demand for data usage by consumers.
Europe's average revenue per user (ARPU), a key indicator used within the industry, represents a third of that in the United States and half of Japanese levels.
""You need more consolidation in Europe, you need less regulation in Europe, you need higher data usage that gets monetized in Europe,"" said Rajeev Suri, the chief executive of Nokia (HE:NOKIA) , one of the world's top telecoms equipment makers, at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
Suri cited the relatively low European ARPU as a key factor that will explain the slow adoption of the next generation of mobile internet technology, or 5G.
A champion of competition within national markets and low prices for consumers, EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager would disagree.
Ever since she expressed concerns about a proposed merger of Telenor and TeliaSonera in Denmark in 2015 – leading to its collapse, Europe has not seen any big move on the M&A side. 
The total value of deals in the European telecoms sector at large, including the debt of targets, halved over the last two years, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Shares of Europe's benchmark telecoms stock index fell 17 percent (SXKP) over the same period, underperforming the broader Stoxx 600 index, which rose by 16 percent. 
INTERNAL DEALS
In Italy, the arrival of French telecoms maverick Iliad is expected in the next few weeks, a move favored by EU regulators in the wake of the merger of CK Hutchison Holdings and Veon's Italian businesses.
Iliad triggered a protracted mobile price war in France and intends to grab a quarter of the market share through low-cost offers, sources have said. 
""Is any consolidation really relevant when the implied costs of the remedies are higher than any benefit derived from the consolidation?” said a fund manager at a French bank with a stock-picking strategy. 
Still, the Vodafone-Liberty Global talks could lead to other deals within major European markets, according to several M&A bankers.
If the deal goes through, it would greatly reinforce Vodafone's presence in Germany and provide Liberty with fresh cash to spend.
""By selling EU assets Liberty will have options to do deals in the UK,"" a Britain-based telecoms banker said.
""Selling continental Europe means they will focus on building their UK business."" Liberty controls the Virgin Media business in Britain. 
Markets were also surprised by the bid for TDC, which is backed by consortium that include Danish pension funds and could be an example for Altice's (AS:ATCA) struggling French unit SFR, were it to be put on sale, several bankers said.
Yet cross-border transactions remain a distant prospect, for now at least. 

""In a couple of years I think we will see more cross-border consolidation - and I think it would be good for this industry,"" said Marie Ehrling, the chair of the board of Nordic telecoms operator Telia (ST:TELIA).

1232,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 10:01AM ET</span>",Safer VIX Is New Strategy for Short-Vol Assets Seeking Survival,"(Bloomberg) -- Two exchange-traded funds that survived a rival-destroying bout of volatility are adding a buffer to their strategies to protect investors -- and themselves.
The funds, which trade under the tickers VMIN and VMAX, are changing their methodologies to make them less sensitive to swings in daily volatility, according to a press release from REX Shares LLC, the company behind the products. Going forward, both will focus on futures that expire in two-to-six months, rather than contracts on the Cboe Volatility Index that expire in less than one month, the statement said.
Investors in an exchange-traded product run by  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG were wiped out when the VIX jumped the most in any day on record Feb. 5. XIV, which aimed to track short-term futures, slumped more than 90 percent on Feb. 6 and has since been liquidated by the Swiss bank. VMIN fell 69 percent that day. By moving out along the curve, the fund provider hopes to better insulate itself and investors against any similar event.
That’s because big moves in the VIX typically show up most vividly in the price of a contract that’s about to expire, rather than in one that still has months to run. Investors in longer-maturity contracts are therefore less exposed to day-to-day fluctuations in the VIX, like those that blew up XIV.
VMIN, which currently has about $10 million under management, could benefit from the maneuver. ZIV, a $130 million Credit Suisse ETN that has a similar strategy, slumped just 8 percent on Feb. 6, the same day its issuer said XIV would close. There’s a cost to that protection, though: ZIV returned 90 percent in 2017, versus XIV’s 188 percent.
For REX, the shift will begin March 7. The REX VolMAXX Short Weekly Futures Strategy ETF, also known as VMIN, will change its name to REX VolMAXX Short VIX Futures Strategy ETF on April 25, with the REX VolMAXX Long VIX Weekly Futures Strategy ETF (VMAX) becoming the REX VolMAXX Long VIX Futures Strategy ETF, the statement said.

(Reuters) - Broadcom Ltd (O:AVGO) on Monday called a proposal by U.S. semiconductor peer  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) for a new meeting to negotiate an increase to Broadcom's $117 billion acquisition offer ""engagement theater"" aimed at dodging a takeover battle.
Broadcom's statement came after Qualcomm said earlier on Monday that all of Broadcom's previous offers - which would represent the largest technology deal on record - materially undervalued it, but that it wanted to negotiate further.
Broadcom accused Qualcomm of feigning engagement in the companies' two meetings earlier this month. It also said Qualcomm has refused to confirm that it will hold its previously scheduled stockholder vote on March 6. Broadcom has put forward six nominees for election to Qualcomm's 11-member board as a way to force deal negotiations with Qualcomm.
""Broadcom does not believe that the process outlined by Qualcomm today is designed to lead to a prompt agreement,"" Broadcom said in a statement.
Qualcomm responded by denying it was considering moving the date of its annual shareholder meeting. The company added in a statement that it had no intention of delaying the meeting, and said it had made that clear in talks with Broadcom on Friday.
""The ball is in Broadcom's court to let us know whether it is willing to engage with us,"" Qualcomm said. 
In a letter to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan, Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs on Monday proposed a new meeting focused on price as soon as convenient for both parties. 
While the two companies have not yet resolved their disagreements on how to address potential antitrust hurdles, Qualcomm said they had made progress on that front.
""If the discussion is truly coming down to price alone, then we would call this progress,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.
The takeover battle is at the heart of a race to consolidate the wireless technology equipment sector, as smartphone makers such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  (KS:005930) use their market dominance to negotiate lower chip prices.
Broadcom cut its bid last week by 4 percent to $117 billion after Qualcomm's decision to raise its own bid for  NXP Semiconductors  NV (O:NXPI) to $44 billion.
Qualcomm's shares rose 5.8 percent to close Monday's trading at $66.98, still well below Broadcom's latest cash-and-stock offer of $79 per share.
Qualcomm also softened its approach to Broadcom's commitments on regulatory approval for the deal, saying the path forward did not require a ""hell or high water"" commitment to sell any assets that the regulators require.
Qualcomm, however, urged the Singapore-based chipmaker to provide more clarity regarding its plans for Qualcomm's licensing business, which Broadcom has been unwilling to reveal. It also offered to sign a confidentiality agreement so both companies can carry out due diligence on one another.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Banks increase CLO forecasts after Dodd-Frank court ruling,"By Kristen Haunss
NEW YORK (LPC) - Banks are expecting increased US Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) fund issuance after a US court ruled that the funds will shortly be exempt from regulations that require managers to hold some of their deal. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) increased its 2018 US CLO forecast by US$10bn to US$110bn following the decision and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) raised its forecast to US$120bn from US$110bn, according to reports this month. 
The US CLO market, the largest buyer of leveraged loans, cheered a decision by a US Court of Appeals on February 9 that the funds will be exempt from Dodd-Frank risk-retention rules, which require managers to hold 5% of their fund. Removing the retention hurdle should help more firms to raise deals, especially smaller managers that lacked the required capital.
Issuance is off to a strong start this year with US$13.5bn of CLOs printing through February 16, showing an increase of more than 700% in volume from the same period in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters LPC Collateral data. 
CLO forecasts for 2018 were already strong, ranging from US$90bn to a record US$140bn, but some banks now expect the court decision to fuel even more funds.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) kept its record US$140bn forecast in place, but increased its estimate for the number of deals that will be reworked, according to a February 20 report. The bank says US$110bn will be refinanced and US$120bn will be reset, up strongly from a January forecast of US$60bn of refinancings and US$105bn of resets.
JP Morgan also increased its forecast for US CLO refinancings and resets, raising it to US$115bn from US$70bn, according to a February 23 report.
Refinancings keep funds’ maturities in place but change the interest rate on one or more debt tranches, whereas resets extend maturities to allow CLOs to stay outstanding longer. Decreasing spreads paid to senior CLO debtholders increases the payout to investors in the most junior tranche, as equity holders receive the interest left over after all other investors are paid.
With the ruling, managers no longer need to raise long-term capital to refinance and improve the economics of older deals, which may drive more refinancing and reset activity, according to Maggie Wang, head of US CLO and Collateralized Debt Obligation research at Citigroup.
“Doing a reset will allow [managers] to modify terms and boost CLO equity [valuations] at the same time,” she said in an email.
Citigroup estimates US$11bn was raised to help managers comply with risk retention, and about US$3bn is still left to be deployed, according to the report. The retention vehicles will stay in place, but may seek more flexibility in order to invest in the equity of existing funds, the bank said.
Risk-retention vehicles brought new investors into the market that offered CLO managers long-term capital, said Jonathan Insull, managing director at Crescent Capital Group.
“The advantage of a dedicated pool of capital has been proven,” he said.
Earlier this month, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in favor of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA), the trade association representing the US CLO and leveraged loan markets. The LSTA sued the Federal Reserve and Securities and Exchange Commission in 2014 arguing risk retention was “arbitrary, capricious"" and ""an abuse of discretion.”
Regulators have 45 days from the ruling to seek an en banc review, a hearing in front of the active US Court of Appeals judges. There is also a separate 90-day window to request a Supreme Court review.
The market remains optimistic while it waits to see if the court’s decision will stand. 

The court ruling “will encourage more asset managers, particularly smaller ones, to issue CLOs in the US market,” Wang said.

1239,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 09:40AM ET</span>",Hedge funds did something highly unusual during the market's recent meltdown — and it's a great sign for stocks,"Moves in stocks that are the most popular with hedge funds have historically been an exaggerated version of the broader market, for better or worse.
When the equity market falls, hedge fund favorites tend to take an outsized beating, and vice versa. Which is why the group's performance was so surprising as the S&P 500 suffered a 10% correction earlier this month. Theoretically, it should've gotten smoked.
But the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP index — which consists of the 50 stocks that matter most to 808 hedge funds with $2.1 trillion under management — actually outperformed the benchmark during the turbulent period, according to the firm.
And while hedge funds are surely feeling like they dodged a bullet, the wider-reaching implications of their shocking resilience should also have them excited.
""The outperformance of the most popular hedge fund positions during the recent correction underscores the technical nature of the drawdown and the resilience of investor sentiment,"" a group of Goldman strategists led by Ben Snider wrote in a client note.
Put differently, the relatively muted losses in popular hedge fund holdings suggest the correction was based on something other than the core fundamentals that usually dictate market action. And that's great news for equities going forward.
The VIP index's lack of downside participation during the selloff has it up 4% year-to-date, roughly double the S&P 500, according to Goldman. As such, the group represents one of the most successful long positions in the market in 2018, as the chart below shows.
The composition of Goldman's VIP basket also suggests the basket could continue to outperform. As of year-end 2017, tech stocks had the largest net portfolio weighting out of any sector.
The industry is expected to see earnings growth of 31% in 2018, a full 10 basis points more than the S&P 500. And considering profit expansion has been the foremost driver of gains throughout the nine-year stock bull market, the rest of the year looks bright for the tech sector, and by extension hedge funds.
That said, fund managers don't seem content with their tech holdings, and are continuing to pile in. They've poured roughly $10 billion into the sector over the past three months, the most since at least 2005 for a period of that length.
It remains to be seen whether or not this boldness will end up backfiring. If popular hedge fund holdings resume their historical ""high beta"" role, declines could get messy for the VIP index the next time the market gets rocked."

1241,By Business Insider,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 09:38AM ET</span>",BUFFETT: The JPMorgan-Amazon-Berkshire Hathaway healthcare venture 'is looking for something bigger' than shaving a few percent off costs,"In  an interview with CNBC on Monday, the legendary investor said the  recently announced venture between Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan, and Amazon to address healthcare costs could grow and become ""something that other people can pick up on.""
While the details around the venture  are still vague at best, Buffett said the initiative led by him, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was an attempt to get the private sector to do more about skyrocketing healthcare costs.
Buffett said that the partnership is ""looking for something much bigger"" than just shaving off a few percentage points from healthcare costs.
""It isn't difficult to shave a little bit off here, the question is whether we can come up with something better,"" he continued. ""I'm hopeful but don't expect any miracles.""
Buffett also said the venture should have its own CEO within a year and picking the right person is the ""first and most important job"" that will set the direction of the partnership.
Additionally, the Berkshire CEO said his relationship with Bezos and Dimon should help make big changes easier for the new initiative. 
""Our companies are big and we can still make things happen,"" Buffett told CNBC. ""We don't have bureaucratic problems or constituency problems that some others might and we like we each other, we trust each other.""
Despite the massive amounts of capital the three companies have, Buffett said the venture is not looking to acquire any healthcare-specific firm to grow the business.
Buffett's stated goals for the venture echo what  Dimon told Business Insider earlier in February.
""There are ways that, when you face this, maybe we can change things to make it much better for everybody,"" Dimon said. ""We want happier employees, better medical outcomes, and I do think at the end of the day that'll actually be cheaper."""

Not Yet, Say JPMorgan Strategists","(Bloomberg) -- Equities linked to economic growth are roundly beating those seen as less sensitive, and the crowded trade still has a bit to go, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
The strategy of going long cyclicals and short defensives hasn’t yet peaked, but “we are getting close,” the bank’s equity strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note Monday, highlighting a strong relative performance in both Europe and the U.S. this year. Notwithstanding this month’s global selloff, sectors including information technology, materials and consumer discretionary have outperformed peers in real estate, consumer staples and utilities in 2018.
After beating defensive shares in the last couple of years, relative valuations of cyclicals are looking stretched, while economic output momentum has probably peaked -- a sign that stocks more sensitive to growth may start to lag, the strategists say. On the plus side, they note that earnings remain constructive, with revisions proving better for cyclicals. Rising bond yields, closely watched by equity investors this year, is another favorable factor.
“Bond yield direction is a very important consideration for the trade,” the strategists wrote. “Cyclicals look much better than defensives in the backdrop of yields continuing to move higher, which remains our view.”
JPMorgan says it will keep its preference for cyclicals over defensives unless bond yields “exhaust their upward momentum” and activity indicators dip more sharply.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose sharply on Monday, led by gains across sectors as investors bet that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will stick to a gradual rate-hike approach despite indications that inflation is perking up.
Powell faces questions from both houses of the U.S. Congress in a semi-annual testimony starting on Tuesday, his first major set piece since he took over from Janet Yellen earlier this month.
His testimony comes at a time when investors have been anxious about the pace of rate hikes, which have weighed on equity markets globally. 
""I don't think he's going to say anything dovish or hawkish - in an attempt to at least have the first appearance to be down the middle or balanced,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in Boston.
""I surely think the current Fed would let some inflationary pressure run hotter than their target for a period without getting more aggressive.""
The Fed said on Friday it expected economic growth to remain steady and saw no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes.
The U.S. 10-year Treasury yields eased to 2.8587 percent (US10YT=RR), slipping from the four-year high it hit last week, while the CBOE Volatility index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, was last at 16.12.

The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 51.29 points, or 0.7 percent, at 7,388.68.
Technology stocks (SPLRCT), which led the S&P 500 sectors on Monday, have been the top gainers so far this year, with an 8.6 percent rise.
Qualcomm (O:QCOM) was up 3.4 percent after the chipmaker urged Broadcom (O:AVGO) to enter into price negotiations for the first time on Broadcom's $117 billion offer for the company.
 General Electric  (N:GE) dipped 1.73 percent and was the most traded stock across all U.S. exchanges after the company nominated three new candidates to its board.

1266,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Toyota pursues petrol but sees electric potential in new technology,"By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) stuck to its commitment to improving petrol engines on Monday with new powertrain units, while flagging technologies which could find their way into electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs).
The Japanese automaker plans to keep refining its petrol engines and the hybrid technology it pioneered two decades ago while also developing battery operated cars as tightening global emissions rules drive a race for longer-range affordable EVs.
As high battery prices and range limitations restrain EV take-up, hybrids and plug-in hybrids would be dominant in coming years, Mitsumasa Yamagata, chief engineer at Toyota's power train product planning division, said.
Cars using petrol engines in some form would still account for around 90 percent of all vehicles by 2030, he added. 
""Developing the most fuel-efficient powertrains using petrol engines and hybrid systems will be the best way to have an impact (on reducing emissions), and we remain committed to this,"" he said at a briefing on Toyota's new 2.0 liter petrol engine and hybrid systems, which can improve fuel economy by 18 percent and 9 percent, respectively, over its current systems. 
""At the same time, we will be able to use the technology developed for these powertrains in EVs and FCVs."" 
Already lagging Nissan Motor Co (T:7201), General Motors (N:GM) and BMW (DE:BMWG) in bringing a mass-production EV to market, Toyota has ramped up its EV development in the last year or so, pledging to add more than 10 EV models to its product line-up in the early 2020s after long touting a green-car strategy focusing mainly on hybrids and FCVs. 
Last week it announced it had developed ultra-powerful magnets containing fewer rare earth metals which can be used in EVs, while it has also partnered up with Panasonic Corp (T:6752) to develop EV batteries.
Yamagata said that components for petrol vehicles could also be used in EVs, including a new ""launch"" gear used in Toyota's continuously variable transmission unveiled on Monday which works with a smaller belt drive to enable smoother, more efficient initial acceleration and final deceleration.
Industry experts anticipate that take-up of EVs will pick up faster than Toyota expects as decreasing battery costs result in a cost parity between EVs and gasoline-engine cars around 2025, but some say that it could leverage its lead in hybrid technology to help stay competitive during this transition.

""Toyota has been developing its hybrid technology since the 1990s and has been improving it all along. This is complex technology which would take a lot of effort (for others) to develop originally,"" CLSA analyst Chris Richter said.

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 09:41PM ET</span>",U.S. asset manager State Street to press gunmakers on safety efforts,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. asset manager  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) said it plans to seek details from gunmakers on how they will support the ""safe and responsible use of their products,"" adding to pressure on the industry after the Feb. 14 shooting that killed 17 people at a Florida high school.
Other firms, including Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), are also reviewing relations with the weapons industry, as social media and shareholder activism open new fronts in a long-running U.S. debate over firearms. 
As a large shareholder in weapons makers such as American Outdoor Brands Corp and Sturm Ruger & Co Inc, Boston-based State Street wields extra clout, including the ability to vote against directors and to back shareholder resolutions on gun safety pending at each company.
""We will be engaging with weapons manufacturers and distributors to seek greater transparency from them on the ways that they will support the safe and responsible use of their products,"" State Street spokesman Andrew Hopkins said in an emailed statement, sent on Friday evening. 
The statement also said State Street will monitor the companies' lobbying activities.
State Street is joining larger rival BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) in putting weapons executives on the spot. On Feb. 22, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, said it will speak with gunmakers and distributors ""to understand their response"" to the Florida shooting.
Representatives for American Outdoor and Sturm Ruger did not respond to questions over the weekend.
Private insurance broker Lockton, which has worked with the National Rifle Association (NRA) on gun show and gun carrying policies, also said that it will discontinue selling NRA-endorsed products.
""Lockton Affinity has notified the NRA that it will discontinue providing brokerage services for NRA-endorsed insurance programs under the terms of its contract,"" Lockton said in a tweet on Monday.
State Street, with $2.8 trillion under management at Dec. 31, owns about 2 percent of the shares of both American Outdoor and Sturm Ruger, according to filings.
Bank of America said on Saturday it would ask clients who make assault rifles how they can help end mass shootings. Other financial firms have cut marketing ties with NRA recently, including the First National Bank of Omaha, which will not renew a contract to issue an NRA-branded Visa card.
The fund manager statements were striking, given that many major investors try to steer clear of political debates to avoid alienating customers. But asset managers lately have supported more social and environmental measures sought by their clients.
Both American Outdoor and Sturm Ruger face shareholder resolutions filed by religious investors calling for them to report on their gun safety efforts, aimed for shareholder meetings later this year.
Patrick McGurn, special counsel for proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services, said directors on the boards of both should expect tough questions from shareholders.
""Guns join opioids, cyber hacks, sexual harassment, human rights and climate change as top-of-mind risks that shareholders will want to discuss with boards during engagements and at annual meetings,"" McGurn said via e-mail.
Not all top fund firms are taking a public stance on the weapons debate. 
Vanguard Group Inc said in a statement e-mailed by a spokesman on Friday that while it discusses with companies whose shares it owns ""the impact of their business on society,"" the Pennsylvania fund manager also ""believes we can be more effective in advocating for change by not publicly discussing the nature of engagements with specific companies by name.""
A spokesman for Fidelity Investments said via e-mail on Sunday that the firm generally does not comment on individual companies or how it plans to vote on proxy resolutions.
""We do our best to see that our investment decisions are in line with our fiduciary obligation to ensure that every Fidelity fund is managed based on the investment objective described in its prospectus,"" she said.
The concerns of financial firms over gun safety chime with a wider debate on corporate links with the NRA, following the Florida shooting.
Shipper FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) on Monday said it would not drop the NRA's access to discounts, since it did not change rates in response to customers' political views. But it said it differed with the NRA on gun policy.

""FedEx views assault rifles and large capacity magazines as an inherent potential danger to schools, workplaces, and communities when such weapons are misused. We therefore support restricting them to the military,"" it said in a statement.

1268,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 07:32AM ET</span>",Goldman Says Stocks May Dive 25% If 10-Year Yield Hits 4.5%,"(Bloomberg) -- If the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hits 4.5 percent by year-end, the economy would probably muddle through -- stocks, not so much, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).
Goldman’s base-case scenario calls for a 10-year yield of 3.25 percent by the end of 2018, though a “stress test” out to 4.5 percent indicates such a move would cause stocks to tumble, economist Daan Struyven wrote in a note Saturday. He also said the economy would probably suffer a sharp slowdown but not a recession.
“A rise in rates to 4.5 percent by year-end would cause a 20 percent to 25 percent decline in equity prices,” the note said.
While a recent drop in stocks may have been fueled by concerns tied to the 10-year yield approaching 3 percent, many strategists have said they felt equities could continue to rise until reaching 3.5 percent or 4 percent. It’s trading around 2.86 percent as of 6 a.m. New York time Monday.
READ: Market’s Red Line for Yields Isn’t Where Most People Think
A 20 percent to 25 percent drop in stocks, as measured from the S&P 500’s Jan. 26 peak close of 2,872.87, would take the gauge to a range of approximately 2,155-2,298. It closed on Friday at 2,747.30 after dropping as low as 2,581 on Feb. 8 at the apex of the recent volatility-fueled meltdown. If this scenario did play out with Goldman’s numbers, stocks would have a long way further down to go.

1277,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 07:10AM ET</span>",New board members proposed for Israel's Bezeq amid police investigation,"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - The parent company of Bezeq Israel Telecom (TA:BEZQ) is seeking to appoint new members to the company's board to replace three directors who submitted resignations amid an ongoing police investigation of fraud and other securities offences.
The resignations were sought by minority shareholders in the wake of the investigation started by Israel's markets regulator last year. The probe threatens to create a power vacuum at Israel's largest telecoms group.
Former Bezeq chairman Shaul Elovitch said he will step down from the board as will his son and daughter-in-law, parent company B Communications (Bcom) (TA:BCOM) said on Monday.
Elovitch, a family friend of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who controls Bezeq through Bcom parent Eurocom, was arrested last week along with his wife and son. They are in police custody but will be brought to court on Monday morning for a hearing on their request to be released.
They all deny any wrongdoing.
Bcom is proposing former Bezeq chairman Shlomo Rodav and Doron Turgeman -- CEO of Eurocom subsidiary  Internet Gold  (TA:IGLD) -- to the board.
In addition, a group of investors led by U.S.-Israeli businessman Naty Saidoff has proposed biotechnology executive Tamir Cohen to the board. An offer for the indebted Eurocom from Saidoff's group has been accepted by Eurocom's creditors and submitted to court for approval.
Elovitch last June temporarily stepped down as chairman of Bezeq and was replaced by acting chairman David Granot.
Israeli media had reported on Sunday that Chief Executive Stella Handler, who is also in police custody, would be replaced at least temporarily, but there has been no such decision. 
She and another company official were arrested last week in connection with the Israel Securities Authority's (ISA) investigation of Bezeq over allegations including fraud, bribery and securities offences.
They are in police custody and will also be brought to court on Monday.
They also deny any wrongdoing.

Amid a 29 percent drop in Bezeq's shares in 2017, activist investor Elliott, which has a 4.8 percent stake, has called for the resignation of all Bezeq directors implicated in the investigation and those affiliated with Eurocom.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Monday said the healthcare company being set up by  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) will within a year have a new chief executive officer, and set an aggressive goal to cut costs.
Speaking on CNBC television, Buffett said ""we can't afford to make a mistake"" in finding the right CEO to help combat spiraling healthcare costs that now account for close to 18 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, or $10,000 per person.
Buffett said it would not be difficult to ""shave"" off 3 or 4 percentage points, contrasting the situation to 1960, when he said healthcare costs accounted for just 5 percent of GDP, or $170 per person.
""We are at a huge competitive disadvantage in American business"" relative to other industrialized countries because of the costs, Buffett said. ""The question is whether we can come up with something better. I'm hopeful, but don't expect any miracles.""
Berkshire, Amazon and JPMorgan last month said they would start a healthcare venture for their workers.
While few details were provided, shares of several insurers and pharmacy benefits managers fell on the news because investors worried how the venture might disrupt the industry.
Buffett said that in starting the venture, ""we have the perfect partnership"" with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Todd Combs, an investment manager for Buffett and a JPMorgan, will spearhead Berkshire's involvement.
WELLS FARGO
The interview occurred two days after Buffett released his shorter-than-usual annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, which had little discussion about the company's investments.
One is  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), the third-largest U.S. bank, which was surprisingly ordered this month by the Federal Reserve to curb asset growth while it tries to rebound from scandals over how it treated customers.
Buffett, whose Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate owns nearly 10 percent of Wells Fargo, on Monday said ""I have confidence in Tim Sloan,"" the bank's CEO.
He likened the situation to 1991, when Buffett was installed as chairman of Salomon Brothers Inc amid a bond trading scandal that nearly landed that company in bankruptcy.
""Digging your way out of it takes time,"" Buffett said. ""He's got a lot to clean up.""
Buffett also discussed other means to deploy Berkshire's $116 billion cash stake, after saying in the letter he desired one or more ""huge"" acquisitions of non-insurance businesses.
He said he would be ""more inclined"" to buy back stock than pay dividends, and might raise the repurchase threshold from 1.2 times book value. Berkshire's stock traded at roughly 1.44 times book value based on Friday's market close.
""I am fairly confident we will find ways to deploy"" excess cash, Buffett said. ""The best chance to deploy money is when things are going down.""
Also helping Berkshire will be the recent cut in the U.S. corporate income tax rate, which gave Berkshire a one-time $29.11 billion net income boost by reducing its potential tax bill on stocks it owns.
The cut is a ""huge tailwind"" for U.S. companies and is ""really good for Berkshire,"" Buffett said.
Buffett also said that while stocks remained a better bet than bonds over the long-term, it remained ""crazy"" for ordinary investors to use margin, or borrowed cash, to load up on stocks. 

He said investors might get a ""euphoric surge"" if they double their money in stocks, but would not be ""happier.""

1288,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 11:53AM ET</span>","GE names accounting, turnaround experts to board","By Arunima Banerjee and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) nominated top aviation and industrial executives and an accounting expert to its board on Monday, as it seeks to restructure its business and restore investors' confidence in one of the largest U.S. industrial conglomerates.
The Boston-based multinational, which racked up a $10 billion loss in the fourth quarter, was the worst-performing stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year. It fell another 3.5 percent on Monday.
GE said on Friday that it was facing potential legal action by the U.S. Department of Justice in connection with subprime mortgages. It also said a restatement of its 2016 and 2017 results would likely lower reported earnings.
Those problems along with long-term care contracts, which resulted in a $6 billion charge on its insurance businesses last year, drew criticism from billionaire U.S. investor Warren Buffett in an interview on CNBC on Monday.
""I would say the accounting at GE has not been a model at all in recent years, but you can make mistakes,"" said Buffett, who exited his stake in GE last year.
""Long-term care has probably been the biggest single element of mis-reserving in insurance throughout the industry ... but I was staggered by the amount of it (at GE).""
One of the new directors named on Monday was Leslie Seidman, a former JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Vice President and chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board nicknamed ""Loophole Leslie"" by opponents for her bank-friendly approach to regulation after the 2008 financial crash.
The other two were Thomas Horton, who oversaw the restructuring and merger of American Airlines with US Airways, and Lawrence Culp Jr., who as former CEO of Danaher Corp (N:DHR) transformed the company from a manufacturer into a science and technology firm.
REVAMP
Chief Executive John Flannery has promised to revamp GE into a leaner company by exiting several businesses and the company has already announced a series of job cuts to lower costs that have dented profits and disappointed investors.
Horton, also a director at Walmart (NYSE:WMT), was chief financial officer at AT&T Inc (N:T) when it combined with fellow telecoms Cingular and SBC in 2005, and is currently at the forefront of merger negotiations between chipmakers Broadcom Ltd (O:AVGO) and  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM).
""We are adding proven world-class expertise in capital allocation, aviation, accounting and financial reporting,"" GE Lead Director Jack Brennan said.
Analysts, however, said the nominations to the board - to be cut to 12 directors from a previous 18 and voted on by shareholders in April - would do little to distract from the problems accumulating for GE.
""This remains a 'liability story',"" JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said. ""We see weak core free cash flow as too structurally challenged to de-lever the balance sheet, leaving the company prone to risks around further contingent liabilities, and/or capital markets volatility.""
GE said nine of the company's directors will stand for re-election including major shareholder Trian Fund Management's Edward Garden, who was appointed to GE's board in October.

GE's stock fell 45 percent last year and is down another 17 percent so far in 2018.

1291,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Former proxy solicitation firm employees face U.S. fraud trial,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - Four former employees at a firm that advises companies on shareholder votes will face trial on Monday in a case that prosecutors say shows how secret corporate information can be misused for purposes other than just insider trading.
Federal prosecutors in Boston allege that employees at Georgeson LLC schemed to bribe someone working at Institutional Shareholder Services for details about how the proxy advisory firm's investor clients had voted on shareholder proposals.
The four defendants - Michael Sedlak, Donna Ackerly, Charles Garske and Richard Gottcent - deny wrongdoing and have pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and honest services fraud charges.
The trial follows a long-running probe into Georgeson, a leading proxy solicitation firm owned by Computershare Ltd (AX:CPU). Georgeson in November agreed to pay $4.5 million and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve related charges.
The case followed investigations by federal prosecutors in Boston into what they called a black market for secret corporate information that can be used for purposes other than insider trading.
Prosecutors said Brian Bennett from 2007 to 2012 used his job at ISS to supply Sedlak with information in exchange for concert and sports tickets worth $12,000, including two costing $800 each for a Boston Red Sox baseball game.
Sedlak forwarded the information to Georgeson employees Ackerly, Garske, Gottcent and Keith Haynes, some of whom then provided it to their corporate clients, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors said Ackerly, Garske and Haynes also arranged to have the bribes billed to clients using invoices that included false descriptions, such as ""courier services.""
The goal, prosecutors said, was to gain a competitive edge to help companies determine if particular proposals would pass or fail and shape strategies that could affect the outcome of shareholder votes.
In a 2010 email, Sedlak told Bennett he could not obtain information about investors' votes elsewhere, such as by asking them, prosecutors said.
""80% of clients do not divulge,"" Sedlak wrote. ""They just say they voted if that - they don't want the harassing phone calls either.""
Justine Harris, Garske's lawyer, at an October hearing argued Bennett's information was ""essentially in the public sphere already.""
""It was essentially available to everyone in the industry, and it gave no business advantage to Georgeson whatsoever,"" she said.
Bennett and Haynes are expected to testify for the prosecution after pleading guilty. ISS in 2013 paid $300,000 to resolve U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it failed to safeguard client information.
The case is U.S. v. Ackerly, et al, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 16-cr-10233.

The European Employee Representative Council (EERC), an unofficial pan-European body set up by Ryanair pilots to mobilize for better conditions last year, said it believed large numbers of pilots were leaving the airline and that O'Leary had failed to resolve the problem.
Several pilot unions have said that the EERC represents a significant number of the airline's more than 4,000 pilots, but Ryanair management has dismissed it as a front for ""competitor pilot unions."" 
In a letter to O'Leary seen by Reuters, the EERC said that the number of pilots leaving the airline had not decreased since a shortage of standby pilots last year led the airline to cancel 20,000 flight and trim its growth plans. 
""By our assessment, it looks like further cancellations are inevitable due to the continuing resignations of pilots,"" the letter said. 
A senior Ryanair executive earlier this month said the airline had more than enough pilots to operate its schedule. 
The letter said pilots had noticed in recent weeks an increase in the number of requests to work on days off, something pilots say happened in the lead-up to the cancellations. 
At the same time, the letter repeated an offer to help convince pilots to work extra hours and it described O'Leary's predictions of strike action in the coming weeks as ""alarmist.""
O'Leary said last week that he believed strike action was likely during Easter week.
The airline averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas by announcing plans to recognize pilots' unions for the first time in its 32-year history.
But talks with pilot unions to formalize union recognition and improved terms have stalled in recent weeks. While Ryanair says talks are ongoing in seven countries, only British union BALPA has signed a recognition agreement.
""We suggest you leave now, and we call on the board and investors to engage a new CEO to return this airline to its rightful place,"" the EERC letter said. 
Ryanair said in a statement that the EERC and its communications had ""no legal standing or validity.""
It said that 80 percent of Ryanair pilots had already accepted a 20 percent pay increase that the EERC has opposed on the grounds that accepting it could prejudice future talks between management and trade unions.

While the ECB President Mario Draghi is to make a speech at the European Parliament on Monday afternoon, the new U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is to give his first House testimony on Tuesday. 
At 0945 GMT, the pan-European STOXX benchmark index (STOXX) was up 0.54 percent at 383.20 points in lower than usual volumes after Asian shares made guarded gains. 
""There's a sense of a beaten up squeeze behind the rally this morning"", a trader commented as a number of shares which investors have often bet against, enjoyed strong gains without any corporate announcement apparently justifying the rise. 
He mentioned Satellite firms  SES  (LU:SESFg), up 9.4 percent, German drugs packaging firm Gerresheimer's (DE:GXIG) up 2.7 percent or France's pipe maker Vallourec (PA:VLL) up 4.5 percent. 
Nordic telecom companies Nokia (HE:NOKIA) and Ericsson (ST:ERICb) were up 4.1 percent and 3.8 percent respectively.

 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) rose 0.7 percent after it said it would float its asset management arm DWS on the Frankfurt stock exchange, as it fights to regain investor trust afters years of scandals and restructuring.
Lloyd's of London underwriter  Hiscox  (L:HSX) posted the worst performance of the index with a 4.7 percent fall after it reported a fall of more than 90 percent in full-year pretax profit, as it faced the costliest year ever for insurers and reinsurers due to natural disasters. 
Bank of Ireland (I:BIRG) was down 2.9 percent. The lender said it would resume dividend payments for the first time since the financial crisis and reported underlying profits steady at 1.1 billion euros.

The BBSW is the primary interest rate benchmark used in Australian financial markets to price home loans, credit cards and other financial products.

1304,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 04:37PM ET</span>",The Weinstein Company says it will file for bankruptcy,"By Jessica DiNapoli and Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) - The Weinstein Company said late on Sunday that the U.S. film studio, whose ex-chairman Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault, planned to file for bankruptcy in the coming days after talks to sell itself collapsed.
Filing for bankruptcy protection creates more uncertainty about how women who allege they are victims of Weinstein could be compensated. 
The scuppered deal had a provision for a victims' fund, but in bankruptcy the women may now be treated as unsecured creditors that can recoup only pennies on the dollar for their claims. 
The Weinstein Company had been close to inking an agreement this month to be taken over by investors led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet for more than $500 million, but a lawsuit filed by New York's Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on Feb. 11 complicated the negotiations.
Schneiderman had wanted any deal to provide adequate compensation to women who said they were victims of Weinstein, protect the company's employees and to not reward executives who allegedly knew of the abuse.
Schneiderman's office said in a statement on Monday it was disappointed in the collapse of the deal discussions, which included a commitment from the buyers for up to $90 million in victim compensation, and that it would continue to investigate alleged abuse by Weinstein.
More than 70 women have accused Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most influential men, of sexual misconduct including rape. Weinstein denies having non-consensual sex with anyone.
""A deal (to sell the company) would have been best for everyone involved, including victims, assuming a sizeable amount of money was set aside from the acquisition to compensate victims,"" said New York lawyer Doug Wigdor, who represents multiple victims of Weinstein’s alleged abuse.
Others said the bankruptcy would not necessarily limit claims and could introduce more oversight to the creation of a victims' fund.
“We don’t think that the bankruptcy will ultimately limit what the victims could get,” said Elizabeth Fegan, an attorney representing victims in a pending class action lawsuit. “Our claims are not only against The Weinstein Company but also against the board of directors, which will continue to have liability.”
Fegan added that victims may also be repaid by insurance policies for The Weinstein Company and its directors and officers.
Contreras-Sweet's latest offer did not meet the requirements of Schneiderman's office and did not set aside enough money to ensure the company's approximately 150 employees would be paid while waiting for the deal to close, according to a letter from the board of directors of The Weinstein Company to Contreras-Sweet and one of her investors, billionaire Ron Burkle of The Yucaipa Companies LLC. 
""While we recognize that this is an extremely unfortunate outcome for our employees, our creditors and any victims, the board has no choice but to pursue its only viable option to maximize the Company’s remaining value: an orderly bankruptcy process,"" the company said in an emailed statement.
In its letter, The Weinstein Company said the acquisition offer would increase the liabilities left behind for the studio, ""charting a financial path that will fail."" It added that the deal could take many months to close.
In a statement, Contreras-Sweet said that it was her understanding that she was ""close to signing the transaction documents in a couple days."" 
""Regrettably, it appears that this transaction has now ended,"" she said, adding that it had always been her goal to build a company led by women, retain employees and represent the ""gold standard in governance and transparency.""

The Weinstein Company, which Reuters has reported as having debts of roughly $375 million, launched in October 2005 and has produced and distributed films including “The King’s Speech” and “Silver Linings Playbook.”

1308,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 05:29AM ET</span>",Corporate America’s new dilemma: raising prices to cover higher transport costs,"By Eric M. Johnson and Chris Prentice
SEATTLE/BOCA RATON, Fla. (Reuters) - The drive for cost cuts and higher margins at U.S. trucking and railroad operators is pinching their biggest customers, forcing the likes of  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) and  Hormel Foods Corp  (NYSE:HRL) to spend more on deliveries and consider raising their own prices as a way to pass along the costs. 
Interviews with executives at 10 companies across the food, consumer goods and commodities sectors reveal that many are grappling with how to defend their profit margins as transportation costs climb at nearly double the inflation rate.
Two executives told Reuters their companies do plan to raise prices, though they would not divulge by how much. A third said it was discussing prospective price increases with retailers. 
The prospect of higher prices on chicken, cereal and snacks costs comes as inflation emerged as a more distinct threat in recent weeks. The U.S. Labor Department reported earlier this month that underlying consumer prices in January posted their biggest gain in more than a year. 
As U.S. economic growth has revved up, railroads and truck fleets have not expanded capacity to keep pace - a decision applauded by Wall Street. Shares of CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX),  Norfolk Southern  (NYSE:NSC), and  Union Pacific  Corp (NYSE:UNP) have risen an average 22 percent over the past year as they cut headcount, locomotives and rail cars, and lengthened trains to lower expenses and raise margins.
Quickening economic growth, a shortage of drivers and reduced capacity, and higher fuel prices have driven up transportation costs, prompting some companies to threaten to raise prices on goods ranging from chicken to cereal.

Cream of Wheat maker B&G Foods Inc, Cheerios maker General Mills and  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), owner of Hillshire Farms brand and Jimmy Dean sausage, said they will pass along higher freight costs to their customers.
Tyson Chief Executive Officer Tom Hayes told Reuters in an interview that its price increases ""should be in place for the second half” of its fiscal year, and that it has begun negotiating price increases with retailers and food service operators. The company declined to specify how much its freight costs increased in recent months, but a spokesman said they are up between 10 to 15 percent for the total industry.
General Mills informed convenience store and food service customers of the price increases directly, a spokeswoman told Reuters in an emailed statement, declining to provide specifics. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening cited logistic costs and wage inflation as factors. 
""It feels to me like an environment that should be beneficial for some pricing,” he said in a presentation at last week’s Consumer Analyst Group of New York conference.
Hormel Foods, the maker of Skippy peanut butter and SPAM, has been talking with retailers about raising prices, according to Chief Executive Jim Snee.
“We don’t believe we’re going to recoup all of our freight cost increases for the balance of the year,” Snee told Reuters in an interview, noting operating margin sank to 13.2 percent, from 15.6 percent due to higher costs - including freight - in the most recent quarter. 
Confectionary and snack company  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) halted operations over a weekend late last month at its Toledo, Ohio wheat flour mill - the second-largest flour mill in the United States - because the plant could not get enough rail cars to carry flour to bakeries, a spokeswoman said. 
She declined to comment on whether Mondelez would raise prices to cover any higher costs.
A new government regulation for drivers and truck availability are pushing up freight costs at JM Smucker Co. “We anticipate inflationary pressures likely to cause upward price movements in a variety of categories,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Belgya said last week at an analyst conference.
To be sure, transportation costs are just a sliver of the price consumers pay at the grocery store. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates transportation represents just 3.3 cents of every dollar consumers spend.
But an increase in truck rates over the next 12 months implies a 15-to-18 basis point gross margin headwind for U.S. food companies on average, according to Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard.
“A lot of the consumer goods companies work on margin,” said Joe Glauber, a former USDA Chief Economist and a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute. “They are going to be pushing those costs along” to retailers. Ultimately “consumers end up shouldering more of the burden,” he said.
That would be a change for consumers who have seen years of low-to-negative food inflation, he noted.
RISING COSTS HIT EARNINGS
Prices of key commodity ingredients including corn, sugar and cocoa remain relatively low due to bumper harvests around the globe. But even as companies’ freight costs increase, their packaging costs are also rising, industry analysts said. 
Global energy prices have risen sharply from 2016’s lows, driving up prices for not only diesel but also packing material like plastics, which are byproducts of crude and natural gas.
Others companies have blamed freight hikes for lower earnings forecasts for 2018, including U.S. oilfield services company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co. It shaved ten cents per share from its earnings forecast last week due to delays in deliveries of sand used in fracking. 
""They try to squeeze every dollar for profit rather than provide service,"" said Robert Murray, the chief executive of Murray Energy Corporation, the largest privately-owned U.S. coal company which relies on CSX and Norfolk Southern to help transport its goods. 
Murray said both CSX and Norfolk Southern have lacked rail cars and crew to haul 4 million tons of coal from mines in West Virginia and Ohio to the Port of Baltimore this year. 
CSX spokesman Christopher Smith said its service has improved steadily over recent months and it was working with customers to solve problems. Norfolk Southern declined to comment.
At an analyst conference Thursday, Norfolk Southern Chief Financial Officer Cynthia Earhart said that the railroad was looking to raise prices on consumer goods and other truck-competitive freight it hauls in 2018. But she said it had no plans to increase headcount or move equipment out of storage, despite worsening train speeds and rail car idle times in the first quarter. 
Earhart said the railroad was moving some employees to problem spots, like its terminal in Birmingham, Alabama, from other areas of its network.
Union Pacific has started pulling stored locomotives back into service and plans to bring back 600 employees in the first quarter 2018 to prevent rail cars from spending too much time in yards, said Union Pacific spokeswoman Raquel Espinoza.
The time UP rail cars were sitting idle in terminals rose to 32.5 hours in the fourth quarter from 29 hours in the year-ago period, and its overall workforce dropped during the last two quarters, according to company data. 
Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF said winter weather has impacted velocity and fluidity on portions of its primary route between the Pacific Northwest and Midwest, but said it has not been cutting crews and rolling stock.
“NO SLACK IN THE SYSTEM” 
U.S. truck fleets have not kept pace with growing demand for different reasons, industry executives said. The April 1 enforcement deadline for a federal regulation requiring drivers to electronically log their hours has effectively curtailed capacity, adding to a chronic shortage of people willing to drive trucks for the wages offered. 
Tight capacity means trucking firms have leverage as they negotiate freight rates. Dry van shipping rates are expected to rise as much as 10 percent in 2018, while ""spot"" rates for last-minute cargo hit record levels in January before falling slightly, according to online freight marketplace DAT Solutions.
Chemical maker Chemours Company estimates 30 percent of its rail shipments have highly unpredictable delivery times, while automaker Toyota Motor Corp has struggled periodically to get rail cars for finished vehicles at plants served by the major railroads. 
""If I was to ask for anything, it's consistency,"" said Lee Hobgood, general manager of Toyota's transportation operations. ""I am not feeling cuts. I am feeling imbalance at times.""
Agribusiness giant Cargill declined to quantify how much its freight costs are going up and whether it would pass costs on to its customers. But at a soybean processing plant near Lafayette, Ind., Cargill has had such long delays getting loaded railcars moved out, the company plans to buy its own Trackmobile railcar mover to relieve the congestion. One Trackmobile unit can cost at least $250,000.
Brad Hildebrand, Cargill's Global Rail and Barge Lead, told Reuters the Lafayette plant otherwise could shut down. 

""When we load a train at one of our eastern elevators it sits for an extended period of time before locomotive power and crews can come in,"" Hildebrand said. ""There is no slack in the system to handle weather problems or even a small uptick in demand.""

Last October,  Hangzhou Huning  Elevator Parts Co (SZ:300669), a little-known Chinese elevator maker whose name is similar to Chinese Communist Party theoretician Wang Huning, surged after Wang got promoted to China's top political body. 
In November, 2016, when news headlines pointed to the likely presidential election win for Donald Trump, shares jumped in Wisesoft Co Ltd - whose Chinese name sounds like ""Trump's big win"". Yunan Xiyi Industrial, whose Chinese sounds similar to ""Aunt Hillary"", meanwhile slumped.
Bets on so-called ""concept"" stocks - a popular practice in China - underscore the enduring influence of short-term speculators, despite a campaign by regulators against ""pump and dump"" trading ahead of the inclusion this June of China's A-shares in MSCI's global indexes.
Shandong Shenguang's Yang said the possible extension of Xi's tenure could help ensure political stability and would be good for promoting deeper and wider economic reforms.
Yang's view was echoed by brokerage Everbright Sun Hung Kai, which said a more powerful Xi could make policy implementation more efficient, for example at local government and state-owned enterprise (SOEs) levels.
But the market's knee-jerk response to the proposed constitutional change already showed signs of being short-lived. 
Vatti Corp (SZ:002035), whose name stands for ""Chinese emperor"" in Chinese, opened up 7.3 percent, but had retreated to be up just 1 percent by midday.

And meat products maker Huangshanghuang (SZ:002695), whose name mimics an address by subordinates to an emperor, also gave up sharp early gains.

1311,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 12:30AM ET</span>",Oil Gains on Libyan Halt as Saudis Promise a Stable End to Curbs,"(Bloomberg) -- Oil gained as Libya’s crude exports from a key terminal were disrupted and Saudi Arabia pledged that global producers will ease their output curbs without shocking the market.
Futures in New York rose as much as 0.6 percent, after rising 3 percent the previous two sessions. Libya’s crude loadings from the Mellitah terminal will be “modified” after protests impeded output at the El-Feel field. Cuts by OPEC and its allies may be phased out in 2019 in a way that won’t disturb the market, Saudi oil minister Khalid Al-Falih said. Still, U.S. supply remains a threat, with the nation’s rig count rising for a fifth week to the highest since April 2015.
Oil has risen more than 5 percent this year, following a second annual gain, as a drain in U.S. stockpiles and growing demand are reassuring investors that production cuts led by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are working. While America continues to pump record volumes, accompanied by an increase in exports, Al-Falih said the global oil market is re-balancing and bloated inventories are shrinking.
“Investors are likely looking at Libya for a potential reason for a rally in oil prices, but this shouldn’t last too long,” Barnabas Gan, an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., said by phone from Singapore. “Global oil fundamentals have been improving ever since OPEC and its allies agreed for production cuts, and the demand story is still supporting prices.”
West Texas Intermediate for April delivery added 25 cents to $63.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange as of 1:09 p.m. in Singapore. Prices on Friday rose 78 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $63.55, the highest in more than two weeks. Total volume traded was about the same as the 100-day average.
Brent for April settlement was up by 15 cents to $67.46 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contract on Friday climbed 92 cents, or 1.4 percent, to settle at $67.31. The global benchmark crude traded at a $3.67 premium to WTI.
Libyan Exports
Crude loadings at Melittah, the export terminal for El-Feel, will be slowed after force majeure was declared on deliveries from the deposit on Feb. 23 following protests over pay and other benefits, the state-run National Oil Corp. said in a document obtained by Bloomberg. Libya is an OPEC member which was allowed to increase production, exempt from the group’s effort to reduce output to eliminate a global glut.
The nations taking part in the supply curbs are currently studying what a crude re-balancing will entail, and will announce their next steps once that’s analyzed,, according to Saudi Arabia’s Al-Falih. While the group has agreed to prolong the cuts until the end of this year, “the framework beyond 2018 is yet to be determined, but for sure from the Saudi and from the OPEC standpoint, there is a determination to translate the success of 2017 and 2018,” he said in New Delhi on Saturday.
In the U.S., the number of rigs targeting oil increased by 1 to 799, the longest streak of gains in eight months, according to Baker Hughes data Friday.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 02:34AM ET</span>","After takeover by government, Anbang says committed to overseas subsidiaries","BEIJING (Reuters) - Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd said on Monday it fully supported the Chinese insurance regulator's decision to temporarily take control of the company, and remains committed to the development of its overseas subsidiaries.
These are the first comments by Anbang on the Chinese government's move on Friday to seize control of the company. ""We fully support CIRC’s decision,"" a company spokesman said, referring to the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), which announced the one-year takeover.
""We will continue to be committed to our overseas subsidiaries' business and investment, and will provide necessary support to their healthy development,"" the Anbang spokesman said.
The Chinese government's action on Anbang, along with the announcement that its chairman was being prosecuted for economic crimes, dramatically illustrated Beijing's willingness to curtail big-spending conglomerates as it cracks down on financial risk.
Analysts and lawyers do not think the maneuver heralds a coming wave of nationalizations, but said the sudden seizure of Anbang sent a strong message and raised questions about the future of its assets.
Anbang, which claims 1.97 trillion yuan ($310.85 billion) in assets and ranks 139 on the Global Fortune 500 list, had spent billions of dollars on overseas acquisitions in recent years, including $1.95 billion in 2015 for New York's landmark Waldorf Astoria hotel.
The once-aggressively acquisitive company later agreed to pay $6.5 billion for Strategic Hotels and Resorts.
In South Korea, Anbang also acquired  Tongyang Life  Insurance (KS:082640) in 2015, and later completed its acquisition of Allianz (DE:ALVG) Korea.
In Europe, Anbang Life acquired Vivat, the Dutch insurer in 2015, after buying Fidea insurance in Belgium a year earlier. The company also has acquired Retirement Concepts, the largest retirement home chain in British Columbia, Canada.
Sino-Ocean Group Holding Ltd (HK:3377), a property firm, said on Sunday it had received a written notice from Anbang saying the insurance group had no plans to alter its stake.
Anbang held 29.97 percent of Sino-Ocean Group as at June 30, 2017.
Anbang also has significant stakes in a slew of major Chinese companies and late on Friday some of the companies said they had received similar notices from Anbang assuring them that there would not be immediate stake sales.
Among them were  China Minsheng Banking  Corp Ltd (SS:600016) (HK:1988), China  Merchants Bank  Co Ltd (SS:600036) (HK:3968), developers  China Vanke  Co Ltd (SZ:000002) (HK:2202) and  Gemdale  Corp (SS:600383).
The Chinese crackdown on risk in the insurance sector continued over the weekend.

The CIRC said on Saturday it would force three major insurers - Ping An Insurance (Group) Co of China (SS:601318), New China Life Insurance (SS:601336) and China Re Asset Management Co - to take steps to deal with overseas investments that had violated regulations.

1313,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 12:00AM ET</span>",Chinese Stocks With `Emperor' in Their Names Are Surging,"(Bloomberg) -- What’s the trade on China’s move to let President Xi Jinping stay in power indefinitely? Some investors may have decided that it’s buying shares in companies with “king” or “emperor” in their names.
While stocks traded on China’s mainland largely tracked Friday’s advance in the U.S., firms like Shenzhen Emperor Technology Co. saw outsized gains, with the southern China-based maker of smart-card systems surging more than 9 percent on Monday, the most since the start of November. Trading volume in the stock also spiked, to over three times what it was on Friday.
Likewise, shares of Harbin Viti Electronics Co., which has a Chinese name that means “powerful emperor,” jumped more than 4 percent, and Vatti Corp., a stove and water heater manufacturer called “Chinese emperor” in Mandarin, was up more than 1 percent to a three-week high. The shortened name for Jiangxi Huangshanghuang Group Food Co., which climbed almost 3 percent, roughly translates as “king of kings.”
Even Shanghai Emperor of Cleaning Hi-Tech Co. got a boost, rising 2.6 percent compared with the benchmark index’s 0.7 percent climb.
Chinese investors have a history of betting on stocks because of their names. Traders in the $7.7 trillion market, which is dominated by mom-n-pop investors, flocked to a stock whose name sounded like “Trump Wins Big” to Mandarin speakers as the U.S. president secured victory in November 2016, while one called “Aunt Hillary” sold off.
When China said it would build a new economic area and city near the capital in April last year, companies with “Beijing,” “Development,” “Construction,” and even “Cement” in their names benefited.
The push to remove presidential term limits from China’s constitution would allow Xi to rule beyond 2023 and further cement his status as the country’s most powerful leader in decades.
Since the announcement on Sunday, social media has been weighing in with posters both lauding -- and lampooning -- the move, and some keying off the idea it would give Xi emperor-like status. The Communist Party congress in October had already elevated the president to a level that put him alongside the nation’s most vaunted political figures.

1314,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 25, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>",Three China Insurers Found Violating Investment Rules,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s insurance regulator found three domestic insurers violated foreign investment rules, giving the companies a month to “correct” the breaches.
China Re Asset Management Co., a unit of China Reinsurance Group Corp., New China Life Insurance Co. and Ping An Life Insurance Co. violated regulations on investable countries and regions, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission said in three separate notices posted on its website on Saturday dated Feb. 11. The statements didn’t give details on the breaches.
The notices follow China’s temporary takeover of debt-laden Anbang Insurance Group Co. on Friday and a series of clampdowns on acquisitive tycoons. The Anbang seizure was announced days before the ruling Communist Party was expected to meet behind closed doors to approve personnel appointments and government restructuring decisions.
The three insurers named on Saturday must report on steps taken to correct the breaches within one month from receiving the orders, according to the statements.
The move on Anbang furthered President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption and de-leveraging campaigns. The takeover signals the country’s determination to enforce regulations to support long-term growth rather than undisciplined rapid expansion, said Bloomberg Industry Analyst Steven Lam.

Under founder Wu Xiaohui, Anbang came to epitomize the voracious Chinese appetite for overseas acquisitions that saw trophy assets snapped up around the world. The full cost of that headlong spree started becoming clear last year as Chinese authorities, alarmed by mounting financial risks, slammed the brakes on Anbang and peers such as HNA Group.

U.S. monetary policy is expected to gather some attention later this week when the Federal Reserve’s new Chairman Jerome Powell speaks before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday and the Senate Banking Committee Thursday to give his first House testimony.
Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.9% by 9:30pm ET, with a weakening yen cited as a catalyst for the buying.

Meanwhile, the Communist Party of China moved to remove presidential term limits that would allow president Xi Jinping to rule beyond 2023. The announcement of the move came on Sunday, one week before this year’s National People’s Congress which is set to open on 5 March.
China’s home prices also received some attention as data out on Saturday suggested that the property market was steady in January but prices dipped in top tier cities, including Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai.
“The housing prices in tier-one cities reversed from growth to a decline and there was a slowdown in the growth rate in tier-two and -three cities,” said China Bureau of Statistics in a statement.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 26, 2018 11:26PM ET</span>",China's Geely raid on Daimler reignites German know-how fears,"By Michael Nienaber, Edward Taylor and Arno Schuetze
BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Automaker Geely's purchase of a $9 billion stake in Mercedes maker  Daimler  rekindled fears in Germany on Monday of its highly-prized expertise falling into Chinese hands.
Economy minister Brigitte Zypries stuck to Berlin's position that Geely's [GEELY.UL] swoop was a business matter, but said Germany's openness must not be not exploited by other countries.
Geely, which owns rival Swedish carmaker Volvo, is pushing Daimler for access to know-how in electric and autonomous cars.
On Wednesday, a German parliamentary committee will question government officials on whether Geely has violated disclosure rules and whether loopholes in securities trading law need to be closed, the Stuttgarter Zeitung and Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspaper reported on Tuesday. 
Germany tightened its rules on foreign takeovers last year, the first European Union country to do so, after a series of deals saw China gain access to high-tech know-how, while attempts by German companies to buy full control of Chinese rivals remains prohibited.
Although under German law, the government can only intervene if a threshold of 25 percent is exceeded, investors must abide by market rules, Zypries said in interviews with Daimler's home-town newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung and Handelsblatt newspaper.
Geely revealed its 9.7 percent stake in Daimler (DE:DAIGn) on Friday, surprising the market as it had not disclosed having crossed regulatory thresholds of 3 and 5 percent.
Financial and markets regulator Bafin, which oversees the proper disclosure of stakes said it was investigating whether there had been any breach of disclosure rules, which can result in fines of 10 million euros or more.
The Chinese carmaker first approached Daimler in November and asked it to issue shares so it could buy a stake, as well as for access to battery technology to help set up an electric car joint venture in Wuhan, China.
Daimler, which employs 289,000 people, declined to do a deal as it had reservations about a new industrial alliance for fear of alienating its existing Chinese joint venture partner BAIC (HK:1958), a person familiar with the carmaker's thinking said.
Daimler and BAIC on Sunday said they were planning to co-invest more than 11.9 billion yuan ($1.88 billion) to build a new local production base.
""Daimler has already rejected Geely’s overtures once, and Daimler execs we spoke with argue it’s simply not clear what Geely could offer Mercedes,"" Bernstein Research analyst Robin Zhu said in a note.
STEALTH RAID 
Geely responded to the rejection in November by enlisting Dirk Notheis, the former Chief Executive of  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) in Germany and Yi Bao, a former CEO of Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Notheis, who declined comment, and Yi Bao, who could not be reached, devised a way for Geely to build a significant stake in Daimler using aggressive takeover tactics which German regulators had sought to quash.
Geely worked with Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), which declined to comment on Monday, to help secure a 9.69 percent voting stake using derivatives to help skirt disclosure requirements, two people familiar with the deal told Reuters.
Mercedes-Benz executives in Stuttgart were at first caught off guard by the approach, but welcomed Geely in meetings on Monday to see how to ""constructively discuss"" industry changes.
Zhejian Geely Holding also owns several other carmakers including Sweden's Volvo Cars, London's black-cab maker LEVC and its own Geely Automobile Holdings (HK:0175). It has agreed to buy a $3.3 billion stake in Volvo Trucks.
KNOCK-ON IMPACT
The first sign of wider ramifications from Geely's move on Daimler surfaced on Monday as Volvo Trucks dropped the chief executive of Geely's Volvo Cars from its board, citing competition concerns with rival Daimler.
And EU trade ministers will meet this week to discuss a range of issues including how better to protect strategically important European companies from unwanted investors.
Germany's DIHK chambers of industry and commerce representing 3.6 million companies in Europe's largest economy welcomed Geely's actions.
""In principle, it is an honor that foreign investors take interest in German companies,"" Volker Treier, the DIHK's head of foreign trade was quoted by Stuttgarter Zeitung and Stuttgarter Nachrichten as saying. 
Several major deals during 2017 raised German sensitivities about multi-billion euro foreign takeovers, notably Chinese home appliance maker Midea Group (SZ:000333) buying German robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G), and Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing's buying German metering firm Ista.[L8N1QG3VD]
""The events of last Friday are the latest demonstrations of China's growing confidence and assertiveness, growing desire to impose its will on global affairs, and growing willingness to exploit the German OEMs' heavy reliance on Chinese profits,"" Bernstein Research said.

The Chinese government on Friday seized control of Anbang and said its chairman had been prosecuted, illustrating Beijing's willingness to curtail big-spending conglomerates as it cracks down on financial risk.
Anbang had violated laws and regulations which ""may seriously endanger the solvency of the company"", the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said in a statement announcing the seizure, without giving details.
Sino-Ocean Group said it had received a written notice from Anbang saying the insurance group had no plans to alter its stake in the property firm.
""Currently, our company and its subordinate entities are in stable operation, with sufficient cash reserves, and there are no recent plans to reduce the shareholding in your company,"" Sino-Ocean Group cited the Anbang notice as saying.
Sino-Ocean Group also said the company did not expect the CIRC's control of Anbang to have any adverse impact on its operations and business.

Anbang held 29.97 percent of Sino-Ocean Group as at June 30, 2017, the second-largest shareholder following China Life (SS:601628) which owned a 29.98 percent stake according to Sino-Ocean Group's website.

1319,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2018 08:20PM ET</span>",Few phone makers will survive industry's brutal economics: Huawei,"By Paul Sandle
BARCELONA (Reuters) - The smartphone industry is bound to consolidate as the heavy investments required to remain competitive mean that, in the long-run, only a handful of firms can make money, the consumer chief of China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] said on Sunday. 
Richard Yu, chief executive of Huawei's consumer business group, said anyone at this stage in the decade-old industry's history that had less than 10 percent market share was losing money.
Huawei is the world's third biggest smartphone maker, trailing leaders Samsung (KS:005930) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with a 10.2 percent market share in the fourth quarter, according to market surveys from IDC and Strategy Analytics.
""In the future, only three to four vendors can survive, maybe only less than four,"" Yu told reporters following a product launch event held ahead of the Mobile World Congress.
He said other, smaller Chinese vendors were consolidating, and most would disappear, as they did not have enough resources to invest in the same levels of research and development, marketing and branding needed to gain global scale. 
""If your market share is less than 10 percent you cannot be profitable. Over at 10 percent, at least, you can break even (and) over 15 percent you can make money,"" he said.
He said Huawei's smartphone business grew by around 30 percent in the last year, and would grow even faster this year, with strong growth in both January and so far this month.
Huawei could become the second biggest smartphone maker this year or next, and sooner or later could be No.1, he said, speaking after his company unveiled a new notebook PC and two Android tablets. 
It declined to launch a new flagship smartphone as it has done in the past at the Mobile World conference in Barcelona. Instead, it is set to launch its new flagship P20 smartphone at a standalone event in Paris next month, where Yu said Huawei would showcase ""big and bold"" innovation in camera technology.
The device will compete head-to-head with Samsung's new Galaxy S9 - launched here on Sunday - and Apple's iPhone X.
Looking ahead to next generation mobile networks set to roll out starting later this year in several major markets, Huawei also unveiled 5G versions of a consumer network router, its own chipset for phones.

Yu said Huawei will launch its first 5G-ready smartphone either in the third- or fourth-quarter, most likely in its Mate line of devices.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares made guarded gains on Monday as investors braced for an event-packed week headlined by U.S. inflation data and the first House testimony by the new head of the Federal Reserve.
Spread betters also pointed to a stronger start for Europe and FTSE futures were already 0.5 percent higher.
But sentiment was fragile, with the dollar reversing its early rise and safe-haven bonds firming as E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 turned flat.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan crept up 0.6 percent, with most bourses in the green.
Japan's Nikkei led with an increase of 1.3 percent, while Chinese blue chips added 0.7 percent.
China's ruling Communist Party on Sunday set the stage for President Xi Jinping to stay in office indefinitely, with a proposal to remove a constitutional clause limiting presidential service to just two terms in office.
Investors initially took heart from Friday's rally on Wall Street which saw the VIX volatility index end at 16.49 percent, far below the 50 percent peak touched at the height of market turmoil in early February.
The mood has calmed partly thanks to expectations the Federal Reserve will stay gradual in its tightening, a measured outlook underlined by the central bank in a governors' report released on Friday.
Investors also seem to be wagering that Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will stick to that script at his first appearance before the House on Tuesday, followed by testimony to the Senate on Thursday. 
""Powell will be highly cognizant of the spike in risk aversion in late January and will be keen not to rock the boat too greatly,"" argued Chris Weston, chief market strategist at broker IG.
""Futures markets on Friday were pricing in less implied policy tightening from the Fed in the years ahead, suggesting traders are not expecting Powell to signal a more aggressive response.""
WARY ON INFLATION
Yields on U.S. 10-year Treasuries had also backed off to 2.85 percent and away from a four-year top of 2.957 percent.
An added wrinkle is that the Fed's favored measure of inflation, the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index, is out early on Thursday. 
Markets will be hyper-sensitive to any hint of a pick-up in core inflation given the surprising strength of wages in January and Powell is certain to be questioned on the risks by Senators.
In currency markets, the U.S. dollar surrendered early gains to dip 0.2 percent on a basket of currencies to 89.730. That followed a 0.8 percent bounce last week.
It also retreated on the yen to reach 106.66, failing to hold an early 107.28 top amid selling by Japanese exporters for month-end.
The euro was firmer at $1.2314, just above last week's trough at $1.2258, with ECB President Mario Draghi set to appear before the European Parliament later in the day.
Dealers were also looking ahead to the outcome of the Italian general election on March 4.
A German Social Democrats' poll of its members on joining another coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives is also due that day, two big political risk events for markets.
In commodities, the lapse in the dollar helped spot gold bounce 0.6 percent to $1,336.94 per ounce.
Oil prices extended gains to hit their highest level in nearly three weeks on Monday, supported by comments from Saudi Arabia that it would continue to curb exports in line with the OPEC-led effort to cut global supplies. 

U.S. crude futures added 25 cents to $63.80 a barrel, while Brent futures rose 15 cents to $67.46.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  (N:GE), the United States' largest industrial conglomerate, will restate its earnings for 2016 and 2017 as it adopts a new accounting standard, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.
The updated accounting standard, which will take into account revenue from long-term contracts, will result in a 13 cent cut in reported earnings per share for 2016 and a cut of 16 cents per share for 2017, according to the company's 10-K filing.
GE is adopting the new accounting standards as the Securities and Exchange Commission investigates the company over its accounting for long-term service contracts.
The changes also come as the company struggles to reverse steep declines in some of its businesses and is looking to sell off $20 billion of assets. 
It will restate earnings when it reports 2018 results, GE said in the filing. GE reports first-quarter earnings on April 20.
GE is also facing potential legal action by the U.S. Department of Justice over allegations that its GE Capital unit and now-defunct WMC Mortgage Corp unit violated U.S. law in connection with subprime mortgages, according to Friday's filing.
In January, the company reported a $10 billion loss in the quarter, hurt by a $6.2 billion charge to increase insurance reserves, and steep declines in profit in its power and transportation divisions.
Over the last year, GE's stock has fallen more than 51 percent and is trading around $14.49.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2018 01:25PM ET</span>",Boeing to have 51 percent stake in venture with Embraer: paper,"BRASILIA (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) will have a 51 percent stake in a joint company currently being negotiated with Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer (SA:EMBR3), O Globo newspaper columnist Lauro Jardim reported on Sunday.
Boeing has agreed to a Brazilian government demand that the U.S. company have no more than a 51 percent controlling share, Jardim said, without citing sources.
Embraer said it would not comment on the matter. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment. 
Boeing has sought Brazilian government approval of the partnership with Embraer that would create a new company focused on commercial aviation, excluding Embraer's defense unit, Reuters reported three weeks ago.
The Valor Economico newspaper later reported that Boeing's proposal would give it an 80 percent to 90 percent stake in a new commercial jet business with Embraer.
Embraer is the world's third largest planemaker and the leader in the 70-seat to 130-seat regional jet market.
With the proposed tie-up Boeing would be the market leader in the smaller passenger jet market, creating stiffer competition for the CSeries aircraft program designed by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) and backed by European rival Airbus SE (PA:AIR).
Boeing's initial plan to buy Embraer was rejected by the Brazilian government because it did not want a foreign company to control its defense unit for strategic security reasons.
The government maintains a so-called golden share in Embraer, a former state enterprise, that gives it veto power over strategic decisions, including Boeing's push for a tie-up.

On Thursday Brazilian Defense Minister Raul Jungmann told reporters that Boeing had understood Brazil's refusal to give up control of Embraer. He said negotiations on the creation of a third company were advancing well.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major privacy rights fight between  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and the Justice Department reaches the Supreme Court this week, with the justices considering whether U.S. law allows prosecutors to compel technology companies to hand over data stored overseas.
The nine justices will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations. 
The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.
The case is being closely watched by other countries wrestling with similar concerns, including members of the European Union. A ruling is due by the end of June.
A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump's administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.
Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government's reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.
Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.
Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, told reporters last week the U.S. government should not be able to act unilaterally to access such data without taking into account the laws and interests of other countries.
""It's more likely to be a recipe for international tension and chaos,"" Smith said. 
Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the administration's top lawyer in Supreme Court cases, said in court papers that a ruling for Microsoft ""would hamper domestic law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.""
If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Microsoft, the government could still gain access data held overseas, but the process would be more cumbersome and potentially take longer. 
Lawmakers are considering making changes to the 1986 law. 
Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.
BEYOND REACH
Though Microsoft is based in the United States - Redmond, Washington, to be precise - the appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.
The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.
Other companies including  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Corp, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Google has mounted challenges similar to Microsoft's.
The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont who say they routinely seek access to data stored overseas, especially in cases involving child pornography. 
Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government's position.
Ireland's government said in its brief that the question of how law enforcement authorities can access such information is already covered by a 2001 treaty with the United States that allows for information sharing and enforcement of court orders.
The treaty's procedures ""represent the most appropriate means to address requests such as those which are the object of the warrant in question,"" Ireland's brief said.
The European Commission, representing the 28-country European Union, filed a brief saying that when a country is seeking data from outside its jurisdiction ""the interests and laws of that foreign jurisdiction must be taken into account.""
The Supreme Court has ruled twice in recent years in major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. In 2014, the court ruled that police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest.

In the court's current term, which ends in June, the justices are due to rule on another privacy issue on whether police need search warrants to access cellphone location information held by wireless carriers. Based on the Nov. 29 oral argument, the justices appear likely to rule against law enforcement again.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",Major firms learning to adapt in fight against start-ups: IBM,"By Paul Sandle
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Major corporations are learning to defend against start-ups that threaten their business models, hitting back by adopting the disruptors' playbook, according to a survey of top executives by computer services firm  IBM  (NYSE:IBM).
The proportion of executives who thought competitors were set to flood into their industry has halved from 54 percent to 26 percent compared to two years ago, the broad-based poll of business decision-makers showed.
""There's been a feeling historically that the elephants can't dance, the incumbents will find it hard to respond and that everyone will be Uber-ed or Airbnb-ed out of existence,"" Mark Foster, senior vice president of IBM Global Business Services, told Reuters in an interview.
""But what we are seeing is actually there is a limit as to how far that can go.""
While some sectors had been hugely disrupted by new digital entrants and some intermediaries pushed out, many of those changes were now being led by existing industry players, he said.
Disruption is a catch-all term for the use of digital technology to up-end existing business models, for example Uber's impact on the taxi industry by using smartphones to connect riders with drivers, and pricing according to demand.
But just 27 percent of the executives surveyed said they were experiencing significant disruption, an unexpected finding given the deluge many predicted, IBM said. Only 23 percent said the big drivers of change were from outside their industries.
Digital giants, like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), continued to concentrate their power in some industries, but according to the executives surveyed they were not leading the disruption, and start-ups were increasingly quiescent, the survey found.
Instead, 72 percent said it was the most innovative incumbents who were leading the disruption, including in industries targeted by start-ups such as financial services.
IBM said the incumbents had become better at spotting and acquiring nascent disruptors. They had also realized the need to find partners, even sharing physical assets and people with them, to acquire new skills.
They are investing in the technologies that facilitate the sharing of data across organizations - such as the Internet of Things, which bridges physical and digital assets, and blockchain.
""Disruption hasn't gone underground,"" IBM said in its report released before the start of the mobile industry's biggest event, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.
""Instead, it's emerging as a capability incumbents are ready to embrace.""
IBM surveyed 12,854 top executives, such as chief executives and finance directors, from 112 countries for its report.
""Who Says Elephants Can't Dance"" was the title of the memoir of 1990s era IBM CEO Lou Gerstner, who is credited with bringing the company back from a near-death experience by shifting it into software and services and exiting most hardware businesses.

The two will invest more than 11.9 billion yuan ($1.88 billion) in modernizing a plant to build premium Mercedes-Benz cars including electric vehicles, BAIC said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dated Friday and confirmed by Daimler on Sunday.
The chairman of Chinese carmaker Geely said late on Friday he had bought an almost 10 percent stake in Daimler, in a $9 billion bet to access the Mercedes-Benz owner's technology.
The move poses a challenge to Daimler, which as well as its Chinese partnership with BAIC Motor Corporation has an industrial alliance to develop cars and trucks with Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA), which owns a 3.1 percent stake in Daimler.
Geely's Chairman Li Shufu, who quietly built up the 9.7 percent stake, is now expected to meet Daimler executives in Stuttgart on Monday, a source familiar with the matter said, and hopes to meet top German government officials in Berlin.
His approach contrasts with that of previous Chinese investors in German technology companies - such as Midea (SZ:000333), which bought  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) or Weichai (SZ:000338), which bought a large stake in Kion (DE:KGX) - who have tended to engage in lengthy consultation with stakeholders.
Berlin said it saw no need to take any action over Geely's purchase, either in terms of competition rules or of foreign investment rules.
""It is a company decision,"" a government spokesman said. ""Due to the character of the investment as a minority stake, there is no need to act.""
The government declined to comment on a report in German tabloid Bild am Sonnntag that Li would visit the German chancellery for a ""secret meeting"" with Angela Merkel's economic adviser on Tuesday.
Daimler also declined to comment on any possible meetings with Li.
Geely said it wants an alliance with Daimler, which is developing electric and self-driving vehicles and is the only German carmaker not to be controlled by a family, to respond to the challenge from new rivals such as Tesla (O:TSLA) and Uber.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 25, 2018 12:31AM ET</span>","Delta, United Airlines become latest companies to cut NRA ties","By Gina Cherelus
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines and United Airlines on Saturday became the latest major corporations to sever marketing ties with the National Rifle Association as the fallout from last week's massacre at a Florida high school took its toll on the gun advocacy group.
The exodus of corporate names, ranging from a major insurer to car rental brands and a household moving company, began after the NRA launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun laws.
The NRA responded by saying its members were being punished, but would not be intimidated, by what it called ""a shameful display of political and civic cowardice"" from some corporations.
In tweets on Saturday, Delta (N:DAL) and United [UALCO.UL]said they were no longer offering NRA members discounted rates and they would ask the NRA to remove their information from its website.
The issue of gun control, and the NRA's role in opposing it, became the focus of renewed national debate after a former student killed 17 people on Feb. 14 at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland, using an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally.
NRA spokespeople have lashed out at gun control advocates, arguing that Democratic elites are politicizing the deadly rampage in Florida to erode gun owners' rights. 
In a statement on Saturday, the NRA said its more than five million law-abiding members had nothing to do with the failures of school security, the mental health system, or both local and federal law enforcement that it said had caused the tragedy.
""Despite that, some corporations have decided to punish NRA membership in a shameful display of political and civic cowardice,"" the statement said. ""In time, these brands will be replaced by others who recognize that patriotism and determined commitment to Constitutional freedoms are characteristics of a marketplace they very much want to serve.""
The attrition of NRA corporate partners began on Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs, and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA's contract to issue a co-branded Visa card. 
By Friday, the list of defectors grew to include  Symantec Corp  (O:SYMC), which ended a discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product. Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs.
Chubb Ltd (N:CB) said it would stop underwriting a NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Another insurer, MetLife Inc (N:MET), also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members. And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its affiliate relationship with the NRA.

The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The NRA, which has long used campaign donations and effective lobbying to command political influence, argues that stricter gun control would erode individual rights.

Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said its request to makers of the military-style weapons was in line with those taken by other financial industry companies to help prevent deadly gun rampages.
""An immediate step we're taking is to engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for non-military use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility,"" the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said in a statement.
It did not name the clients who make assault rifles. The weapons have been widely used in U.S. mass shootings, including the one on Feb. 14 that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.
The Bank of America move came after BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), the world's biggest asset manager, said on Thursday it would speak with weapons manufacturers and distributors ""to understand their response"" to the high school massacre.

The First National Bank of Omaha has said it will not renew a contract with the National Rifle Association to issue a NRA-branded Visa card. The lender was among several corporate partners that have cut marketing ties with the powerful gun lobby in recent days.

The company has received a total of 3.8 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in loans from the EIB since 2000, with around 2 billion still outstanding, the newspaper said.
""The EIB is worried about the accusations against Daimler and their potential consequences for the bank's credit financing of the company,"" an EIB spokesman said in an article published on Sunday.
The news comes after Bild am Sonntag reported last week U.S. investigators had found that Daimler's cars were equipped with software that may have helped them pass emissions tests. 
Daimler said it was cooperating with the U.S. authorities and had agreed upon strict confidentiality with the Department of Justice. It has not been charged with anything by the U.S. authorities.
The EIB said it would need to wait for the outcome of official investigations before deciding whether Daimler should repay the loans, the newspaper said.
A Daimler spokesman told Reuters it had received a request for information from the EIB and was cooperating with the bank. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) was found in 2015 to have illegally installed software ""defeat devices"" to dupe U.S. regulatory tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history. It settled the principal U.S. cases for $25 billion the following year, although a host of others are still pending.
The Daimler spokesman declined to comment on the amount of outstanding loans from the EIB, while the bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Since 2009, the EIB has granted more than 8 billion euros ($10 billion) in preferential loans to back development of vehicles with lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by carmakers, including VW.

In France, the bank has asked investigators to find out whether 800 million euros of EU-backed loans to French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) could have been used to develop test-cheating diesel engines, according to documents seen by Reuters.

(Reuters) - A giant hurricane, earthquake or other conflagration inflicting unprecedented, catastrophic damage is likely at some point to strike the United States.
Warren Buffett says: Bring it on.
In his annual letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc, Buffett said ""no company comes close"" to his conglomerate in its ability to financially withstand even a mega-catastrophe that causes $400 billion of insurance losses.
Buffett said the odds of such a catastrophe in any year is just 2 percent, but that Berkshire would lose only about $12 billion, a sum more than offset by annual profits from its non-insurance businesses.
""Concurrently, much - indeed, perhaps most - of the p/c world would be out of business,"" he wrote, referring to property and casualty insurers.
""Our unparalleled financial strength explains why other p/c insurers come to Berkshire – and only Berkshire – when they, themselves, need to purchase huge reinsurance coverages for large payments they may have to make in the far future.""
Berkshire entered insurance in 1967 when it paid $8.6 million for reinsurer National Indemnity Co and an affiliate.
The sector has since been the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's main driver of growth, even as Buffett expanded into railroads, chemicals, energy, industrial products, newspapers, candy and ice cream, underwear and other businesses.
Berkshire's many insurance operations also include the Geico auto insurer and General Re reinsurer.
Longtime insurance executive Ajit Jain has been in charge of overseeing coverage against giant or unusual risks.
In January, Berkshire named Jain a vice chairman overseeing insurance operations, cementing his status as a possible successor to Buffett as Berkshire's chief executive.
Last year was difficult for Berkshire in insurance underwriting, where it lost $3.24 billion before taxes and $2.22 billion after taxes, its first full-year loss since 2002.
Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as California wildfires, were key culprits, and the $3 billion pretax cost for the hurricanes disappointed some analysts because of their size.
Even Geico lost $310 million before taxes from underwriting, despite boosting premiums by 16 percent and policies-in-force by 9 percent. Its underwriting loss was $188 million in the fourth quarter. 
Berkshire had made money from underwriting even in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina struck the U.S. Gulf Coast.
That storm at the time caused $41.1 billion of U.S. insured losses, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
Nonetheless, insurance helps fund Berkshire's growth by providing Buffett with float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, that he can invest.
Float totaled $114.5 billion at the end of December, and Buffett said it will ""probably increase slowly for at least a few years.""
As he often does in his letters, Buffett praised his managers for keeping insurance growth on track, calling their work ""conservative and careful"" despite the occasional hiccup.

""What counts are brains and capital,"" he wrote. ""The managers of our various insurance companies supply the brains and Berkshire provides the capital.""

In its annual report, Berkshire said the increase, to $18.2 billion, was made in the fourth quarter, and was based on higher-than-expected loss payments reported by AIG.
Berkshire also boosted a related deferred charge asset by $1.7 billion, and estimated its year-end net liability under the contract was $10.7 billion.
The January 2017 contract called for Berkshire's National Indemnity Co to take on many of the long-term risks in AIG's property and casualty portfolio, sometimes known as ""long-tail"" exposure, in exchange for $10.2 billion upfront.
National Indemnity agreed to take on 80 percent of net losses in excess of the first $25 billion, with a maximum liability of $20 billion.
The contract reduced potential risks for New York-based AIG, and some analysts said soon after it was announced that the pricing terms appeared fair. 
At the same time, the $10.2 billion payment boosted Berkshire's insurance ""float,"" which reflects premiums received before claims are paid, and gave Buffett more money to invest.

Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska.

The Norwegian fund is seeking permission to broaden its investments to include unlisted companies, and has in the past lamented its inability to make early investments in fast-growing companies such as Uber [UBER.UL] or Airbnb.
""There are many successful medium-sized companies in Germany that are not listed. Until now we could not invest in these firms because we did not have permission from the Norwegian government. We hope that will change this year,"" Slyngstad said in an interview published on Saturday.
""When you look at our investments relative to the economic power of the country, you can see that we have pent-up demand.""
Slyngstad was also asked whether the Norwegian fund would invest in the planned $100 billion listing of Saudi national oil firm Saudi Aramco, given that the fund was considering stopping oil and gas investments.
He declined to comment, but added: ""I think it's clear to many people that our exposure to oil is already very extensive.""

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2018 01:12PM ET</span>","With $116 billion cash, Buffett says Berkshire needs 'huge' deals","By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday lamented his inability to find big companies to buy and said his goal is to make ""one or more huge acquisitions"" of non-insurance businesses to bolster results at his conglomerate  Berkshire Hathaway Inc . (NYSE:BRKa)
In his annual letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said finding things to buy at a ""sensible purchase price"" has become a challenge and is a major reason Berkshire is awash with $116 billion of low-yielding cash and government bonds.
Buffett said a ""purchasing frenzy"" binge by deal-hungry chief executives employing cheap debt has made that task difficult. Berkshire typically pays all cash for acquisitions.
""Our smiles will broaden when we have redeployed Berkshire's excess funds into more productive assets,"" Buffett wrote. ""Berkshire's goal is to substantially increase the earnings of its non-insurance group. For that to happen, we will need to make one or more huge acquisitions.""
The letter was considerably shorter than in recent years, a little over 8,000 words compared with more than 14,000 last year, and did not discuss major Berkshire stock holdings such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. Buffett often invests in stocks when he cannot find whole companies to buy.
It was also short on faulting excesses of Wall Street and Washington, and said nothing about Berkshire's plan to create a healthcare company with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).
At age 87, ""he doesn't want to make any enemies,"" said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, a Berkshire investor.
Berkshire also posted a record $44.94 billion annual profit, though $29.1 billion stemmed from the slashing of the U.S. corporate tax rate, which reduced the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate's deferred tax liabilities. Book value per share, measuring assets minus liabilities, rose 23 percent in 2017.
ABEL, JAIN
It has been more than two years since Buffett made a major purchase, the $32.1 billion takeover of aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp, and his advancing age gives him less time to find more of the ""elephants"" he prefers.
But he has given himself and longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, more freedom to focus on investing and allocating capital.
Neither has signaled any intention of stepping down soon, though Berkshire last month named two additional vice chairmen who could eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
Gregory Abel, who had run Berkshire Hathaway Energy, is now overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream, all of which employ 330,000 people, while insurance specialist Ajit Jain oversee the Geico auto insurer and other insurance businesses, employing 47,000.
""Berkshire's blood flows through their veins,"" Buffett wrote.
APPLE
While the Wells Fargo investment has struggled in recent months because of scandals over how it treats customers, Apple has performed better.
Buffett revealed in his letter that Berkshire was sitting at year end on a $7.25 billion paper profit on what has become a 3.3 percent stake in the iPhone maker, worth $28.2 billion.
Some Berkshire stock investments are made by deputies Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who Buffett said together manage about $25 billion, up from $21 billion a year ago.
Buffett also warned long-term investors including pension funds, college endowments and ""savings-minded individuals"" that even with U.S. stock prices near record highs, it would be a ""terrible mistake"" to assume bonds are safer.
""Often, high-grade bonds in an investment portfolio increase its risk,"" he wrote.
Fourth-quarter net income quintupled to $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, from $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier.
Operating profit, which Buffett considers a better gauge of performance, fell more than analysts expected in the fourth quarter, and slid 18 percent for the year to $14.46 billion.
Full-year results suffered from Berkshire's first full-year insurance underwriting loss since 2002, hurt by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and wildfires in California.

Even so, insurance float, or premiums collected before claims are paid, and which give Buffett more money to invest, rose 25 percent last year, to $114.5 billion.

The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) has revised its rules for foreign banks, scrapping approval procedures in four areas including overseas wealth management products and portfolio investment funds, the report said. 
The new policies became effective on Feb. 13, it said.
The changes mean foreign banks will now only need to report their services to authorities rather than obtaining approval in advance, while steps have been simplified for setting up new branches, appointing executives and issuing bonds.
The commission has also clarified the procedures and application documents for foreign-funded banks to invest in domestic banking institutions, the report said. 
CBRC in December issued draft measures for easing market access for foreign lenders, and cutting red tape to create a level playing field for such activities as branch openings, debt fundraising and examination of senior executives.
The rules announced on Saturday appear to be a confirmation of the draft measures, although this was not confirmed.
In November, Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said the country would raise the foreign ownership limit in some joint-venture firms in the futures, securities and fund markets to 51 percent from the current 49 percent. The plan has yet to be implemented. 
A month earlier, CBRC Chairman Guo Shuqing said China was preparing to further open up its banking system to foreign investors. 

Foreign banks' market share has halved to 1.2 percent in the past 10 years, Guo said, which ""is not beneficial for promoting competition"".

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2018 10:07AM ET</span>",Trump tax cut fuels record profit for Buffett's Berkshire,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Saturday reported a record quarterly and annual profit, fueled by a big cut in the U.S. corporate income tax rate championed by President Donald Trump.
Fourth-quarter net income increased roughly fivefold to $32.55 billion, or $19,790 per Class A share, from $6.29 billion, or $3,823 per share, a year earlier.
Quarterly operating profit for the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate fell 24 percent to $3.34 billion from $4.38 billion.
Berkshire attributed roughly $29.11 billion of its net income to the reduction of the corporate tax rate, to 21 percent from 35 percent, that Trump signed into law in December. Many U.S. companies' reported results have been skewed by the law's impact.
""Buffett has been quick to say that he thinks that the tax policy changes were going to help Berkshire and be positive overall,"" said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, a Berkshire shareholder. ""It is a bit ironic his candidate would not have any interest in this whatsoever."" 
Buffett supported Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. ""Buffett doesn't dwell very long on the politics,"" Smead said.
Book value per Class A share, which reflects assets minus liabilities and which Buffett considers a good yardstick for Berkshire's intrinsic worth, also benefited from the tax cut, rising 13 percent in the fourth quarter to $211,750.
For all of 2017, Berkshire's net income rose 87 percent to $44.94 billion. Operating profit, however, fell 18 percent to $14.46 billion, hurt by a rare loss from insurance underwriting.

Berkshire's Class A shares closed at $304,020.01 on Friday, and its Class B shares closed at $202.76. Both are up a little over 2 percent this year, but are down nearly 7 percent from their record highs set on Jan. 29.

In three separate statements, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) said investments abroad by Ping An Insurance (Group) Co of China (SS:601318), New China Life Insurance (SS:601336) and China Re Asset Management Co had broken official rules published in 2012.
It did not elaborate on the wrongdoings.
The orders came after the government on Friday seized control of Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd [ANBANG.UL] and said its chairman had been prosecuted.
Chinese insurers are allowed to make investments in 25 developed markets, including the United States and Singapore, as well as 20 emerging markets such as Brazil and Indonesia, state media Xinhua said in a report, citing CIRC rules on overseas investment of insurance funds.
The firms must make the necessary adjustments and report their changes within a month, the CIRC said in the statements.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Mehul Choksi, one of two businessmen allegedly involved in perpetrating India's biggest ever banking fraud, broke his silence at the weekend with an open letter to employees claiming his innocence and telling them to look for other jobs. 
Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi, both owners of jewelry store chains, are suspected of colluding with two employees from  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK), the country's second-largest state lender, in an alleged $1.8 billion fraud. 
The businessmen are said to have been issued with illegal letters of undertaking (LOUs) from PNB over a seven year period, and to have used them to get loans from overseas branches of other, mostly Indian banks. 
Choksi, who owns  Gitanjali Gems  (NS:GTGM), told employees he did not want anyone to suffer due to an association with him, but that he was in no position to pay their salaries and they were free to look for other opportunities until he could prove himself innocent.
""With recent false allegations leveled against me of defrauding the PNB Bank and media frenzy, the situation has gone grave, which is turning graver by the day,"" Choksi wrote in the letter sent to employees on Friday.
The scandal, which came to light earlier this month, has shaken confidence in state-run lenders and turned the spotlight again on India's deep-seated corruption problem. 
At least a dozen people -- six from the bank and six more from Modi's and Choksi's companies -- have been arrested and the investigation is still continuing.
Modi, who according to Forbes magazine has a net worth of some $1.8 billion, owns Firestar International and a chain of eponymous boutique stores from New York to Beijing.
On Saturday, authorities seized a farmhouse, a solar power plant and land that belonged to him.
Also on Saturday, India's Enforcement Directorate, which fights financial crimes, said on Twitter it had taken possession of 21 other properties belonging to Modi worth 5.24 billion rupees ($81 million) in the latest swoop in Mumbai and Pune, another city in western India.
Earlier in the week, the agency said it had seized luxury cars worth millions of rupees belonging to Modi.
A lawyer for Modi has denied his client was involved in any fraud. 
Choksi's firm, Gitanjali Gems (NS:GTGM), has also denied involvement in the alleged fraud.
Separately, India's federal police on Thursday registered a case against a Delhi-based jeweler on a fraud complaint filed by Oriental Bank of Commerce, another state-owned bank, a police source said.
The lender has alleged the firm, Dwarka Das Seth International, cheated the bank with the help of some of its officials, using letters of credit (LCs) — a loan instrument similar to those used by Modi's and Choksi's firms in the alleged fraud.
Reuters was unable to reach the Delhi firm as the phone numbers listed online did not work.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A company behind U.S.-based funds tied to Wall Street's ""fear gauge"" is making changes to its investment strategy after a sudden market plunge this month routed traders betting on the complex instrument.
Investors' once-profitable wagers on low or stable market volatility met a catastrophic end on Feb. 5 as products indirectly linked to that fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, caved after the U.S. stock market closed in an incident now being probed by securities regulators.
Two exchange-traded products that effectively bet on low volatility shut after shedding most of their value earlier this month, including the  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG-issued VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Note, but others stayed on the market and attracted new demand from investors despite major losses of their own.
REX Shares LLC, which sponsors two volatility-linked products, on Friday announced adjusting those funds so they invest in a different set of underlying instruments than they had before.
In a statement, the company, founded and run by Credit Suisse and VelocityShares veteran Greg King, suggested the changes to the REX VolMAXX Long VIX Weekly Futures Strategy ETF and REX VolMAXX Short VIX Weekly Futures Strategy ETF would make the products less volatile.
The tweaks are technical. The funds' manager will now invest primarily in futures contracts linked to VIX with two to six months to expire, according to the statement, up from less than one month. The funds will likely also ""reduce their exposure"" to volatility-linked products managed by other companies, the statement said. The changes are due to take effect by April 25.
REX declined to comment beyond the statement and a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
It remains to be seen how the changes, the first substantive adjustments made to such a product's strategy since the turmoil two weeks ago, will be received.
The tweaks respond to a concern that volatility products' demand for short-term VIX futures exhausted the market's liquidity on Feb. 5, pushing prices up and exacerbating losses for traders betting on those contracts falling in value.
Fidelity recently prevented clients from buying some volatility-linked products ""to protect customers from outsized risk during the current market environment,"" the company said in a statement at the time.
A commissioner at the SEC, Kara Stein, on Friday questioned the use of volatility-linked products, saying ""the question should be...not can we create complex and esoteric products, but should we?""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) faces potential legal action by the U.S. Department of Justice over allegations that its GE Capital unit and now-defunct WMC Mortgage Corp unit violated U.S. law in connection with subprime mortgages, according to a regulatory filing on Friday.
The DOJ ""is likely to assert"" violation of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) ""in connection with WMC's origination and sale of subprime mortgage loans in 2006 and 2007,"" the filing said.
""WMC and GE Capital will explore whether an acceptable settlement of this matter can be reached. In the event that an acceptable settlement cannot be reached, DOJ may initiate legal proceedings against WMC and GE Capital. WMC and GE Capital believe they would have defenses to any such lawsuit,"" GE's 10-K filing added.
GE said the warning about the potential action stems from a DOJ investigation and outcomes of investigations of other financial firms. GE said two years ago that the DOJ had issued subpoenas to WMC and GE Capital as part of an industry-wide investigation.
WMC, now a defunct subprime lending unit, was sold by GE in 2007.
GE declined to elaborate beyond the language in the filing.
The Boston-based conglomerate also said in the filing that it added 18,000 employees to its worldwide workforce last year, a 6.1 percent increase that comes as it tries to cut costs to raise profits.
GE said it had 313,000 employees at year-end, including 106,000 in the United States.
The increase stemmed from acquisitions made last year, including  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE) and LM Wind Power, and was ""offset by divestitures and restructuring,"" GE spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said. 
""The headcount figures at the end of 2017 do not reflect all of the restructuring that we've announced previously,"" she added. ""Some of the restructuring projects take time to execute, so we'll continue to reduce headcount as we go forward.""
GE said it had the ability to repatriate approximately $10 billion of non-U.S. cash without incremental federal income tax because of recent U.S. tax law changes.
Last month, GE posted nearly a $10 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2017.

Analysts said on Friday that they had expected GE's headcount to fall as the company cuts costs, and were looking for updates to the WMC investigation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) U.S. unit on Friday resolved a lawsuit brought by a North Carolina man whose diesel emissions case was set to be the first go to trial on Monday.
The settlement comes days after Virginia state court Judge Bruce White rejected a request by the German automaker to delay the trial over excess emissions because of what it called ""inflammatory"" comments made by a lawyer representing car owners that it feared would prejudice a jury.
White approved the case's dismissal on Friday. Virginia Lawyer Mike Melkersen, who represents David Doar, the North Carolina man along with more than 300 other U.S. VW diesel owners, said the case had been dismissed by agreement but he declined to disclose the terms. A Volkswagen spokeswoman declined to comment.
The first U.S. trial could have resulted in testimony by current and former VW executives and additional negative publicity stemming from the emissions scandal. Doar had sued VW over fraud and unfair trade practice claims and sought punitive damages as well as compensation for the vehicle.
Doar bought a 2014 diesel Jetta for $23,700 and had rejected a settlement offer from a 2016 class-action agreement that would have reimbursed him for the value of the vehicle. He had sought $725,000 plus attorneys fees in legal filings. The next trial is set for June 4 involving another diesel owner.
Volkswagen said in early February publicity from a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) documentary that disclosed the company had jointly sponsored tests exposing monkeys in 2014 to toxic diesel fumes could prejudice its chances of receiving a fair trial.
The German carmaker is being sued by some consumers after it admitted in September 2015 to cheating on diesel emissions tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history.
Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States that addressed claims from them, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers and included buyback offers and additional compensation for about 500,000 owners.
About 2,000 owners, however, opted out and most are pursuing court claims seeking additional compensation.
Volkswagen of America had sought a six-month delay after Melkersen was interviewed in the Netlfix documentary about the company testing diesel fumes on monkeys.
Volkswagen lawyers said in legal papers that ""pretrial publicity has connected (the company) directly with Hitler and the Holocaust,"" which they said was not relevant to a trial about claims of consumer fraud.

Judge Bruce White had ruled that a fair jury could be seated. ""The jurors don't know much about these cases,"" White said Tuesday of high-profile cases.

1359,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 04:38PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com – Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week.
1. US Equity Markets on Path to Test ‘Powell Put’ 
A few turns higher in volatility as measured by the so-called fear index VIX triggered short-lived panic selling but similar to last week traders were prepared to buy the dips.
That helped the benchmark US equity markets score a second weekly win – the first time since Jan. 26 – suggesting that the recent selloff was a correction and not the start of a prolonged bear market as some had initially feared.
Falling bond yields were also said to have supported sentiment on equities this week as 10-year yields eased from a four-year highs. But others, warned, however, that with bond yields within touching distance of 3% equities could be set for a tough slog higher.
CNBC reported, citing a note from Thomas Lee, founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, that 10-year yields at 3% “intersects a trendline that has led to crashes or bear markets since 1980.” The key difference now, however, was that interest rates are coming off record lows and “like 1950s to 1960s, this period saw higher rates [and] higher equity prices.""
The Dow Jones bagged 347 points on Friday en route to a two-week winning streak.
2. WTI Crude Added To Last Week’s Gains
Crude oil prices settled higher this week after US crude supplies unexpectedly fell for the first time in four weeks while Libyan oil production also lifted sentiment.
The fall in crude supplies was made all the more surprising as traders were expecting weaker refinery activity – which usually lowers demand for crude – would add to supplies. Some said, however, that the draw in crude supplies came amid added incentive to sell rather than store crude as current prices traded at a premium to forward prices – a market structure known as backwardation.
Rising US output, meanwhile, showed little sign of abating as Baker Hughes reported Friday the number of US oil rigs rose for the fifth-straight week. The rise in oil rigs came a few days after the EIA reported crude production remained close to record levels at 10.27 million barrels a day.
On Friday U.S. crude futures rose 78 cents to settle at $63.55 a barrel.
3. Political Uncertainty Left Euro Nursing Weekly Loss
EUR/USD ended the week nursing losses amid political uncertainty in the Eurozone as traders fretted the outcome of the upcoming Italian election less than two weeks.
Mizuho bank said safe haven demand grew Thursday, leading to an uptick in Treasuries and Bunds, as Italian election polls indicated the Five Star Movement is in the lead and a hung parliament potentially looms.
GBP/USD also suffered a weekly loss after Q4 UK GDP was revised lower, reflecting a sluggish economy at a time when Brexit related uncertainty is muddying consumer and business confidence.
4. Gold Prices Struggled Amid Dollar Delight
A rising dollar pressured gold prices to a weekly loss as the Fed’s minutes and monetary policy report released this week did little to jeopardize investor expectations of a March rate hike.
The Fed’s monetary policy report suggested the central bank – under the new leadership of Jerome Powell – remained content with its gradual approach to rate hikes. Fed chair Jerome Powell is expected to testify before Congress next week Feb. 27.
Bank of Montreal (BMO) said it doesn’t expect any material change in the official tone from the Federal Reserve as the best near-term outcome for Powell is policy continuity until there is “clear evidence” that inflation is overheating or the real economy is stumbling.
5. Bitcoin: Where Art Thou, Hodlers?
Bitcoin came under pressure as the latest wave of selling saw traders ditch the “hodl” – the stock market equivalent term of ‘buy and hold.’
This week saw the return of central bankers jawboning on the need to curb bitcoin activity with Bank of England governor Mark Carney telling Reuters that bitcoin has “pretty much failed” as a currency. He further added that it was not a store of value because it is “all over the map.”
While there wasn’t a clear reason for the latest selloff in the land of cryptos, some said bitcoin’s rise close to $12,000 was met with technical resistance – trading levels that trigger selling.
Whether bitcoin’s latest plunge was on regulatory fears or technical resistance doesn’t really matter as traders responded in the same way: slashing their bullish bets on crypto. This was evident by the steep fund outflows close to levels last seen at the depths of the previous ‘bloodbath,’ when bitcoin fell to $6,000.
The total cryptocurrency market cap fell to about $446 billion, at the time of writing, down 13% from this week’s high of roughly $510 billion.
Bitcoin’s total losses over the last seven days was roughly 1% on the bitfinex exchange."
1360,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nordstrom family group finalizing take-private offer - sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Harry Brumpton
(Reuters) - Nordstrom Inc's (N:JWN) founding family group is finalizing plans to submit an offer to take the U.S. department store operator private, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Nordstrom is about to receive the offer as it prepares to report fourth-quarter earnings on March 1 and update investors on its financial performance during the key holiday season. Nordstrom’s stock has risen close to 30 percent since Thanksgiving, on investors expectations of solid profits.
The group met with investment banks last week and is hoping to submit an offer as early as next month once the banks get approval from their credit committees to provide the financing, the sources said. Details of the offer could not be learned.
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Nordstrom declined to comment. A representative for the Nordstrom family also declined to comment.
Nordstrom shares rose 7 percent on the news to $53.74 on Friday, giving the company a market capitalization of close to $9 billion.
The Nordstrom family group, which has partnered with buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners LP, had suspended its attempt to take the company private in October because of difficulties in arranging debt financing for its bid ahead of the key holiday shopping season.
Investment banks at the time balked at providing the debt financing required for the bid of between $7 billion and $8 billion on terms that the family group wanted, sources said at the time.
Nordstrom announced in June that the family group, which owns 31.2 percent of the storied retailer, was considering taking the company private. Sources said at the time the family believed it could better manage the company's operational restructuring and transition to e-commerce away from the public markets.
Nordstrom has formed a special committee of its board of directors to consider any offer received from the family group.
Nordstrom said last month that comparable sales rose 1.2 percent in the nine weeks ended Dec. 30 compared with the same period last year, helped by growth at its off-price discount chain Nordstrom Rack and online businesses. The department store chain slightly raised its full-year earnings forecast at the time to $2.90- $2.95 per share from $2.85-$2.95 per share.

Nordstrom's rival Hudson's Bay Co (TO:HBC), owner of the Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor retail chains, also explored going private last year, though these considerations did not progress.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Dropbox files for IPO of up to $500 million,"By Salvador Rodriguez and Laharee Chatterjee
(Reuters) - Data-sharing business Dropbox Inc on Friday filed for an initial public offering of up to $500 million with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The San Francisco-based company, which started as a free service to share and store photos, music and other large files, competes with much larger technology firms such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) as well as cloud-storage rival Box Inc (N:BOX).
It plans to have its common stock listed on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ""DBX."" In its regulatory filing, Dropbox reported 2017 revenue of $1.11 billion, up 31 percent from $844.8 million a year earlier. The company's net loss narrowed to $111.7 million in 2017 from $210.2 million in 2016. ""With over a $1 billion in revenues it speaks to Dropbox’s success over the past few years and is an impressive number in a fertile space,"" said Daniel Ives at research firm GBH Insights. ""Dropbox’s business model has scaled successfully."" The company's biggest challenge is explaining to Wall Street what differentiates Dropbox from its many competitors, Box Chief Executive Aaron Levie told Reuters on Friday.  “If Dropbox continues to focus on their user experience, they'll be able to compete successfully for consumers and professionals,” Levie said. Dropbox, which has 11 million paying users across 180 countries, said that about half of its 2017 revenue came from customers outside the United States. Goldman Sachs & Co (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Securities are some of the leading underwriters for the IPO. 
The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filing is usually a temporary placeholder.

Companies signed up for $6.9 billion in new loans, leases and lines of credit last month, up from $6.2 billion a year earlier. However, borrowing nearly halved from $12.8 billion in December.
""Despite a spike in delinquencies, which bears a watchful eye for signs of deterioration in credit markets in the coming months, the new year gets off to a strong start for the equipment finance industry,"" ELFA Chief Executive Ralph Petta said in a statement.
""Business owners continue to expand their operations and acquire productive assets, even as interest rates edge up ever so slightly and the Fed is poised to cool an overheated economy,"" Petta said, referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve.
Washington-based ELFA, a trade association that reports economic activity for the $1 trillion equipment finance sector, said credit approvals totaled 76.9 percent in January, down from 77.6 percent in December.
ELFA's leasing and finance index measures the volume of commercial equipment financed in the United States. It is designed to complement the U.S. Commerce Department's durable goods orders report, which it typically precedes by a few days.
ELFA's index is based on a survey of 25 members that include Bank of America Corp (N:BAC), BB&T Corp (N:BBT), CIT Group Inc (N:CIT) and the financing affiliates or units of  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE),  Verizon Communications  Inc (N:VZ),  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), Canon Inc (T:7751) and Volvo AB (ST:VOLVb).
The Equipment Leasing & Finance Foundation, ELFA's non-profit affiliate, said its confidence index for February was 73.2, down from its all-time high of 75.3 in January.
A reading of above 50 indicates a positive outlook.

1381,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 24, 2018 02:48PM ET</span>",China's Geely makes $9 billion Daimler bet against tech 'invaders',"By Norihiko Shirouzu and Edward Taylor
BEIJING/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Chinese carmaker Geely [GEELY.UL] has built up an almost 10 percent stake in  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) in a $9 billion bet by its chairman that he can access the Mercedes-Benz owner's technology in the growing battle for the future of automotives.
The purchase by Li Shufu, Geely's founder and main owner, means China's largest privately-owned automaker is now the biggest shareholder in Germany's Daimler.
Geely said on Saturday there were no plans ""for the time being"" to raise the stake further. Instead, it will seek to forge an alliance with Daimler, which is developing electric and self-driving vehicles, to respond to the challenge from new competitors such as Tesla (O:TSLA), Google (O:GOOGL) and Uber.
""No current car industry player is likely to win this battle against the invaders from outside without friends. To achieve and assert technological leadership, one has to adapt a new way of thinking in terms of sharing and combining strength. My investment in Daimler reflects this vision,"" Li said.
""Daimler is pleased to announce that with Li Shufu it could win another long-term orientated shareholder, which is convinced by Daimler’s innovation strength, strategy and future potential,"" the German company said in a statement. 
Geely officials plan to travel to Stuttgart to meet Daimler executives early next week and also hope to meet top German government officials in Berlin, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Chinese firm plans to use the meetings to underline that it intends to be a supportive long-term investor, they said.
Daimler had no immediate comment on any meetings. Geely and the German economy ministry declined to comment.
Chinese investors in German technology companies have tended to take a consensual approach, buying incremental stakes in companies such as robotics firms Kuka and Kion, typically after long consultation with management and other stakeholders.
In November, Geely asked Daimler to issue new shares so it could buy a stake, as a way to access Mercedes-Benz technology for electric cars and trucks, including battery technology, to help Geely comply with a Chinese crackdown on pollution. 
But the German company turned down the offer saying it did not want to dilute existing shareholders, sources at the time told Reuters.
Li changed tactics, and quietly amassed a stake of 9.69 percent worth $9 billion at Daimler's current share price.
The sources said former  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) Germany CEO Dirk Notheis was the architect of amassing the Daimler stake, working with former Morgan Stanley China executive Yi Bao.
Notheis declined to comment, while Bao was not reachable. 
German state secretary at the economy ministry, Matthias Machnig, said separately that EU trade ministers meeting next week in Sofia would discuss how better to protect strategically important European companies from unwanted investors.
""It is important that Europe keeps a close eye on which key European technologies foreign strategic investors are setting their sights on,"" he said.
Machnig did not comment specifically on Daimler.
EXPANSION DRIVE
Only two or three auto manufacturers will likely survive, a source familiar with Li's thinking told Reuters, prompting Geely to seek access to carmakers with a technological edge.
Daimler is also the only one of Germany's three carmakers not to be controlled by a family. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is majority-owned by the Porsche-Piech clan, while BMW (DE:BMWG) is 47 percent owned by Susanne Klatten, Germany's richest woman, and her brother Stefan Quandt. 
Geely's move poses a challenge to the German carmaker, since Mercedes-Benz already has an industrial alliance to develop cars and trucks with Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA), which owns a 3.1 percent stake in Daimler, and has announced plans to build electric cars with existing Chinese joint-venture partner BAIC Motor Corporation (HK:1958).
Bernstein Research analyst Max Warburton said: ""It's not clear what Geely wants and how it's going to work, but we view this move as part of a broader Chinese move to gain involvement in the European automotive industry.""
""China wants a payback after spending a decade gifting the European auto industry super-normal growth and profits. Now it wants more direct access to technology, brands and profits,"" he wrote in a note shortly after the stake was disclosed.
Zhejiang Geely Holding owns Volvo Cars, LEVC, the maker of London's black cabs, and last year took a majority stake in sports car maker Lotus, a 49.9 percent stake in Malaysian automaker Proton, a $3.3 billion stake in Volvo Trucks and control of flying car start-up Terrafugia. 
""NOT SEEKING CONTROL""
Geely sees potential in Daimler because it is developing high-speed connectivity for autonomous cars at a time when Li believes satellite-based internet connections could become more important, the source familiar with his thinking said. 
The source said Daimler and Geely had not held concrete talks about how to structure a potential joint venture, adding: ""You know we have to become a stakeholder in order to engage.""
Swedish truck maker AB Volvo, one of Geely's other investments, has objected to the Chinese firm's stake-building in Daimler, citing anti-trust concerns, the source added. 

""We will protect interests of both companies by abiding laws in the country and the company's governance structure. We are not seeking to have a controlling power in Daimler,"" the source added.

1387,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 12:31PM ET</span>",U.S. M&A lending hits early year high with jumbo loans,"By Lynn Adler
NEW YORK (LPC) - A flurry of huge US acquisitions is pushing high-grade M&A lending to early year highs as blue-chip firms take advantage of US tax reform and try to fight off the threat of online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Looser US tax rules could produce a record year for M&A deals. About US$120bn of M&A loans have been completed or are in process so far this year, including a record US$100bn loan backing Broadcom’s hostile bid for rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).
This compares with US$203bn of loans completed in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.
In a bid to fight off Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Qualcomm increased its own bid to buy NXP Semiconductors to US$44bn and said that it intended to fund the additional consideration with cash and new debt.
In an eventful week, Broadcom also reduced its bid for Qualcomm to US$117bn from US$121bn, after objecting to Qualcomm’s NXP bid.
Broadcom’s record loan, which has required the biggest-ever bank commitments of more than US$10bn each from some lenders, has been receiving a positive response from lenders undaunted by its size.
“The Broadcom/Qualcomm deal shows that you can raise US$100bn pretty easily, and banks are clamoring to get in,” a senior banker said.
Another jumbo multibillion dollar loan is looming for drugstore operator Walgreens to back its potential purchase of drug distributor AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) to boost its 26% stake. General Mills’ US$8bn acquisition of Blue Buffalo Pet Products is also backed by a bridge loan provided by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
“Deals beget deals,” the senior banker said. “To me, the single biggest change is that you’ve got clarity on tax and regulatory rules.”
M&A deals backing Wyndham Worldwide (NYSE:WYN) Corp’s purchase of La Quinta Holdings’ hotel operations and Hubbell’s acquisition of Aclara Technologies have already been completed this year.
The swelling pipeline also includes large financings backing the merger of beverage companies  Dr Pepper Snapple  Group (NYSE:DPS) and Keurig Green Mountain as well as Energizer Holdings’ buy of Spectrum Brands’ battery and portable lighting business.
SLOW GOING
M&A activity was muted in 2017 due to uncertainty about whether the Trump administration could push through the biggest overhaul of the US tax system in more than 30 years, but the bill was signed in late December.
The US corporate tax rate was cut to 21% from 35%, which helps to boost profits and better position some companies to pull the trigger on takeovers.
“There was uncertainty around tax at the end of the year, which made it hard to do a large deal, but now that there’s clarity, some of that pent up demand for assets is going to come out,” said another senior banker. “It’s pretty broad-based: healthcare, pharma, tech, industrials.”
Fear of online retailer Amazon is also driving consolidation that is reshaping entire sectors, spurred by the giant retailer’s acquisition of upscale grocer Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) last year.
“Amazon comes in and buys Whole Foods, and suddenly all hell breaks loose in grocery retail and everyone has to respond,” the first senior banker said. “There’s now Walgreens with AmerisourceBergen, seeking scale to compete with Amazon, which wants to get into the drug delivery chain. There are ripple effects everywhere.”
CREDIT ‘IN SPADES’
February’s stock market volatility appears to have subsided enough to keep the deal machine active as borrowing costs remain low and the economy gathers pace. Credit is plentiful and liquid banks are eager to lend and rack up related fees.
“The market is there in spades in terms of financing, and banks are beating each other up to participate in these financings,” the first senior banker said.
While some companies are accelerating growth by making acquisitions, others, including  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and Honeywell International (NYSE:HON), will be shedding businesses to streamline and enhance profits.
Those spinoffs will also create demand for loans to support the new entities, helping to boost income earned from arranging the funding.
Lenders of the US$100bn in loans for Broadcom’s proposed purchase of Qualcomm stand to pull in as much as US$300m to US$400m from upfront arrangement fees, according to Freeman Consulting Services.
If the US$31bn bridge-to-bond portion is replaced by bonds, there could be an added US$150m to US$200m earned on underwriting.

If the deal materializes, these tallies alone will surpass fee income of just under US$300m earned by banks on all US investment-grade syndicated lending in last year’s first quarter, Freeman's data show.

""In the course of internal tests, the BMW Group has discovered that a correctly developed software update was mistakenly assigned to certain unsuitable model-versions,"" the company said in a statement. 
""The BMW Group informed the relevant authorities immediately.""
BMW issued the statement after a report in news weekly Der Spiegel suggested it had installed software that manipulated emissions of harmful gases such as nitrogen oxide, something its management has always denied.
Competitor Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) reached a multi-billion-dollar U.S. settlement after admitting installing so-called ""defeat devices"" on its diesel models designed to game emissions tests.
VW has been roiled by the ""Dieselgate"" emissions scandal, which has forced it to set aside 25.8 billion euros ($31.7 billion) to cover fines and related costs, of which it has paid out nearly 20 billion euros.
BMW said the models affected were 5- and 7-Series cars made between 2012 and 2017 containing high-performance diesel engines and three turbo chargers.

BMW did not say where the cars were but said it would cooperate with the relevant authorities on further steps.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>",Century Aluminum CEO: will recall workers if Trump imposes tariffs,"By David Lawder
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The main U.S. producer of high-purity aluminum used in military aircraft is poised to begin restarting idled production lines at its smelter in eastern Kentucky and recall some 350 workers if President Donald Trump imposes aluminum import curbs.
 Century Aluminum Co  (O:CENX) Chief Executive Michael Bless told Reuters on Thursday that the Commerce Department recommendations for aluminum tariffs or quotas would allow U.S. primary aluminum producers to restore all of ""what's left"" of their idled capacity to production.
Century could probably bring its Hawesville, Kentucky smelter back to full output of around 265,000 to 270,000 tons annually by early 2019, Bless said. The company has shut down three-fifths of Hawesville's production machinery in response to a flood of imports in recent years from China, the Middle East and Russia. 
""If we had an order here from the president in the near term and the remedy was consistent with what’s being proposed, we could and we would begin to bring on that capacity at Hawesville. Our board has already decided that,"" Bless said.
The Commerce Department last week revealed its import restriction options for Trump, including a 7.7 percent global aluminum tariff on all products from all countries. It was announced with recommendations for steep tariffs on steel.
Alternatively, the agency proposed a country-specific tariff of 23.6 percent on all products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam, with imports from other countries capped at their 2017 levels. 
A third option would be an import quota for all countries based on 87 percent of their 2017 aluminum exports to the United States.
Bless said Chicago-based Century would support any one of these options, or another remedy that would accomplish Commerce's stated goal of restoring the industry to 80 percent capacity usage.
""We think they got it absolutely right in terms of the harm done to the U.S. primary industry and the emerging harm being done to the downstream industry,"" he said, adding that the curbs were needed to make it ""uneconomic"" for China and other countries with too much capacity or little domestic demand to export their products to the United States.
U.S. aluminum and steel users have voiced opposition to the tariffs, arguing that they will increase costs and could compromise the industry's competitiveness.
However, Bless said that he saw little evidence of final product prices being adjusted to reflect the 50 percent drop in aluminum prices in 2014 and 2015.
He argued that even if a 7.7 percent tariff were fully ""translated"" or passed on, pushing up the aluminum content in a final product by a similar amount, it would only add $35 to the cost of an average U.S.-built passenger car using 450 pounds of aluminum. The price of a six-pack of beer would increase by 1.5 cents, he said.
Even if that happened, he said that may be an acceptable ""price we're willing to pay to ensure security of supply"".
Century also on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter net profit of $35.8 million, bringing its full-year 2017 profit to $48.6 million after a $252.4 million loss in 2016.
But Defense Secretary James Mattis has said in a memo to the Commerce Department that he would prefer a delay in aluminum tariffs should Trump proceed with tariffs to aid the steel industry. 
Bless added that without a remedy to restrict imports, it would be difficult for the company to continue to operate its plants at 40 percent to 50 percent of capacity. It has already been deferring maintenance and it would be a difficult decision to reinvest without more certainty. 
""We’ve been skimping by with these plants and that’s catching up with us,"" he added.

1408,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","Legal hurdles, not Amazon, key concern for U.S. dental supply firms","By Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) -  Henry Schein  Inc (O:HSIC) and Patterson Cos Inc (O:PDCO) have bigger things to worry about than Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) potentially disrupting the niche dental-equipment market they dominate in the United States.
Their stocks, as well as those of other U.S. drug and medical equipment suppliers, have taken a beating in the past year as speculation over Amazon expanding its considerable reach gained momentum.
But investors and analysts told Reuters that the larger overhang on the two dental suppliers, and privately held Benco Dental Supply, is a recent complaint filed against them by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
The complaint alleges that the three companies broke antitrust law by conspiring to refuse discounts to dentists. The administrative trial is scheduled to begin on Oct. 16.
The trial could last years, and even a quick settlement could force the companies to ramp up discounts to customers and in turn pressure their margins, investors and analysts said.
""I think for now I would avoid investing in that particular industry, and kind of keep a careful watch,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, which owns shares in Henry Schein and Patterson.
All three companies have issued public statement denying the FTC's allegations. Patterson declined to comment further.
Henry Schein, in a letter it sent customers on Thursday, said the FTC was ""essentially asking us to stop doing something that we believe we never did in the first place.""
A spokeswoman for Benco Dental said the company expected ""to fully resolve this issue in a way that clarifies the integrity of our people and processes."" SETTLEMENT LIKELY Henry Schein shares have lost nearly a fourth of their value, while Patterson's stock is down 30 percent since May, roughly when speculation of Amazon's entry into their market started. After Henry Schein reported quarterly results on Tuesday, several analysts cut their price targets on its stock, mainly due to the risks associated with the FTC complaint. ""While the FTC allegation is for injunctive relief and seeks no monetary damages or fines, there is no clear timeline to a resolution of the matter,"" Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said in a research note. He lowered his rating on Henry Schein to ""in-line"" from ""outperform"" and said he expected gains in the company's stock to remain muted until further clarity on the complaint, possibly in late 2018 or early 2019. The companies are likely to settle, legal experts said. In a similar complaint in 2015, a small Meridian, Idaho-based provider of drug-and-alcohol testing services settled with the FTC months after the regulator filed a complaint alleging the company was colluding with a rival to keep prices high. Antitrust lawyers, however, said the FTC's complaint against the dental suppliers was more serious than usual and did not rely on just circumstantial evidence. ""It appears the FTC has evidence of an explicit agreement between at least two of these so-called competitors and that is a stronger case than what you often typically see,"" said Nicholas Gravante, an antitrust lawyer at Boies Schiller Flexner. Gravante is not involved with the complaint. Still, Wall Street analysts mostly remain bullish about these companies' businesses, even with the looming threat of Amazon, which they said could take a while to play out. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that the ecommerce giant was looking to expand its business-to-business marketplace that already sells professional medical products and hospital consumables such as gloves. Analysts said the dental companies were shielded by their long-standing relationships with dentists, while their narrow-margin business model may make it tough for Amazon to undercut them. ""I think Amazon is certainly a threat, certainly a negative, but not to the extent to which stocks like Henry Schein sold off,"" said Kevin Kedra, an analyst at Gabelli & Co. 
Gabelli owns less than 1 percent of Henry Schein shares and about 2 percent of Patterson.

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 11:30AM ET</span>",Dockless bike share pioneer Gobee quits Paris,"By Geert De Clercq
PARIS (Reuters) - Hong Kong startup Gobee.bike, the first of a wave of Asian dockless bike share operators that launched in Paris last year, has halted operations in the French capital, industry sources said on Friday. 
Gobee's green bikes have virtually disappeared from the streets in the past few days and its mobile phone app was inactive in the past few days. 
Gobee did not respond to requests for comment, but two industry sources said it had ceased operations. Some customers had been able to recoup their deposits, but on Friday the app's account balance service was unavailable.
Last month, Gobee had pulled out of the Belgian capital Brussels and the French cities of Lille and Reims because of vandalism. Then, last week, it announced its withdrawal from Italy, saying 60 percent of its European fleet had been damaged or stolen.
Gobee's exit leaves Paris with three remaining Asian-owned operators, Singapore's oBike, with about 1,800 grey-orange bikes, and two major Chinese firms: Ofo, with about 1,000 yellow bikes, and Mobike, with several thousand red bikes.
The Asian operators, whose bikes can be parked anywhere after use, have jumped into the market while Paris switches operators for its pioneering Velib scheme.
However, in China at least, the business model for bike sharing appears to be in some trouble, as large numbers of firms go under, leaving mountains of misshapen bikes piling up on streets. 
In France, the quality of the bikes appears to be an issue.
Charles Maguin, head of the cycling group Paris en Selle (Paris in the Saddle), said Gobee's bikes had been too fragile.
User groups say the Mobikes, with their solid tyres, a driveshaft rather than a chain, and solid wheel struts instead of wire spokes, appear more resilient against vandalism and heavy use.
To prevent vandalism and theft, oBike last week made a deal with three municipalities east of Paris. In return for half the revenue, cycling associations distribute and maintain the bicycles, which have to stay within the limits of the three municipalities.
Meanwhile, Paris's Velib switchover is not going smoothly.

Early this month, only some 200 of about 1,400 planned docking stations were in operation. The new operator, Smovengo, wants to get 20,000 Velibs on the road by the end of next month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic commissioner at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday questioned the growing use of complex financial products by retail investors such as derivatives based on stock market volatility indicators that were linked to recent weeks of market turmoil.
Commissioner Kara Stein questioned whether retail investors are taking risks with complicated financial products that they cannot even appreciate. In remarks prepared for the ""SEC Speaks"" conference in Washington, she cited the wild price swings in recent weeks of the VIX and products that attempt to track that gauge of future stock market volatility.
""The question should be...not can we create complex and esoteric products, but should we?"" she said.
Dramatic swings in the stock market in recent weeks saw some volatility products derived from VIX drastically lose their value, driving firms to cancel some of those products or restrict investor access.
Stein warned that it is easier than ever for average investors to gain access to incredibly complicated products, and even heightened disclosure does not guaranteed investors appreciate those risks.
""What concerns me is the disconnect between what investors actually understand and what they really need to understand in order to have a fighting chance at using these products the way they are designed to be used,"" she said.

Stein said the SEC has seen ""abuses relating to the purchase and sale of complex products,"" and is bringing enforcement actions along those lines. But she called on private parties, including exchanges and industry professionals, to do more to ensure the average investor is not investing in financial products they do not understand.

1413,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>","Google raises price of YouTube TV, adds sports, Turner","By Jessica Toonkel
(Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google is raising the price of its YouTube TV online service for new customers as it adds channels from Time Warner Inc's Turner, National Basketball League and Major League Baseball, the company said Wednesday. 
Less than one year after launching YouTube TV, the company is increasing its pricing to $40 per month from $35 per month as it adds Turner's channels, which include TNT, CNN and TBS, and soon will be adding MLB Network and NBA TV, the company said.
Google is expanding its offering at a time when a growing number of competing services, such as Dish Network Corp's Sling TV, AT&T's DirecTV Now and Hulu, are vying to win over the growing number of viewers who are cancelling their cable subscriptions to watch their favorite shows online. 
The four largest cable and satellite companies lost 1.5 million pay TV customers in 2017.
DirectTV Now has over 2 million subscribers, according to AT&T (NYSE:T). Sling TV, Hulu and YouTube TV do not disclose how many users they have, but research firm BTIG estimates they respectively had 2.1 million, 500,000 and 350,000 as of the end of 2017.
The costs for these competing offerings range from $20 for Sling TV's most basic offering of 30 channels to $39.99 for Hulu's one with more than 50 channels and its library of shows and movies, which costs $7.99 separately. 
Google is betting that its strong sports offering will help win over more subscribers, said Heather Moosnick, director of content partnerships, YouTube TV. 
""Sports is really one of the key offerings that a millennial would be willing to pay for a live TV service,"" she said. 
To that end, Google has targeted sports fans with its TV ads this year. Ninety-six percent of YouTube TV's ads on television so far this year have appeared during sports programming, including the Super Bowl, according to iSpot.tv, which tracks TV ads.
When Google launched YouTube TV last April it was cautious with how much content it was offering so that it could keep the price low enough to entice cord cutters or people considering cutting the cord, Moosnick said. 
At launch YouTube TV offered almost 50 channels in five markets. With these additions, YouTube TV will have almost 60 channels, and be in 100 markets, Moosnick said.

PARIS (Reuters) - French banks have raised customer charges at a slower pace this year as new low-cost online lenders and rules led some to predict a price war which would weigh on margins.
Data from state statistics institute INSEE released this week showed growth in charges slowed in January when lenders usually set their rates for the year, after they raised fees in 2017 at the highest pace in nearly 20 years.
The INSEE data showed that consumer price index of banking charges rose by 1.05 percent over one year in January, down from 2.49 percent in January of last year.
""Banking services will not be free. The security of a deposit is by essence costly,"" Frederic Oudea, chief executive of  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) said earlier this year.
Established banks, such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP), Societe Generale and  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) are facing increased competition from the likes of new online low-cost banks such as N26 or Orange bank.
Consultancy firm EY estimated that the new low-cost online banks now have a five percent share of the French market which totals 120 million accounts.
Analysts had predicted that this could spark a price war as happened in France's telecoms sector, while the established banks have invested a lot to retain clients with their own low-cost offers, such as BNP Paribas' Hello Bank!, Boursorama for SocGen or EKO for cooperative group Credit Agricole.
""We are very far from the situation which was observed in the French telecom industry in 2012 when telecom operators had to face a period of several months of declines in average revenue per user,"" said Axel Duplan, a senior manager at EY. 
That is partly because French retail banking clients have so far tended not to leave their established lender, instead open new accounts at lower cost online banks for daily use.
""Customers don't yet change banks frequently, not seeing them as easily replaceable as digital providers, but we believe this shift could occur in the medium term as the new legal framework eases banking mobility,"" analysts at ratings agency S&P said in a note.
French bank clients like not only having an account but also savings products, life, auto, property, and health insurance that online banks are so far not able to provide, S&P said.
BNP Paribas' chief financial officer Lars Machenil said in February it was yet to see the impact of the arrival of Orange bank and a step-up in competition.

1416,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 12:04PM ET</span>",U.S. senators press Justice Department on Daimler emissions probe: letter,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two Democratic U.S. senators on Friday urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to thoroughly investigate  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) after a media report alleged the automaker used potentially illegal software to pass diesel emissions tests, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
German newspaper Bild am Sonntag had reported on Sunday that U.S. investigators probing the Mercedes-Benz parent found that its cars were equipped with software which may have helped them to pass diesel emissions tests, citing confidential documents. 
The report cited emails from Daimler engineers questioning whether these software functions were legal. 
Senators Edward Markey and Richard Blumenthal said recent reports ""raise serious questions as to whether Daimler AG deceived federal regulators and U.S. consumers and endangered public health."" 
They added prosecutors should take ""appropriate action against the company, including criminal charges against company executives if warranted."" 
A Daimler spokesman said Friday the German automaker has ""been fully cooperating with the U.S. authorities for more than two years and provided comprehensive transparency.""
Diesel vehicles have been under heightened scrutiny since Daimler rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) was forced to pay billions of dollars in fines after admitting in 2015 to using software to evade exhaust tests by manipulating emissions to disguise excess pollution. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in February 2016 requested information from Mercedes-Benz to explain diesel emissions levels. Daimler said in April 2016 the Justice Department had asked it to investigate its emissions certification process.
A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately comment.
Daimler has said in financial filings it faced ongoing investigations by U.S. and German authorities into excess diesel emissions that could lead to significant penalties and recalls.
Software-based engine management systems are illegal if they are not declared to U.S. regulators and if designed to evade anti-pollution tests.
In Europe, carmakers have legally made use of a ""thermal window,"" a temperature threshold allowing carmakers to throttle back emissions management systems to protect the engine from damage.
The Justice Department sued  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) in May, accusing it of illegally using software that led to excess emissions in 104,000 U.S. diesel vehicles sold since 2014. The government is seeking ""substantial"" civil penalties to settle the lawsuit.
German prosecutors searched Daimler premises in May 2017 as part of an ongoing fraud probe related to false advertising and possible manipulation of exhaust-gas after-treatment in diesel cars.
Stuttgart prosecutors said on Monday two Daimler employees were being investigated as part of the probe.

In May, Daimler said it had dropped plans to seek U.S. approval to sell 2017 Mercedes-Benz U.S. diesel vehicles. The company faces ongoing U.S. lawsuits from investors.

1417,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 05:41PM ET</span>",U.S. banks set for M&A wave as Trump cuts red tape,"By David French and Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An easing of financial rules will soon unleash pent-up mergers and acquisitions among mid-sized U.S. banks, according to deal bankers, analysts and bank executives.
Deal activity in the sector has languished since the 2007-2009 financial crisis thanks to stricter rules on lenders with more than $50 billion in assets and aggressive enforcement of rules barring banks with compliance issues from expanding. 
Lawmakers, spurred on by the leadership of Republican President Donald Trump, are set to raise the threshold for systemically important banks, making lenders that had capped growth to avoid the added compliance and capital costs more inclined to combine.
A bipartisan bill, expected to pass the U.S. Senate in coming weeks, will raise the threshold to $250 billion, the biggest change yet to the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act.
""To the extent that $50 billion gets up to $250 billion, as is being talked about, that will certainly help take a very large impediment out of the way and you'll likely see more M&A activity,"" said Rajinder Singh, chief executive of Miami Lakes-based  BankUnited Inc  (N:BKU), which has $30 billion in assets. 
Regulators are also looking to expedite deal approvals and ease up on compliance issues that can delay transactions. 
The number of U.S. bank deals has fallen in each of the past four years, dropping 23 percent between 2014 and 2017, according to Reuters data. This came at a time when overall M&A activity was rising each year.
Deals will likely emerge among banks with between $20 billion and $200 billion in assets, Singh added. 
BankUnited, with annual asset growth of 10 percent to 15 percent, had been marching toward the $50 billion mark and any acquisition would have the drawback of bringing it there more quickly, said Singh.
""If it goes to $250 [billion], that's the pressure off,"" he said, adding that if BankUnited were to make a purchase, it would likely be small.
BIGGER DEALS
Investment bankers told Reuters they expect deal talks to kick off once the Senate bill passes. 
One, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said a regional bank CEO told him his institution was targeting three or four purchases within five years.
Traditional M&A factors are also positive.
The KBW Bank Index (BKX) has risen around 49 percent since Trump's election, giving sellers comfort they are getting a good price and buyers strong currency to fund stock mergers. A positive U.S. economic outlook also provides a solid backdrop.
""We expect to see more activity in the $20 to $30 billion asset space, and likely some incremental action by larger banks with assets of $100 billion-plus,"" said Gary Howe, head of Lazard's North American Financial Institutions Group.
Banks below the threshold that said in analyst calls last month they saw an opportunity to do deals include First Horizon National Corp (N:FHN), and  Associated Banc-Corp . (N:ASB). 
First Horizon declined to comment. Associated Banc-Corp did not respond to a request for comment.
PENALTY BOX
Bank regulators are also looking at speeding up the often lengthy and unpredictable process for approving tie-ups. 
The Federal Reserve, the key gatekeeper for banks, is reviewing its M&A application process, officials have said.
""It's important we focus on faster decision-making, greater transparency, and a general streamlining of the application review process. So one of the areas we're trying to address first is the processing of bank M&A deals,"" Adam Cohen, general counsel at the Fed, told a conference last month.
The Fed took 54 days on average to approve a deal in the first half of 2017, and that shot up to 190 days if the deal received adverse public feedback, Fed data showed. 
Delays can stretch into years if a buyer has compliance issues. 
It took M&T Bank (N:MTB) more than three years to complete its 2015 tie-up with Hudson City Bancorp after the Fed found problems with M&T's compliance systems.
Data provided by consultancy Navigant suggests around 370 firms may be in this so-called regulatory penalty box. 
But a softening of enforcement should see fewer banks enter the penalty box in the first place.
Financial regulators have pledged to relax how they assess compliance with fair lending, anti-money laundering and marketing rules that generate the majority of problems.
The Fed is also considering how it can speed up the resolution of these infractions, one person with knowledge of the matter said.
“If there is relief on one or both of the Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering or the Community Reinvestment Act ... that would be helpful for M&A by easing the potential for a long regulatory review process,"" said Michael Reed, partner in the M&A practice at law firm Covington & Burling. 

A spokesman for the Fed declined to comment.

1418,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 01:32PM ET</span>",VW's profitability may take a hit from electric vehicle shift,"By Andreas Cremer
BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said profitability could take a hit this year as the carmaker invests billions of euros in electric vehicles (EVs) and launches a raft of new models.
Europe's largest automotive group, which reported record 2017 earnings on Friday, said it expected a return on sales for 2018 of between 6.5 and 7.5 percent before special items, after reaching 7.4 percent last year. It expects revenue to exceed the 2017 record of 231 billion euros ($284.13 billion) by as much as 5 percent. 
Volkswagen (VW) is investing billions of euros into electric and self-driving cars while still paying out for the ""Dieselgate"" emissions scandal which has cost the company around $30 billion in charges and fines.
The German group set aside another 600 million euros in the fourth quarter in provisions for higher legal risks and vehicle buy-backs related to the emissions scandal, raising 2017 provisions to 3.2 billion euros.
In total, VW has now put aside 25.8 billion euros to cover fines, compensation and vehicle refits, of which nearly 20 billion have so far been paid out.
The Wolfsburg-based carmaker is known for taking a conservative stance when it comes to its outlook for profitability, but analysts were still disappointed.
""There is room for them to go higher,"" said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Juergen Pieper who has a ""buy"" recommendation on VW shares. ""The market probably needs to scale back its expectations a bit.""
VW shares fell after the results and closed 0.8 percent lower at 162.60 euros.
VW had been a laggard on electrification until it admitted in 2015 to cheating on U.S. diesel emissions tests and had to deal with new Chinese quotas for EVs and tightening regulation in Europe. This prompted a strategic shift to zero-emission and self-driving technology, and VW has one of the most ambitious programs in the industry. 
""We must not relax our efforts because huge challenges lie ahead,"" finance chief Frank Witter said. ""Shaping the group's transformation will not only require a great deal of time and energy, it will also be very expensive.""
Group operating profit after special items nearly doubled to a record 13.8 billion euros from 7.1 billion a year ago, VW said, helped by record sales of luxury Audis and Porsches but below the bottom-end forecast of 13.9 billion in a Reuters poll.
VW said earnings were driven by a growing share of sales of higher-margin models such as the redesigned Tiguan SUV and the Arteon fastback and increasing savings from VW's modular platforms.
The carmaker forecast 2018 group sales to exceed moderately last year's record of 10.7 million vehicles. Group sales jumped 10 percent in January with demand up in all major world regions, showing that the emissions scandal has not dented VW's popularity among consumers.
The company faced a new diesel scandal last month when it emerged that VW and other German carmakers had sponsored diesel fume tests involving monkeys and humans.
VW's supervisory board on Friday also discussed steps to prevent such research experiments from happening again, a source at the carmaker said, as it is seeking to become more accountable after ""Dieselgate."" 
Separately, management and the supervisory board on Friday proposed to raise the dividend for 2017 to 3.90 euros per common share and to 3.96 euros per preference share, from 2.00 euros and 2.06 euros respectively for the previous.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday refused to overturn former drug company executive Martin Shkreli's conviction of scheming to manipulate his company's stock price.
U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto said at a court hearing in Brooklyn that there was enough evidence to support a jury's verdict last August that Shkreli tried to prop up the price of shares in Retrophin Inc (O:RTRX) by directing people he knew not to sell them.
Shkreli, who was ordered jailed in September after he put a $5,000 bounty on Hillary Clinton's hair in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, was present at the hearing, sporting a new beard and smiling at times.
Shkreli, 34, became known as ""Pharma Bro"" after raising the price of anti-infection drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015 while he was chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals. The move sparked outrage by patients and U.S. lawmakers.
His criminal convictions are unrelated to Daraprim, stemming instead from securities fraud charges brought in December 2015.
In addition to the stock manipulation charge, Shkreli stands convicted of lying to investors in two hedge funds he controlled, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare.
Matsumoto did not rule on the key issue at Friday's hearing - the amount of financial loss for which Shkreli was responsible, which could play a key role in his March 9 sentencing.
Prosecutors do not dispute that Shkreli's investors eventually came out ahead after Shkreli paid them in shares of Retrophin, which he founded in 2011.
The jury found Shkreli not guilty of a separate charge that he conspired to defraud Retrophin when he used the company to pay back the investors.
Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Shkreli, argued at Friday's hearing that Shkreli should get credit for paying the investors back. Shkreli's lawyers had argued in court filings that Shkreli's conduct had caused no financial loss at all, which could bolster an argument for a light sentence.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith, a prosecutor, said it was Shkreli's intent that mattered.
""He did, in fact, take that money to perpetuate a fraud,"" she said. ""What mattered to him was his reputation as a hedge fund manager.""
Prosecutors have argued for a loss amount of as much as $20 million, which could result in a much harsher sentence under federal guidelines. Though judges must consider the guidelines, they are not mandatory.

Shkreli's lawyers and prosecutors have not yet submitted filings on what the sentence should be.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp and several of its mutual funds persuaded a U.S. appeals court on Friday to revive their lawsuit seeking to hold 17 banks responsible for manipulation of the benchmark Libor interest rate.
In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a lower court judge erred in dismissing Schwab's federal securities law claims over alleged misrepresentations by banks that caused it to buy floating-rate debt tied to Libor.
The judge was ""wrong to assume, at the pleading stage, that Schwab was not harmed by, and may have even benefitted from, Libor manipulation,"" Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote in a 64-page decision.
Lynch said the lower court judge, U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, also concluded incorrectly that she lacked jurisdiction over various Schwab claims under California law, and that Schwab brought some unjust enrichment claims too late.
Schwab sought damages tied to $665 billion of transactions, including more than $40 billion of debt issued by Bank of America,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), HSBC, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Norinchukin [NORB.UL], Rabobank [RABO.UL], Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) and UBS.
It claimed that banks conspired to suppress Libor, causing the San Francisco-based discount brokerage and its bond and money market funds to earn lower returns.
Friday's decision revived claims that Buchwald dismissed in October 2015, in what Lynch called a ""Herculean"" 436-page ruling involving Schwab and other plaintiffs. Buchwald also oversees a variety of other Libor manipulation.
Schwab and its outside lawyer Thomas Goldstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Neal Katyal, who according to court records argued on the banks' behalf, did not immediately respond to similar requests.
Libor, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, is used by banks to set rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of credit card, mortgage, student loan and other transactions, and to determine the cost of borrowing from each other.
Banks have paid roughly $9 billion to settle Libor-rigging probes worldwide. Last July, the head of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority said that regulator will phase out Libor by the end of 2021, citing a lack of data underpinning it.

The case is Charles Schwab Corp et al v Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) et al, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 16-01189.

1424,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 10:02AM ET</span>",Drifting Currency Markets May Be Given Direction by Fed's Powell,"(Bloomberg) -- Major currencies were range bound in the second half of the week as neither the Federal Reserve minutes nor the European Central Bank account of their latest meetings provided markets with much direction. But traders may be about to get a clearer narrative.
The dollar found itself recently amid two opposing forces causing it to whipsaw: in the red corner, verbal intervention by the Trump administration and investor focus on the increase in the U.S. deficit. Opposite stood higher wages, a hawkish Fed and a stock sell-off amid higher yields.
New Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday, moved forward from Feb. 28 due to a scheduling issue, and the Senate Banking Committee on March 1 could see one side of the ring getting the upper hand.
Powell could offer a clear view on his assessment of the economy and explain how comfortable policy makers are with their baseline scenario of three hikes this year, or even signal faster tightening ahead. Traders will pay close attention to any remarks over elevated asset valuations and broader market imbalances.
Should he open the way for faster-than-anticipated hiking, investors could place more focus on higher rates rather than anything else. Given that the greenback and U.S. yields have regained their positive correlation after the stock rout earlier this month, the dollar could extend its rebound.
And it may do so convincingly against the euro. Common currency bulls have yet to meet a fresh catalyst that would support the notion of adding more longs in their portfolios while the next ECB meeting is two weeks away.
On top of that, traders increasingly feel the need to hedge against a euro-negative outcome from the Italian elections due March 4 and Germany’s SPD vote the same day. Risk reversals show demand for euro puts gets stronger as we head into the risk events, which has weighed in the cash market as well.
A word of caution from history though: In the week before the first round of the French elections in April 2017, the euro actually gained as some traders took profits on their shorts and natural hedging demand eased. Signs that political stability in the euro area won’t be challenged and/or ECB officials pointing to a language shift next month could see similar moves in euro-dollar.

Justice officials in Frankfurt said in an emailed statement to Reuters on Friday that they had decided against extradition because of a statute of limitations in prosecuting the case. 
The formal denial of extradition was on Wednesday, the statement said, after a preliminary ruling in November.
British prosecutors had been granted warrants in 2016 for the arrest of four Germans, who they said were part of a conspiracy to defraud in relation to their alleged role in manipulating Euribor, the euro interbank offered rate.
A spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Reuters is not naming the four former Deutsche Bank employees for legal reasons. 
Deutsche Bank,  Barclays  (L:BARC) and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) admitted their involvement in a Euribor cartel in 2013 in a European Commission investigation.
The Commission fined Deutsche and SocGen a total of $1 billion, and two years later U.S. and British authorities fined the German bank another $2.5 billion and its London subsidiary pleaded guilty to rate-rigging. 
Barclays received immunity for revealing the alleged cartel in the Brussels investigation but paid $453 million to U.S. and British authorities to settle rate-rigging allegations in 2012.

The refund, which will average $190 per account, stems from the bank's discovery that it had not used a proper method for reducing interest charges for cardholders who resumed timely payments after having had to pay penalty rates for lapses.
The errors amounted to about 10 percent of the interest reductions cardholders were due, the bank said. It estimated that the other 90 percent of rate savings were properly credited to accounts.
The cost of the reimbursements has already been factored in to Citigroup's 2017 results.
Under a federal law known as the CARD Act, banks have been required since 2011 to cut back on penalty interest rates after cardholders resume timely payments. The bank said it found it erred in how it calculated some of those reductions.
“While we believed our methodology was sound, a periodic internal review identified potential flaws in the methodology used to reevaluate interest rates on some credit card accounts,"" Citigroup spokeswoman Liz Fogarty said in a statement.
""While we have found no evidence of employee misconduct, we should have identified these issues sooner,"" the statement added.
Citigroup disclosed the problem generally in an annual securities filing early in the day and provided more details later.

Citigroup was the third biggest U.S. card lender in 2016, according to the Nilson Report.

LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon's (O:AMZN) assault on the retail industry has brought misery to traditional retailers without a strong web presence.
Less well noticed is the patchwork of European companies that are turning the e-commerce revolution to their advantage, supplying online giants with everything from forklift trucks and storage space to cardboard boxes and automated warehouses. 
Mainly bricks-and-mortar retailers such as  Debenhams  (L:DEB), H&M (ST:HMb) and Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) have faced a torrid few years as stretched consumers increasingly look online for bargains. 
Online retail sales are growing at double-digit percentage rates in every western European country, according to consultancy the Centre for Retail Research. 
In Britain, a fifth of transactions are now conducted online, a five-fold increase over the last decade. 
(GRAPHIC - Online retail continues to grow: http://reut.rs/2EV2LiN) 
The world's dominant online retailer Amazon (O:AMZN), whose shares have soared 73 percent in the last year, is outside the remit of most European investors because it is U.S. listed, so they have had to look for other ways of buying into the trend.
One is investing in companies that have benefited from the rise of e-commerce. 
On Feb. 16, warehouse owner Segro’s (L:SGRO) shares hit a decade-high after it said space-hungry clients, many in online retail and logistics, continued to buy up storage.
“There is a bull market in impatience,” said Gary Paulin, head of global equities at broker  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS). “Consumers want things sooner, faster, now.” 
He advises clients to buy shares in Kion (DE:KGX), a German forklift truck-maker that is automating warehouses for online retailers, speeding up deliveries in the process. 
He also flagged a turnaround at online supermarket Ocado (L:OCDO). The company has long been targeted by short-sellers betting its share price will fall, but recently it has signed tie-ups with food retailers Casino and Sobeys, and its shares have more-than-doubled since November. 
Martin Todd, a fund manager at Hermes Investment Management, owns shares in Kion as well as DS Smith (L:SMDS), a cardboard-box maker which supplies Amazon as well as a number of other online retailers. 
DS Smith is developing technology to custom-make boxes for Amazon that will help reduce large gaps in packages that increase freight costs.
“You might think it is a pretty unsexy business ... (but) it is getting more high tech in what is traditionally a very low tech industry,” Todd said. 
The company recently entered Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 (FTSE) index for the first time. 
Buying some stocks exposed to online retail does not come cheap. Ocado shares are currently trading at more than 800 times forecast earnings, according to Eikon data.
John Bennett, head of European equities at Janus Henderson Investors, said that while traditional retailers were “absolutely dying”, stocks such as Kion were too expensive for him to own. 

“It became a very popular name, and I tend to shy away (from widely-owned companies),” he said. “I am far too curmudgeonly on the multiples you pay.”

The bank said it was the first FTSE 100 company to make a public commitment to have women fill 40 percent of senior roles by 2020. 
""However, we do not want to stop here and recognize that there is still more work to do. We remain committed to our gender target and closing the pay gap,” a spokeswoman for the bank said.
Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) on Friday disclosed a gender pay gap of 37 percent.  Barclays  (L:BARC) this week disclosed a gap in its investment bank of 50 percent, drawing criticism from lawmakers.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Friday, buoyed by gains in technology stocks and a pullback in Treasury yields as the Federal Reserve eased concerns about the path of interest rate hikes this year. 
The central bank, looking past the recent stock market sell-off and inflation concerns, said it expected economic growth to remain steady and saw no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes. 
Investors largely expect the Fed to raise rates three times this year, beginning with its next meeting in March, the first under new Chair Jerome Powell. Traders currently see a 95.5 percent chance of a quarter-point hike next month, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
""The Fed has come out and made an announcement basically reinforcing the idea they are still on track for three rate hikes this year, which had been their forecast before we got some of the increased inflation news over the last month,"" said Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell in New York. 
""It signals to the markets that while there is increased concern about higher rates and inflation, the Fed has really not seen enough to justify getting much more hawkish."" 
Powell's first public outing will be on Tuesday, when he will testify separately before the House and Senate committees.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 229.23 points, or 0.92 percent, to 25,191.71, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 31.89 points, or 1.18 percent, to 2,735.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 98.50 points, or 1.37 percent, to 7,308.59.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 13/32 in price to yield 2.8714 percent, from 2.917 percent late on Thursday.
The dip in yields helped boost bond proxy sector such as utilities, up 2.20 percent, and real estate <.SPLRCR>, up 1.50 percent.
Tech shares (SPLRCT) climbed 1.69 percent led by gains in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (N:HPE), which rose 10.2 percent and HP Inc (N:HPQ), up 3.2 percent. 
The two companies created from the split of Hewlett Packard Co in 2015, reported strong results and HPE also announced a plan to return $7 billion to shareholders.
Blue Buffalo Pet Products (O:BUFF) jumped 17.23 percent after  General Mills  (N:GIS) said it would buy the natural pet food maker for $8 billion. General Mills was the biggest percentage decline on S&P 500, falling 4.08 percent.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.29-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) said on Friday it would fight on after a Texas appeals court upheld a $351 million award against the Swiss bank over its role in a Las Vegas resort project whose finances collapsed a decade ago.
The Texas Court of Appeals this week upheld the award, which includes damages and interest, in favor of Texas-based Highland Capital Management that in 2007 helped refinance the Lake Las Vegas resort on an artificial Nevada lake.
The decision followed a 2014 Texas jury's conclusion that Credit Suisse had fraudulently enticed investors including Dallas-based Highland to back a $540 million loan, only to have the Lake Las Vegas project quickly seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy. [http://reut.rs/2EOy1wk]
On Friday, Credit Suisse said it would continue its appeals, a process it expects to take up to 12 months. 
""Credit Suisse ... does not believe the decision is supported by applicable law,"" the bank said in a statement.
""This is a legacy matter dating back to 2007. Given the number of favorable verdicts in Credit Suisse vs Highland Capital cases to date, we look forward to the outcome of the appeal process.""
The case can now go to the Texas Supreme Court.
Credit Suisse said it would not have to pay anything until the matter was finally resolved, though Highland said the judgment would accrue at an annual interest rate of 9 percent. 
""Today's ruling is a major milestone in our efforts to recover damages for our investors,"" said James Dondero, president of Highland Capital Management.
""We are pleased the appellate court recognized the harm caused to our investors by Credit Suisse's fraud and breaches of contract.""
Lake Las Vegas was among ill-fated real estate projects that included Tamarack Resort in Idaho, Montana's Yellowstone Club and resorts in Florida, North Carolina and the Bahamas in which Credit Suisse arranged some $3 billion in syndicated loans to fund their development.
When resorts' finances collapsed around 2007, some investors alleged Credit Suisse and others committed fraud by using an unacceptable appraisal method to overvalue the properties. [http://reut.rs/2HERscZ]
A separate lawsuit in U.S. District Court Idaho alleging a predatory ""loan-to-own"" scheme by Credit Suisse was dismissed in 2016, the Swiss bank said in its 2016 annual report, though plaintiffs are appealing. 
Meanwhile, there have also been lawsuits in New York state court pitting Highland against Credit Suisse, some of which have been settled.

Lake Las Vegas and other resorts were partially completed when their finances collapsed during the 2007-8 financial crisis. Some, including Lake Las Vegas, the Yellowstone Club and Tamarack, have continued in various forms following the entry of new investors.

1464,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 07:16AM ET</span>",Numbers starting to add up for Tesla trucks: DHL executive,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) - The numbers behind Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) long-distance Semi electric trucks are close to making sense for hauliers looking at a shift away from diesel that may save them tens of thousands of dollars a year, according to an executive with DHL.
Jim Monkmeyer, president, Transportation at DHL Supply Chain, was among the first to order the trucks Silicon Valley billionaire Elon Musk's company is expected to begin churning out in 2019.
He says the 10 trucks ordered are a test run and that he is still years away from switching the majority of his fleet of trucks to electric. But he is taking heed of a major shift away from diesel and the money it could save DHL. 
He says he could potentially pay off the difference between the purchase price of a Tesla Semi and a traditional diesel truck in less than two years, thanks to savings on maintenance and fuel.
""We are estimating that we could have pay back within a year-and-a-half based on energy usage as well as lower maintenance cost,"" Monkmeyer told Reuters in an interview from his office in Columbus, Ohio. 
""The maintenance savings can be enormous as well. Just because the engines are much simpler in terms of the number of parts and the complexities of the parts.""
The payback benefit is one of the keys to the success of the new generation of electric trucks and DHL, a unit of Germany's  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn), has a history in the area, having already introduced 5,000 of its own electric ""scooter"" vans for local deliveries.
The two-year timeline also chimes with assurances being given by Daimler AG's van unit to customers interested in its forthcoming electric Sprinter van that the total cost of ownership will be the same as the cost to own and operate a conventional van over a few years.
COMMON THREADS
Monkmeyer says he does not expect to buy just Tesla electric trucks, but the in-depth discussions on price and feasibility that DHL is running on the trucks are in line with several small and large international hauliers who spoke to Reuters. 
A truck runs around 65,000-100,000 miles a year, and Tesla has promised a 20-percent saving on the per-mile operating costs truckers pay now, estimating its new Semi will cost $1.26 per mile compared to what it says are industry standards of around $1.51 for diesel trucks.
Analysts, however, say the figures continue to evolve; the $1.51 cost assumes prices for diesel fuel and that fuel economy costs remain static.
They also say fuel efficiency for diesel trucks is expected to advance further, with a compounding improvement in the high single digits by 2020, potentially limiting the cost savings advantage suggested by Tesla.
""The problem is they (Tesla) are aiming at a moving target, and even with that the electric (trucks) would be lower cost (in terms of operation) but it wouldn't be quite as big a difference,"" Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann said.
Monkmeyer says the company is still mapping out costs, but believes the two trucks already look like they will be ""close enough"" to make the switch feasible. 
Still, he says larger concerns loom around Tesla's charging infrastructure and how hauliers plan to switch from pumps in depots to swift ""megacharging"" of electric vehicles.
""The biggest issue is going to be how is that grid provided and how is it supported and how quickly can we get a network out there for use nationwide, throughout North America, throughout the world,"" he says. 

""That's a big question mark. So that to me would be one limiting factor.""

Worry over increased interest rates rose earlier in the week after hawkish minutes from the Federal Reserve showed members saw an uptick in inflation. A recent batch of stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data has bolstered bets that the Fed could increase interest rates as many as four times this year, more than the three it currently forecasts.

1466,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 11:34AM ET</span>",General Mills moves into pet food with $8 billion Blue Buffalo deal,"By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - Cheerios cereal maker  General Mills  Inc (N:GIS) will buy  Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc  (O:BUFF) for nearly $8 billion, foraying into a fast-growing pet food market to counter declining sales of processed foods.
The acquisition announced Friday is the latest by a major food company seeking to expand in the $30 billion U.S. pet food market, while battling low demand for sugary, preservative-filled items.
""In pet food, as in human food, consumers are seeking more natural and premium products,"" General Mills Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said in a statement.
General Mills — home to Chex cereal and Yoplait yogurt — will pay $40 per Blue Buffalo share, representing a premium of 17.2 percent to the pet food company's Thursday closing price.
Blue Buffalo's shares were trading close to $40 on Friday morning, while General Mills' stock fell 3.7 percent.
Analysts said the deal was too costly. Blue Buffalo's stock had already climbed 58 percent in the past six months.
""We like the strategic merit but the price is steep and General Mills will have to work hard to extract value from the deal,"" Jefferies analyst Akshay Jagdale said.
He wondered if General Mills could properly fold in Blue Buffalo after having difficulties in growing Yoplait, in which it acquired a majority stake in 2011.
J.M.Smucker (N:SJM), Nestle, or a processed food maker seeking a foothold in the pet food industry could make a counter offer for Blue Buffalo, said Susquehanna analyst Pablo Zuanic.
However, opposing bids were unlikely given General Mills' high offer price, other analysts said.
BETS ON PETS
Other companies vying for a share of the lucrative pet-care industry include Mars, Cargill and Nestle (S:NESN).
Mars, which makes Pedigree and Whiskas pet foods, bought animal hospital firm VCA for $7.7 billion last year, while agriculture company Cargill snapped up pet food maker Pro-Pet. Nestle has called the industry a strategic high-growth area for investment.
U.S. retail pet food sales rose over three times as fast as the 1.2 percent growth in sales of packaged food last year, according to research firm Euromonitor.
Blue Buffalo, founded in 2002, rakes in more than $1 billion in yearly sales, benefiting from strong demand for its BLUE brand of dog and cat food made with whole meats, fruits and vegetables.
The Wilton, Connecticut company also led the U.S. pet care market in 2016 with a 6.1 percent share, Euromonitor said, up from zero just two years ago.
General Mills expects Blue Buffalo will help boost sales and add to its earnings within two years.
It will fund the acquisition with debt, cash on hand and about $1 billion in equity.
Blue Buffalo will operate as a separate unit within General Mills and its CEO Billy Bishop will continue to lead the business.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) was General Mills' financial adviser, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Centerview Partners advised Blue Buffalo.

Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP provided legal counsel to General Mills. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP advised Blue Buffalo.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 04:30AM ET</span>",Indian exchanges cut ties to foreign bourses after government nod: sources,"By Abhirup Roy and Rafael Nam
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's government fully endorses a dramatic move by domestic exchanges to cut off data to global bourses, sources familiar with the matter said, seeing it as vital to lure foreign investments into the country from Singapore and other financial centers.
It was only after receiving the endorsement that India's three private stock exchanges - National Stock Exchange,  BSE Ltd  (NS:BSEL) and MSEI Ltd - proceeded with the joint announcement on Feb. 10 to stop providing data to foreign rivals, said two senior officials at the bourses.
The sources declined to be identified because they were commenting on internal deliberations. 
A senior finance ministry official said New Delhi had held ""wide consultations"" on whether to support the exchanges' actions, and concluded it was needed to allow a new international finance center being set up in India ""to compete with Singapore and Dubai.""
""We have to balance the needs for domestic interests and our image in the global market,"" said the official, declining to be identified as he was not authorized to talk to media.
The move by the exchanges, blasted by index provider  MSCI Inc  (N:MSCI) as protectionist, reflects long-held wariness by Indian officials about the trading of Indian derivative products overseas, outside the ambit of domestic regulators.
The action is also a tactical move to lure foreign investors to an international financial center being developed in the western state of Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state.
Called Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, or GIFT City, the financial center has failed to gain much traction since INX, a unit of the Bombay Stock Exchange, became the first exchange to set up there last year, despite offering close to zero taxes, dollar contracts, and top notch infrastructure.
CAN IT WORK
The lack of activity has come even if there is much to appeal to foreign investors, at least on paper.
Located in a sprawling area a 40-minute drive from Gujarat's largest city, Ahmedabad, GIFT City is well equipped. 
It boasts of central cooling systems across all buildings and sophisticated IT networks and servers, even though it was eerily deserted when a Reuters team visited earlier this month.
Modi's government envisions a center with international schools, hotels, restaurants and even its own regulations, including allowing alcohol in a state that bans it. 
More importantly, GIFT City has no taxes on capital gains or transactions and no stamp duties. Most derivative contracts are also dollar-based, removing currency risks.
Yet whether the center can become a top-notch financial hub remains uncertain. 
For one, daily trading volumes are currently only at $300-$400 million across its equities, currency, debt, and commodity derivatives, a fraction of the tens of billions of dollars at India's main exchanges. 
Currently seven domestic banks operate in GIFT City, but no overseas lenders have set up.
The sources who talked to Reuters acknowledged the trading was largely from the banks' trading desks rather than from foreign investors. 
Regulatory uncertainty is also a concern. Although the government has sought a unified regulator for GIFT City, India has yet to decide on who, while a history of unpredictable regulations worries foreign investors. 
Furthermore, the Singapore Exchange (SGX), having emerged as the biggest trading center for offshore Indian derivatives and a top threat to India, is not standing still. 
It is exploring a tie-up with NSE in GIFT City, but is also working on ""successor products"" to its Indian equity index derivatives.
Tejas Desai, a partner at Ernst & Young, says foreign interest has increased after India exempted taxes on capital gains and after the action by Indian exchanges, giving GIFT City an opportunity to take advantage. 
""From a tax perspective, trading futures in GIFT city as compared to exchanges in mainland India is a no-brainer. Understandably, the level of interest amongst prospective investors is quite high at the moment,"" he said.

""However, the areas that investors will want to assess in greater detail are ease of access, on-boarding, product sophistication and presence of acclaimed brokers.""

The plans are part of the exchange's efforts to woo blockbuster Chinese companies to its market, including home tech giants such as  Alibaba  Group Holding (N:BABA) and Baidu (O:BIDU) that are listed in New York.
""We still have a lot of restrictions on companies that are listed in other jurisdictions (for secondary listing in Hong Kong) and we want to make changes to that,"" said Charles Li, chief executive of HKEX.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares steadied on Friday as investors digested a flurry of company results, including disappointing updates from Royal Bank of Scotland and  Valeo , while BT rallied after Britain's telecoms regulator set network access prices.
RBS (L:RBS) declined 4 percent after posting its first full-year profit since 2007. Traders said the underlying result missed expectations, while the lack of an update on a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for mis-selling toxic mortgage-backed securities also weighed. 
""It's taken a while but after many false dawns over the past decade, RBS has finally managed to return an annual profit, albeit a minor one... and for that we can thank the fact that the bank hasn't settled its outstanding dispute with the U.S. Department of Justice,"" said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.
French auto parts maker Valeo (PA:VLOF) slumped 9 percent to a six-month low, making it the biggest faller on the STOXX 600 (STOXX). Its second-half profit fell on adverse exchange rates and raw materials prices, prompting UBS to cut its price target on the stock 
The STOXX was up 0.06 percent by 0936 GMT. Among country indicators, the UK's FTSE (FTSE) dipped 0.2 percent and Germany's DAX (GDAXI) was up 0.06 percent. 
The STOXX is on course to end the week flat as markets stabilize and volatility calms following a turbulent start of the month that sent the index to a near-six-month low. It has since risen 3.5 percent from that level.
Elsewhere among financials,  Standard Life  Aberdeen (L:SLA) rose 1 percent after agreeing to sell the bulk of its insurance business to Phoenix Group (L:PHNX) for 3.24 billion pounds, while Swiss RE rose 2.1 percent after reporting better than expected 2017 net income.
Oil services firm  Subsea  7 (OL:SUBC) jumped 5 percent after news of joint venture talks with larger rival Schlumberger (N:SLB), which also supported shares in rival  Saipem  (MI:SPMI), up 2 percent.
Elsewhere in the energy sector, Neste (HE:NESTE) hit a record high following an upgrade from  Barclays  (LON:BARC), which said demand for renewable fuels should continue to increase. 
Telecoms were lifted by a 4 percent rise in BT Group (L:BT), after Britain's telecoms regulator OFCOM set a more generous cap on prices the company can charge rivals to use its fast broadband service. 
Berenberg analysts upgraded BT to buy from hold saying clarity over the investment case was set to improve and that its share prices already reflected ""fairly negative"" outcomes on regulation, its pension review, and capex risk.
The sector, which has been underperforming the broader market in the past few years on worries over competition, regulation and costly investment plans, was also boosted by gains in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) <.TLIT.MI> on heavy newsflow about possible dealmaking.
Three sources told Reuters that the Italian former phone monopoly had chosen Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to work on a spin-off of its fixed-line network.

Another source said Telecom Italia could ditch a proposed joint-venture with Canal+, the pay-TV arm of its top shareholder French media group  Vivendi  (PA:VIV).

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), a state-controlled regulator for the sector, has said it is probing whether auditors played a role in perpetrating the alleged $1.77 billion fraud that  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) unearthed last week. 
The ICAI said on Thursday it has asked the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and federal investigating agencies to share their findings about the alleged fraud, including anything related to the involvement of any chartered accountants.
The ICAI, which functions under the administrative control of India's Ministry of Corporate Affairs, said it has set up a committee to study the systemic lapses that contributed to the fraud and to suggest remedial measures and improvement.
Separately, the Economic Times newspaper reported that PNB has tapped PwC to conduct a probe into the alleged fraud that would help the bank build a case against jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. 
PNB officials were not immediately available for comment, while PwC declined to comment on the matter. 
Modi, his companies, and firms with links to his uncle Choksi, are at the center of the alleged fraud that involved illegally issued letters of undertaking (LoU) from PNB which were used to get credit from overseas branches of other, mostly Indian banks. 
The alleged fraud went undetected as the SWIFT interbank messaging system used to transmit the LoU was not integrated with PNB's core banking system (CBS), thus allowing the LoU to go unnoticed for years.
In what has been dubbed the biggest loan fraud in India's banking history, police have so far arrested at least a dozen people - six from the bank and six more from Modi's and Choksi's companies.
A lawyer for Modi has denied his client was involved in any fraud. Choksi has not commented but his firm,  Gitanjali Gems  (NS:GTGM), has also denied involvement in the alleged fraud.
BANKS SCRAMBLE
India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has asked other Indian banks with similar vulnerabilities as PNB to fix these issues by April 30, said Allahabad Bank's (NS:ALBK) Chief Executive Usha Ananthasubramanian. 
 Allahabad Bank , a state-run lender, said on Thursday that it is working on linking its core banking system with the SWIFT messaging service.
Responding to a question on whether the RBI had directed all banks to link their main banking systems with SWIFT by April 30, Ananthasubramanian said: ""Correct"".
""That is an outer limit, but today the urgency is such that may be I'll shelve one project aside and step into this and tell my vendor to fast track this,"" she told media on the sidelines of an industry event.

Shares in PNB, which have lost nearly 30 percent of their market capitalization since the fraud was made public, were down nearly 1 percent in afternoon trading on Friday.

1479,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 01:01AM ET</span>",Anbang Out With a Whimper Is No AIG Moment for China: Gadfly,"(Bloomberg Gadfly) -- Beijing's interventions in the economy don't always merit applause, but the government's unprecedented seizure of Anbang Insurance Group Co. deserves a round.
Anbang was a toxic threat to China's financial system after a debt-fueled global acquisition spree -- including trophy assets such as New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel -- that was funded by the sale of high-yield insurance policies. Those risky products propelled the company from obscurity into the ranks of the country's biggest insurers in the space of a few years.
The government will take temporary control of Anbang for a year starting Friday and prosecute its founder Wu Xiaohui for ""economic crimes,"" the China Insurance Regulatory Commission said in a statement. Wu, who was the company's chairman, was detained in June.
As I have written previously, the insurer was always going to crash and burn if left untouched. 
The heart of the Anbang dilemma is a duration mismatch. The company funded itself with the sale of short-term policies, some of which promised 8 percent returns in six months. The proceeds were often invested in long-term, hard-to-sell assets such as overseas real estate.
In its size and entanglement with China's financial system, Anbang is comparable to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. or American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG). in the U.S. before the global financial crisis. The company's total assets were equivalent to a staggering 3.4 percent of China's GDP, UBS Group AG analyst Jason Bedford estimated in a report in August.
By the end of last year's first quarter, Anbang was the country's second-largest insurer after state-owned China Life Insurance Co. Its voracious dealmaking included an aborted $15 billion bid for  Starwood Hotels  & Resorts Worldwide (NYSE:HOT) Inc. It was also once in talks to invest in 666 Fifth Ave. in New York, the marquee holding of Kushner Cos., the family company of President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
In May, though, an early sign of its downfall came when Anbang was restricted from selling the policies that had powered its growth. A month later, Wu, who was married to the granddaughter of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, was detained.
By taking control of Anbang, authorities reinforce the message that President Xi Jinping is determined to tamp down financial risk. They also buy themselves time to scale down and recapitalize this bloated monster.
Strip away the uncontrolled trophy collecting and there appears to be a viable business underneath. Just 11 percent of the asset base of Anbang's core entities was invested in illiquid holdings such as the Waldorf Astoria, according to UBS's Bedford. 
Markets reacted calmly to the announcement, underpinning the sense that regulators have acted in time to head off potentially bigger problems down the road. The Shanghai Composite Index was marginally higher at the midday break on Friday; shares of China Minsheng Banking Corp., in which Anbang is the largest shareholder, rose in Hong Kong.
While debt-fueled conglomerates have been in Beijing's cross-hairs, don't expect the Anbang takeover to set a precedent. For one thing, HNA Group Co. and Dalian Wanda Group Co. have slimmed down considerably since the government began signaling its concerns. For another, neither is nearly as entwined in the financial system as Anbang, which has policies held by millions of small investors.
This won't be an AIG moment for China. Rather, it's more likely to mark the demise of a single businessman who overreached. When he was raking in billions of yuan in premiums by selling policies like Longevity Sure Win No.1, Wu probably never imagined that the longevity he most needed to ensure was his own.

1480,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 01:01AM ET</span>","Exxon, BHP Axe Lengthy Sale of 50-Year-Old Australia Oil Fields","(Bloomberg) -- Two of the world’s biggest energy producers have abandoned the sale of some of Australia’s oldest oil fields after running a 20-month sales process.
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). and BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd. will retain ownership and operation of fields, licenses and associated infrastructure held in the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture after concluding a sale process, Exxon’s Esso Australia unit said Friday in a statement. The two companies reached a joint decision not to progress with the sale of offshore assets owned by the venture, a BHP spokesperson added in an email.
""After consideration of a range of options, we have currently decided to retain ownership and operation of these assets,"" Esso Australia, which operates the venture, said. BHP and Esso Australia each hold a 50 percent share. The JV began production in 1969, according to BHP.
Oil prices have recovered from a brutal bust earlier this decade that forced energy majors to either shut or sell aging fields as part of an industry wide cost-cutting drive. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has climbed 37 percent to about $66 a barrel since Exxon and Shell (LON:RDSa) first outlined their plan to sell the assets in June 2016.
Gippsland Basin fields that were marketed include Perch, Dolphin, Seahorse, Tarwhine, Kingfish A, Kingfish B, West Kingfish, Fortescue, Halibut, Cobia, Mackerel, Blackback and Flounder, Esso said in its 2016 statement. Kingfish, discovered in 1967, was the first offshore oil field discovered in Australia and remains the largest, according to Exxon."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Global stock picker Kerr Neilson, dubbed ""Australia's Warren Buffett,"" said he will step down as chief executive officer of listed fund manager Platinum Investment Management (AX:PTM), sending its shares almost 12 percent lower.
""It really is time for me to focus on fewer things and do those well, rather than try and cover this whole global investing scenario,"" Neilson told Reuters on Friday.
Neilson, who founded the fund with the backing of U.S. investor George Soros 24 years ago and became one of Australia's richest men overnight when he floated it in 2007, will remain executive director.
But his departure from day-to-day business, wiping as much as A$800 million ($626 million) from the market capitalization of Platinum, illustrates the vulnerability of fund managers in particular to ""key man risk,"" since it can trigger clients to pull their assets. 
Bill Gross's abrupt departure from United States asset manager PIMCO in 2014 sent funds flowing away from the group, while BlueBay, one of Europe's biggest asset managers, closed a $1.4 billion hedge fund the same year when manager Neil Phillips left.
Platinum shares posted their sharpest drop in three years on Friday, dropping as much as 17.5 percent to a four-month low of A$6.45. They closed 12 percent lower while the broader market (AXJO) rose 0.8 percent. 
""Of course they'll lose some mandates but they're big enough for that,"" said Geoff Wilson, founder and chairman at Wilson Asset Management (AX:WAM), which holds Platinum shares. 
Platinum has A$27.1 billion in funds under management and announced Nielson's departure with its half-year results, which beat analyst expectations, after the market closed on Thursday.
Neilson has focused the fund on Asian investments, but said a mid-1990s investment in  IBM  (N:IBM), and timely purchases of  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) are among his best-performing picks.
""The tech bubble we played beautifully; we've been quite good at big turning points,"" he said.
""Then the big balls-ups: I stayed too long in my shorts the whole of 2008 onwards,"" he said listing Walmart (NYSE:WMT) as a short target that had soared.
""But we've outperformed even with that ... so there's a system in the stock selection here that is pretty robust.""
Neilson, who steps down on July 1, will be replaced as chief executive by younger co-founder Andrew Clifford. Neilson said he closely studied individual stocks, often paying as much A$600 per hour to interview former executives.
""You get a profile that is much deeper than simply the numbers,"" Neilson said.
""We try to find when there's been a disproportionate action to an event and then the analysis lies in assessing whether that event is character-changing or not.""

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 02:00AM ET</span>","GM Korea seeks to trim benefits, wages: internal letter","By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) will propose a base wage freeze and no bonuses this year along with a suspension of some worker benefits at its money-losing South Korean unit to cut costs, according to an internal letter that Reuters reviewed on Friday.
GM is bracing for a major showdown with its South Korean unionised workers, after the U.S. automaker announced last week it would shut a plant by May in the city of Gunsan, in southwest South Korea, and decide the future of its remaining three plants in the country within weeks. 
GM executives have complained that South Korea's relatively high wages and unyielding unions have contributed to its problems in the country. 
To ""improve the manufacturing competitiveness of GM Korea,"" GM will propose freezing base wages this year and limit future wage increases below inflation, the letter said.
""It is impossible to pay 2018 bonuses/one-time payments in 2018,"" GM said in the letter, sent to team leaders, laying out proposals for this year's wage talks with the union.
GM Korea has paid about 10 million won ($9,285.83) in bonuses to each worker almost every year, company officials have said.
The proposal includes suspending benefits, such as school tuition for employees' children, gold medals and travel expenses for long-serving workers, and free lunches.
GM has told its South Korean employees the company should trim benefits worth a combined 300 billion won, two sources told Reuters. One of the sources said GM has also asked employees to curb use of corporate cards. 
A GM Korea spokesman declined to comment, while a union spokeswoman said it has not officially received the proposal.
TEMPORARY RELIEF
Meanwhile, GM on Friday dropped a request to use its South Korean factory in Bupyeong as collateral for debt, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
At around 5 percent interest, GM headquarters in Detroit has lent its South Korean unit nearly 3 trillion won, out of which 700 billion won comes due at the end of this month. 
At a board meeting of its South Korean unit, GM also agreed to grant temporary relief in repaying the 700 billion won debt until the government completes its due diligence of the unit, the person with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
South Korea said on Thursday it plans to quickly conduct due diligence on GM's S.Korean operations and would discuss whether the government would provide financial support to the company. 
This came after GM agreed to play ""a responsible role"" in normalising its South Korean operations while other stakeholders also ""share the pain.""
""GM told board members that there is progress with its talks with the government, but little progress with talks with its labour union, which is a problem,"" said the person with direct knowledge of the matter. 
GM has been seeking concessions from the South Korean union, and government support to engineer a turnaround. 
South Korea was once a major export base for GM, but saw slumping sales in recent years as GM scrapped its Chevy brand in Europe. 

The ruling party on Friday urged GM to come up with a “viable, long-term turnaround plan” for its South Korean operations.

1484,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 09:53PM ET</span>",Asian Equities Advance; Japan's CPI In Focus,"Investing.com - Asian stocks advanced in morning trading Friday to end the week on a positive note as the Dow and the S&P 500 reversed some of its midweek pullback, while comments from a Federal Reserve official eased concerns of speeding up rate hikes this year.
The U.S. markets were little changed Thursday, as the Dow added 0.7 percent, the S&P 500 closed just in the green, while the Nasdaq lost 0.11 percent. St Louis Fed President James Bullard warned that too many rate hikes this year would restrict economy growth, and that he did not expect the years of below-target inflation to change rapidly.
Japan’s CPI was in focus as the data showed inflation rose 0.9% in January from a year earlier, compared with a median market forecast of 0.8%. The data brought some uncertainty over the economic outlook as it showed the country’s inflation remains distant from the central bank’s 2% target. The yen was pressured by the stalling inflation as USD/JPY gained 0.10% to $106.86 by 10am ET. The Nikkei was up 0.34%.  Takata Corp  (OTC:TKTDQ) received some focus as the airbag maker reached a $650 million deal to settle consumer protection claims in the States.
Mainland Chinese markets extended their gains after surging more than 2% yesterday. Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component jumped 0.62% and 0.34% higher respectively. Anbang Insurance made headlines as China’s Insurance Regulatory Commission said it would take control of the company for one year as the company had illegal business operations that may harm its solvency, and had asked the company to remove Wu Xiaohui from its chairman role. China’s January property prices data is due tomorrow.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index clawed back some of its losses today and gained 1.4%. Wynn received some focus as U.S. regulators said the investigation was still ongoing and would be a priority. Hong Kong-listed  Wynn Macau  's (HK:1128) share price was up 1.13% to $26.75.
Elsewhere, Australis’ S&P/ASX 200 was trading up 0.6% to 5,986.5, supported by the materials sector."
1485,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 10:00PM ET</span>",Airbnb CEO pledges to take more responsibility for impact to housing,"By Heather Somerville
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Home-booking company Airbnb has sparred with regulators across the globe, but Chief Executive Brian Chesky on Thursday spoke of coming to terms with his responsibility for how the company can impact housing markets and neighborhoods.
""Every year I think you have a sense you have even more responsibility than the year before,"" Chesky said in an interview with Reuters. 
Chesky's view represents a striking evolution for the company, which just a few years ago defended itself as a passive technology platform, not responsible for what homes it listed or how they were used. 
""When Airbnb started 10 years ago it was kind of the culture that you really can't take responsibility for what happens on your platform,"" he said. ""We changed our point of view."" 
Things are certainly different for Airbnb from when it began as a scrappy website for renting an air mattress on a stranger's floor. Chesky said on Thursday that Airbnb's revenue grew more than 50 percent from the end of 2016 to the end of 2017.
A person familiar with the matter previously told Reuters that Airbnb's revenue last year topped $2.5 billion, about $1 billion of which occurred in the fourth quarter. 
Chesky spoke to Reuters during an event at Airbnb headquarters in San Francisco, where the company announced new luxury services to attract more high-end travelers and unveiled a large-scale redesign of the company's 4.5 million property listings to make it easier for travelers to find what they want. 
Chesky said the company trimmed fat from its core home-renting business so it could turn a profit last year to invest in the new products and technology. Part of that was weeding out problematic hosts and guests - a single-digit percentage of all users ""who tend to become very costly"" because Airbnb generally reimburses those who have a bad experience, Chesky said.
With a $31 billion valuation, privately held Airbnb for years has been considered a contender for an initial public offering, but Chesky said the company will not go public this year, partly due to the departure this month of its chief financial officer, Laurence Tosi. Still, Chesky said Airbnb will complete IPO preparations by year-end, including hiring a new CFO and bringing on more independent directors.
Another task, Chesky said, is to ensure he has a solid understanding of how Airbnb's business can alter neighborhoods and housing markets ""before there is a giant magnifying glass on you"" in the public markets.
The company has battled regulators in cities from Berlin to Paris and Miami, but its spat with its hometown of San Francisco was among the most bitter.
""We don't want the history of San Francisco, which was a very difficult history over the last seven years, to happen in every city,"" Chesky said.
In lawsuits against San Francisco and other cities, Airbnb invoked Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act, a 20-year-old statute designed to protect free speech online, to argue it should not be regulated.
But Airbnb last May settled its lawsuit with San Francisco, which was over a local ordinance forbidding home-rental companies from taking bookings for hosts who have not properly registered their homes. The settlement included Airbnb's creating a registration system for anyone in the city who wants to rent out a room or house on its site. The result was thousands fewer Airbnb listings in San Francisco.
Airbnb, however, is still engaged in lawsuits with the cities of Santa Monica, California, and Miami.
Chesky said executives at technology platforms - including companies like Facebook (O:FB) and Twitter (N:TWTR) - need to better appreciate that when they have millions or billions of users, ""every little decision has a massive impact on the world."" 

""This is a huge amount of responsibility and I think we are all coming to terms with this responsibility,"" Chesky said.

1486,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 09:01PM ET</span>",Chinese Shares on Shaky Ground as Investors Favor Just a Few,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s stock market wasn’t in great shape even before the past month’s slide.
The rally leading into it was driven by a few dominant industry players, favored by investors concerned that smaller companies would be squeezed by higher funding costs and a slowing economy. In the 12 months through Jan. 24, when the Shanghai index peaked, only a third of onshore Chinese stocks rose. Excluding those that listed in 2017 and this year, four out of five dropped.
The lack of breadth meant that when sentiment turned, the market’s source of upward momentum disappeared as everyone rushed to exit the same stocks at once. After climbing 13 percent over the preceding year, the Shanghai Composite Index plunged 12 percent in a little over two weeks.
“Investors’ strategies have turned the market into an ETF,” said Wu Yuefeng, a Beijing-based fund manager at Fundin Capital Management Co., which oversees about 2 billion yuan ($315 million). “If this continues on a large scale, it wouldn’t be surprising to see sharp gains followed by sharp declines.”
The structural imbalance is unlikely to change for now, suggesting more volatility ahead for the already notoriously wild Chinese stock market. When mainland markets reopened Thursday after the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, consumer giants including Kweichow Moutai Co. outperformed. In the 12 months through Jan. 24, Moutai’s share price more than doubled. In the next two weeks, it tumbled 11 percent. The liquor maker rose 1.4 percent Friday morning, while the Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.3 percent.
Blue Chips Favored
Slowing economic growth and tighter liquidity tend to benefit Chinese companies that are dominant in their industries. The earnings growth of small caps has cooled and the effects of the 2015 boom and bust linger: even after two straight years of declines, the ChiNext gauge of venture enterprises is more than twice as pricey as the large-cap CSI 300 Index.
Last year, top-performing funds staked large bets in blue-chip companies, which Chinese investors like to call white-horse stocks. The strategy was especially profitable and convenient for private funds unconstrained by 10 percent concentration limits, as well as massive mutual funds in search of liquid stocks -- a multi-asset fund raised almost 33 billion yuan in a day in January, Securities Times reported.
The low volatility of large caps also prompted some investors to add leverage to boost returns, exacerbating their declines during the selloff, according to Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong. Before the rout, the outstanding margin balance had reached the highest since early 2016.
“The positioning is very extreme,” he said. “Stability has made them a good target for leverage. Leverage has made them vulnerable.”
Hong said small caps will catch up this year as regulators seek to spread gains across the market and the so-called National Team pares positions in large caps. The CSI 300’s level relative to ChiNext has slipped since the selloff began, though it remains near the highest since 2013.
Fundin’s Wu said it will take a while for small caps to become attractive to investors again and it will be harder to find good picks this year. In his view, large caps are still the way to go for now.
“Gains in the index may be less pronounced this year,” he said. “As small caps’ valuations become more reasonable and earnings improve, they’ll be noticed by investors again. After their risks are cleared, the market will be healthier and the foundation of a bull market stronger.”

1487,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 23, 2018 05:04AM ET</span>",Global stocks stay subdued as dollar edges higher,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - A stronger dollar and slightly higher global borrowing costs kept world shares subdued on Friday and left gold limping toward its worst week since December.
Europe's main London, Frankfurt and Paris markets <0#.INDEXE> barely budged in early moves, keeping MSCI's 47- country world index just in the black on the day but facing its third red week in the last four.
Modest gains for the dollar meant the euro was set to post its second biggest weekly loss in nearly four months [/FRX], as caution over the Italian election gave bond markets there their toughest week of 2018. 
Polls point to a hung parliament in Italy, where no one party or coalition has an outright majority to form a government, and analysts expect a short-term volatility that could weigh on traditionally sensitive euro zone markets.
Italy's 10-year bond yield was up 1 bps at 2.09 percent. It has risen about 10 basis points this week.
""Some long-forgotten patterns return to euro bond markets with Bunds rallying while Italy sells off,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) rates strategist Christoph Rieger.
He noted comments from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker this week, who was reported to have warned about Italian election risks.
Broader global cross-asset issues remained much the same as they have during a choppy few weeks. How far and fast U.S. interest rates can rise and what would it mean for global borrowing costs, risk appetite and business confidence.
That caution is reverberating in the bond markets with U.S. yields rising by more than 50 basis points since early December, more than the 38 basis points for German government debt.
Benchmark Treasury 10-year note yields rose to a four-year high of 2.957 percent on Wednesday though they were a shade down at 2.904 percent on Friday.
The backsliding also stalled the dollar's overnight gains in Asia. It was virtually treading water against most major currencies by 0930 GMT, buying 106.8 yen and at $1.2325 and $1.3965 against the euro and pound.
It was still up more than 1 percent for the week and headed for its third gain in the last four weeks.
""We think the Fed could well put U.S. (interest) rates up four times this year but even then it only takes U.S. rates to 2.5 by the end of the year,"" said JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management global strategist Mike Bell. ""So the question is would they continue at that pace in 2019?"" 
One of the Fed's chief doves, St Louis Fed President James Bullard, tried to tamp down expectations of four rate hikes on Thursday, saying policymakers needed to be careful not to slow the economy.
NOT SO PRECIOUS
Russian markets were readying for a big day with S&P Global due to review Moscow's credit rating.
It is just one step away from returning Russia to the investment grade bracket that it ejected it from after the 2014-2015 slump in oil prices and Ukraine crisis. Its restatement would also see Russian foreign currency bonds return to some widely-tracked bond indices. 
In Asian trading overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.9 percent on Friday to add to the previous week's 3.9 percent gain.
It is still down more than 4 percent in February so far, however, after global equity markets were mauled at the start of the month by worries that inflation was picking up. 
Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7 percent, though China's SSE (LON:SSE) Composite index and the blue-chip CSI300 both pared their early gains after the government seized control of acquisitive financial conglomerate Anbang Insurance.
It was seen as a dramatic move that underscores Beijing's intent to crackdown on financial risk.
The dollar's strength meant it remained a tough environment for commodities which are priced in the U.S. currency.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.74 a barrel, down 3 cents from their last settlement, while Brent crude futures were down 2 cents at $66.37 a barrel.
There were concerns about high U.S. crude export levels which outweighed an unexpected drop in oil inventories in the country which is also the world's biggest fuel consumer.
Industrial metals such as copper eased as they headed for a small weekly drop and as trading slowly picked up again after Chinese markets had been shut following the Lunar New Year holiday.
Gold remained the stand-out mover though and looking increasingly less precious. 
Its spot market price was down 0.2 percent at $1,328, heading for a fifth session of falls in six. It has shed 1.6 percent this week, its biggest drop since early December.
""We remain somewhat cautious on gold over the short term given that we think the dollar rally is still not over, especially in the light of U.S. Treasury yields remaining elevated,"" said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.

Sharp had withdrawn a Federal lawsuit and an action filed with a U.S. trade body as of Thursday, the Nikkei said, without citing sources.
In September, the U.S. International Trade Commission had agreed to probe certain Wi-Fi enabled devices and their parts after Sharp accused Hisense of infringing its patents.
A Sharp spokesman declined to comment on Friday, while Hisense in Tokyo had no immediate comment.
The two electronics makers had been in dispute, with Sharp, which had licensed Hisense to use its brand to sell televisions in the United States, suing the Chinese state-owned firm for putting the Sharp name on what it has called low-quality TVs.

Sharp, which had reduced its overseas TV business, has said it would re-enter the U.S. market with a high-end television brand.

1. European Inflation To Help Euro Avoid Weekly Loss?
The Eurozone release its final consumer price index (CPI) reading for January on Friday. A stronger than expected CPI print could renew investor expectations the central bank could tighten monetary policy measures sooner rather than lighter after the release of somewhat dovish ECB minutes Thursday. 
The minutes showed that the central bank continued to believe that patience was needed as inflation remained weak and agreed that it was still “premature” to adjust forward guidance. 
Economists forecast an unchanged final reading for Eurozone inflation of 1.3% for January compared to 1.4% in the prior month.
EUR/USD rose 0.39% to $1.2331 as the greenback fell sharply weighed by a fall in bond yields after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard downplayed the chances of the Fed raising rates four times this year. 
2. Canadian Inflation To Confirm Canada’s Economy Slowing
Canadian Inflation is expected show pricing pressure remained subdued in January amid growing signs that the economy is slowing after retail sales released Thursday fell well short of forecasts.
Economist forecast consumer price inflation in December fell 0.5%, compared to 0.1% decline in the previous month. 
TD Securities said Thursday's negative retail sales print supports its call for “only two rate hike in 2018,” with the next hike expected as late as July given that the economy has “clearly cooled” and that the medium-term economic outlook is facing several domestic headwinds.
USD/CAD rose by 0.06% to C$1.2711.
3. Crude To Notch Second Straight Week of Gains? 
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US jumped by seven to 798, the highest level since April 2, 2015. 
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Crude futures settled higher on Thursday as traders cheered data showing weekly crude supplies unexpectedly fell for the first time in four weeks. 
Some said, however, that the surprise draw in crude supplies was supported by added incentive to sell rather than store crude as current prices traded at a premium to forward prices – a market structure known as backwardation."
1494,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",Japan's Equity Faithful Want Foreigners to Revive Market Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- Japanese retail investors bought domestic stocks for a fourth consecutive week, stoking hope that foreign buyers will join them in helping the market make a full recovery from a rout that started last month.
Individual investors last week added to their record net purchases of the nation’s stocks, yet foreigners were net sellers for a sixth straight week. Overseas players -- who generated 68 percent of the market’s equity trading value last month -- have to start buying more if Japan’s equity benchmark is to rebound from its 10 percent correction, analysts said.
“The market won’t resume its rising trend unless foreign buyers come back,” said Norihiro Fujito, a senior strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Buying by Japan’s individual investors can work as a shock absorber for the market as it reduces the downside risks.”
Japan’s individual investors bought 85.1 billion yen ($791 million) more shares than they sold in trading at the Tokyo and Nagoya securities exchanges in the week ended Feb. 16, according to data released Thursday. That came after a record net buying of 745.8 billion yen in the week ended on Feb. 9, an amount that exceeded purchases in 1987 during the week of Black Monday.
A global equity meltdown sent the Nikkei 225 Stock Average to a four-month low last week, attracting retail investors who have traditionally used a contrarian approach, according to Hisao Matsuura, a strategist with Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo. Retail investors tend to buy on dips and sell on rallies after having suffered heavy losses during the lost decades following the asset-bubble burst of the early 1990s, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley’s Fujito said.
“Individual investors’ buying could be temporary,” Nomura’s Matsuura said. “If stocks rise considerably, then they may become sellers. Their contrarian strategy is unlikely to change anytime soon.”
Foreigners may start buying Japanese stocks when U.S. Treasury yields stop rising, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley’s Fujito said. They sold a net 36.2 billion yen of Japanese shares in the week ended on Feb. 16, following 644.6 billion yen of selling in the previous week, the biggest reduction since March 2016. Ten-year Treasury yields reached 2.95 percent on Wednesday, their highest level since January 2014.
“It may take some more time until foreign investors return to the Japanese stock market as buyers,” Fujito said. “If Treasury yields break above 3 percent, it may spur a risk-off mode in the global markets and foreigners probably won’t buy Japanese stocks. On the other hand, if yields stabilize in a range between 2.7 and 2.8 percent, they may come back.”"

1501,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 06:29PM ET</span>",BlackRock puts gunmakers on notice after Florida school shooting,"By Ross Kerber and Trevor Hunnicutt
BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world's largest asset manager put U.S. gunmakers on notice on Thursday that it is no longer business as usual in the wake of a shooting that killed 17 at a Florida high school.
BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) said it will speak with weapons manufacturers and distributors ""to understand their response"" to the second-deadliest shooting at a public school in U.S. history, putting pressure on companies such as Sturm Ruger & Company Inc and American Outdoor Brands Corp. 
BlackRock is the largest shareholder in both gunmakers and has more than $6 trillion in assets under management. It stopped short of saying it would divest its funds of gun companies, however.
Underlining how the Valentine’s Day massacre at the Florida high school has rattled the finance industry’s relationship with gunmakers, First National Bank of Omaha said separately on Thursday it would not renew a contract with the National Rifle Association (NRA) to issue a NRA-branded Visa card. The NRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Gun control activists have campaigned in recent days for everything from banning semi-automatic guns like the one used in the Florida shooting to asking public pension funds to sell gun stocks.
New Jersey legislators on Thursday said they plan to introduce bills to bar state pension funds from investing in gun manufacturers.
BlackRock said it cannot sell shares of a company in an index, given its fiduciary responsibilities. Instead, ""We focus on engaging with the company and understanding how they are responding to society's expectations of them,"" BlackRock spokesman Ed Sweeney said in an email.
Sweeney declined to give more specifics, such as what if any changes BlackRock might seek at weapons makers or at retailers that sell their products.
But with so much money under management, BlackRock often has among the largest stakes in U.S. public companies, giving it much potential influence over their policies.
It owns about 17 percent of the total shares of Sturm Ruger and has about 11 percent of American Outdoor Brands, for instance, according to U.S. regulatory filings. The shares are largely held in funds that track indexes, such as the $6 billion iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF.
BlackRock and other large index fund managers carry clout partly through their proxy votes, such as for directors and on matters brought to a vote by shareholders. 
Both American Outdoor and Sturm Ruger for instance face shareholder resolutions calling for them to report on their efforts related to gun safety, according to a list of resolutions kept by the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility.
Representatives for American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Shares in both companies rallied on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump advocated tightening background checks for guns in response to the most recent school shooting.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in January wrote a letter to corporate executives saying that companies need to show how they make ""a positive contribution to society"" in addition to delivering financial performance.
And he said that BlackRock would increase its own engagement with companies to improve its oversight over those companies, doubling to 64 the number of people it has dedicated to ""investment stewardship,"" its team that focuses on other company's governance.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of gunmakers American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger & Company rallied on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump advocated tightening background checks for guns in response to last week's high school massacre in Florida.
The Republican president's tweets and comments were seen as increasing the possibility of greater curbs on gun ownership, fueling expectation that people might seek to stock up on guns in advance of any changes. 
Both of those sentiments had dipped since Trump was elected in November 2016 - illustrating a paradox under which a president viewed as more favorable to gun ownership can depress gun sales and shares in gunmakers.
""What Trump has been saying is a complete surprise,"" said Aegis Capital analyst Rommel Dionisio, who covers firearms makers. ""The prevailing wisdom for Republican presidents is not to be pro-gun control.""
Under Democratic President Barack Obama, firearm sales hit record levels as people stocked up, thinking the government might tighten gun control laws. Mass shootings that took place during Obama's eight years in office from 2009 bolstered that expectation even more, often sending shares of gunmakers surging in the immediate aftermath of such events. (http://reut.rs/2EIW0RP)
Sales and stock prices of firearms makers slumped after Trump's unexpected election victory was seen as reducing prospects for curbs on gun ownership. Sturm Ruger's stock has fallen 22 percent since the 2016 election, and American Outdoor Brands has lost 63 percent of its value.
But tweets and comments by Trump on Wednesday and Thursday that he supported raising the age limit for purchases of some kinds of guns, as well as other measures, turned up the heat on the gun control debate, and boosted gunmakers' shares. 
Sturm Ruger rose 3.6 percent, while American Outdoor Brands jumped as much as 7.9 percent before ending with an increase of 0.6 percent.
Nevertheless, Trump took a pro-gun stance in advocating arming some schoolteachers to prevent school shootings. Also fueling the gun control debate, National Rifle Association chief executive Wayne LaPierre in a speech on Thursday described control advocates as elites aiming to ""eradicate all personal freedoms.""
Reflecting the gun industry slump under Trump, Sturm Ruger reported a 27 percent fall in revenue for the December quarter on Wednesday.
Ruger laid off 50 workers in January, and in its quarterly report it said it was slashing its capital expenditures plan for 2018 by more than half, suggesting the Southport, Connecticut, company expects its business to remain difficult. 

Seventeen students and staff members were killed in the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, a massacre that has fueled unprecedented youth-led protests in cities across the country. Many of the teens and their parents are calling for greater gun control.

Aside from a brief spike, the euro stayed relatively calm after the summary of January’s Governing Council meeting was released on Thursday. That’s in contrast to the report on December’s session, which rocked currency and bond markets when it suggested that officials might move faster than expected toward reining in stimulus.
That outcome should be a relief for President Mario Draghi. He’s shown a reluctance to allow too much discussion of potential policy changes in recent meetings, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. The general concern is that any sign of a looming shift in stance could stoke market volatility and undermine the ECB’s stimulus plans.
“Draghi certainly brought the discussion back to where it should be,” said Anatoli Annenkov, an economist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA in London. “It’s a reminder for the ECB staff that one has to write these accounts with a lot of care, but it’s also a wake-up call for them to consider how you want to write those accounts in the future.”
Style Change
An ECB spokesman declined to comment on the Governing Council’s meetings. Draghi played down any divisions after the Jan. 25 gathering, saying there are no “deep, existential differences.”
While Thursday’s summary was subdued, reiterating the intention to only change policy language gradually as the inflation outlook improves, it did reflect opposing views. The document noted that some policy makers were ready to remove a pledge to expand the bond-buying program if needed. Their argument: The stronger economy warrants a more substantial discussion over the prospects of monetary policy.
The line that sparked investor upheaval after the previous report was phrased more carefully this time around. The ECB reiterated that it could review its policy guidance “early” in 2018, but added a qualifier.
The euro fluctuated in a 0.3 percentage point range after the account was published, but quickly stabilized. It traded up 0.4 percent at $1.2330 on the day at 6:14 p.m. Frankfurt time.
The accounts, published for the first time in February 2015 after months of trials, were intended to improve transparency. While they have helped officials reinforce the message that unprecedented stimulus was needed, the approaching policy shift has turned compiling them into a headache.
ECB staff must parse the discussions of 25 Governing Council members and summarize them -- the complete record is kept secret for 30 years -- while also reflecting the balance of opinion, and the document is examined by the national central banks.
Views aren’t attributed to individual officials, except for Executive Board members Peter Praet and Benoit Coeure, who give opening presentations. Phrases such as “widely agreed” and “some members” are used to give a general sense of the extent of support for each view.
That process takes four weeks, and as the account of the December meeting showed, doesn’t always get the calm market reception that was intended."

1509,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 04:05PM ET</span>",Five ways millennial caregivers can find help,"By Andrea Januta
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amanda Singer had her plate full running a dance studio in Massachusetts.
But after her mother underwent emergency surgery and radiation for breast cancer late last year, Singer, 28, unexpectedly found herself taking on an even bigger responsibility – the role of unpaid family caregiver. 
Singer is one of millions of millennial caretakers in the United States. 
While most of her peers are focused on their careers or relationships, Singer spends twelve hours a day, three days a week, keeping her mother company and helping with household tasks like grocery shopping. 
Singer has put her romantic life on hold, and said her social life is ""not even existent.""
Millennial caregivers are a hidden group bucking the stereotype for their generation.
""There's a pervasive myth that millennials are narcissistic and that they're selfish,"" said Feylyn Lewis, a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Sussex, whose work focuses on young adult caregivers in the U.S. 
This stereotype makes it challenging for millennial caregivers to get the recognition and help they need, she said.
There are about 40 million caregivers in the United States, according to a 2015 study by the AARP. In 2013, they contributed approximately $470 billion of unpaid work to the economy. 
While the typical caregiver tends to be a middle-aged woman, millennials form nearly a quarter of the caregiving population. 
Below are five steps to help millennials cope with caregiving, which can often be emotionally and physically demanding.
YOU ARE NOT ALONE
Rebekah Beeton, 21, spent much of her life caring for her mother, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis the year Beeton was born. 
Beeton remembers helping with daily activities like fixing her mother's hair at age 10. At 17, she became the primary caregiver alongside her father until her mother's death in December. 
""I remember feeling very alone sometimes, that no one else was going through what I was going through,"" said Beeton. 
Though support groups skew toward older generations, millennials can connect online with caregivers their age. 
Beeton found support through the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and Joni and Friends, a religious organization for those with disabilities and their families. 
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
""The guilt will kill you,"" said Tiffany Marcum, 33, who moved in with her father to care for him in 2015 as his dementia progressed. 
Until her father's death in January, Marcum would lay out his clothes before waking him each morning, then walk him through getting dressed, help him take his medication and prepare him for his daytime care center. She worked full time and spent evenings after work caring for him as well.
Despite doing all that she could, Marcum still felt guilty for not doing more. 
""I was frustrated, and felt bad that I felt frustrated and guilty,"" Marcum said.
For Marcum, therapy and anti-depressants were helpful. She also recommends being honest about your feelings in support groups. 
Self care is critical. When a caregiver is too focused on others, they can neglect their own needs and burn out. Get plenty of rest and take breaks, when possible.
PLAN YOUR FINANCES
Without preparation, millennials who take time off to care for a loved one may not have their own money set aside for the future, including retirement, said Grace Whiting, chief executive of the non-profit National Alliance for Caregiving.
""Millennials have to plan for the financial part, as they're getting older, too,"" Whiting said.
Organizations including the Alzheimer's Association (http://alz.org/) and the Women's Institute for a Secure Retirement (http://www.wiserwomen.org/) provide resources to help caregivers prepare for long-term financial sustainability. 
KNOW YOUR STATE'S DISCRIMINATION LAWS 
The average millennial caregiver is employed and works 34.9 hours a week, according to the AARP. But caregiving can get in the way of career advancement. 
""Millennials are trying to get started in their careers,"" said Lewis. ""If you need to take time off for work or if you're late for work, your caregiving is starting to impact the role you have.""
Different states have different laws protecting caregivers from discrimination. You can find more about your rights on AARP's website (https://www.aarp.org/caregiving/).
AVOID COMPARISONS WITH PEERS
Every millennial caregiver's life changes in different ways, so avoid comparing yourself with others. 
Beeton, who got a college degree online to continue caregiving, reminds herself that it is okay if she hits milestones at different times than her peers.

Beeton knew her mom would not be around forever. She would remind herself: ""This is what life's about right now.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Hyundai Motor  Co's (KS:005380) Genesis brand topped the annual ranking of new vehicles by influential U.S. magazine Consumer Reports, while General Motors Co's (N:GM) electric Chevrolet Bolt was named top pick for compact green car.
Millions of prospective auto buyers consult the magazine's rankings, which are based on road testing, reliability, safety and owner satisfaction scores.
Hyundai has created a fledgling new luxury brand, Genesis, and the Consumer Reports rankings are based on just two models.
Reuters reported last week that some potential buyers of Tesla’s long-delayed Model 3 sedan are concerned they will miss out on big federal tax breaks and are looking for alternatives like the Bolt. GM sold 23,297 Bolts in 2017.
Tesla has told some holders of Model 3 reservations that they would not get their cars until 2019. Frustrated Tesla buyers, afraid that waiting could cost them a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, have factored into brisk demand for Bolts, according to GM dealers in California, the top U.S. market for electric vehicles.
Volkswagen AG's (DE:VOWG_p) Audi luxury unit was ranked second among brands. The VW brand was 16th and its Porsche brand was fifth.
BMW AG (DE:BMWG) ranked third, with Toyota Motor Corp's (T:7203) Lexus brand fourth. Kia Motors Corp (KS:000270) was sixth, followed by Subaru Corp (T:7270), Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and Honda Motor Co's (T:7267) Honda brand. The Toyota brand was in 10th place.
Toyota had four of the top 10 vehicle picks on the list, the most of any automaker, with the Corolla, Camry, Highlander and Sienna taking honors. Toyota's vehicles had the top scores for predicted reliability.
U.S. brands lagged other automakers, but the  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) Chrysler brand ranked 11th. The automaker’s Fiat unit finished last among 34 brands rated, with its Ram brand 26th, Dodge 27th and Jeep brand in 33rd place. 
GM’s top-selling Chevrolet brand ranked 23rd, while the Cadillac brand ranked 24th and GMC 28th.

Ford Motor Co’s (N:F) Ford brand ranked 20th and its Lincoln brand 17th, but its best-selling F-150 pickup truck was named best pickup.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Takata Corp's U.S. unit agreed Thursday to settle a probe by 44 state attorneys general into claims it concealed a deadly safety defect with air bag inflators.
TK Holdings Inc, which is in bankruptcy reorganization proceedings, agreed in the settlement to a $650 million civil penalty over the defect linked to at least 22 deaths. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said in a statement that because Takata does not have the money, the states ""agreed not to collect this civil penalty in order to maximize the recovery available to consumers who were the victims.""
In February 2017, Takata pleaded in a U.S. federal court to a felony charge as part of a $1 billion settlement that included compensation funds for automakers and victims of its faulty air bag inflators in connection with the largest automotive recall in history. 
The company’s air bag inflators can inflate with too much force and spray metal fragments. Three former senior Takata executives were charged in January 2017 with falsifying test results but none have appeared in a U.S. court.
The company agreed in the settlement to ""not represent that its airbags are safe unless supported by competent and reliable scientific or engineering evidence"" and ""not falsify or manipulate testing data, or provide any testing data that the companies know is inaccurate."" 
On Friday, a lawyer for TK Holdings said the company is on the verge of receiving court approval for its reorganization and $1.6 billion sale of its non-air bag businesses.
At the start of a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware, lawyer Marcia Goldstein told the court that Takata's U.S. unit had resolved nearly all objections to the reorganization.
The judge will hear from some objectors before reaching any decision.
Takata and TK Holdings Inc filed for bankruptcy last year in the wake of the recall. The company has said it has recalled, or plans to recall, about 125 million inflators worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States.
As part of the company’s bankruptcy plan, automakers are contributing between $80 million and $130 million to help compensate those injured.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell slightly on Thursday as a flurry of corporate results failed to lift sentiment after a new wave of speculation about faster hikes in U.S interest rates soured risk appetite globally. 
An hour after the open, the publication of the German business confidence index, which fell more than expected in February, and a downward revision in UK economic growth cemented the gloom, although a rebound on Wall Street from losses in the previous day helped shares come off lows.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index ended down 0.2 percent, having fallen as much as 1 percent earlier in the session. The index remains down 5.7 percent from the two-and-a-half year peak hit at the end of January.
""Stock markets are weaker today after the Federal Reserve released the minutes of their latest meeting last night,"" said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.
 Barclays  (L:BARC) was the best performing stock among blue-chips, rising 4.4 percent after it pledged to restore its full dividend with a payout of 6.5 pence per share in 2018.
The earnings further buoyed optimism on British banks, a day after Lloyds (LON:LLOY) reported its highest pretax profit since 2006.
Other financial companies had positive news, with French insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) posting higher than expected 2017 net profit and Belgian financial services provider KBC (BR:KBC) boosted by solid performances in the Czech Republic and its international business. 
Their shares rose 0.6 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. 
Denmark's  Genmab  (CO:GEN), Europe's biggest biotechnology company, posted the best performance within the STOXX 600, surging as much as 19 percent as it reassured investors on sales growth of blood cancer drug Darzalex this year.
Denmark-based hearing aid manufacturer  William Demant  Holding (CO:WDH) was second with a 6.9 percent jump after results came in above forecast.
In the currently unpopular utilities sectors, France's Veolia (PA:VIE) jumped 2.1 percent after reporting an acceleration of growth in early 2018. Double-digit international growth and a recovery in France boosted 2017 core earnings. 
UK energy supplier  Centrica  (L:CNA), which issued a profit warning in November, rose 7.5 percent after it raised its cost saving target by 500 million pounds and said it would cut about 4,000 jobs by 2020. 
In another unloved sector, Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) lost 2.4 percent after its results, and  Telefonica  Deutschland (DE:O2Dn) fell 2.6 percent after RBC cut its target price by 13 percent. Telefonica (MC:TEF) rose 3.8 percent after a well-received earnings update.
French payment technology company  Ingenico  (PA:INGC) suffered its worst trading day in 16 years, down as much as 20 percent in the early morning, after announcing 2018 guidance below analyst expectations.
In contrast to the positive share price reaction to Glencore's (L:GLEN) upbeat results on Wednesday,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL)  fell 0.6 percent after presenting 2007 results that missed some forecasts.

Moneysupermarket.com (L:MONY) fell 13.7 percent after the price comparison website said its earnings would not grow this year as it tries to reinvent itself to focus on more personalization, mobile and new products such as mortgages.

1527,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 12:10PM ET</span>",Harvard students learn from McKinsey scandal in South Africa,"By Joe Brock
LONDON (Reuters) - An ill-fated deal struck by global consultancy McKinsey in South Africa has been used by Harvard Business School as a case study for students.
McKinsey had a local management consultancy, Trillian, as a partner when working on a big contract to advise South African state utility Eskom. The deal collapsed because of corruption allegations that have damaged McKinsey's reputation.
Trillian was controlled at the time by friends of Jacob Zuma, who was then South Africa's president. McKinsey denies it knowingly let funds from Eskom be diverted to a firm controlled by Zuma allies as a way to secure the contract.
The case study, seen by Reuters and dated Jan. 7, 2018, asks students at the elite business school in the U.S. city of Boston to imagine they are a McKinsey employee deciding whether to partner with Trillian to win a contract with Eskom.
It explains that McKinsey could have a better chance of winning the contract if Trillian is given a percentage of the deal.
""Would you bring in Trillian for the proposal to Eskom? How would you come to your decision? What additional information would you request?"" the case study asks. 
One scribbled note on the paper says ""blow the whistle"". It is not clear whether a student or a staff member wrote this. 
A spokesman for McKinsey declined comment on the case study.
Jim Aisner, a spokesman for Harvard Business School, said it was part of a course called: ""Africa Rising: Understanding Business, Entrepreneurship, and the Complexities of a Continent.""
""The primary goal of this exercise was to place students in the protagonist role so that they could understand the complicated issues facing senior management in South Africa,"" Aisner said in an emailed response to questions.
The scenario highlights the attention the case has attracted in the United States, where McKinsey is based.
McKinsey, the world's largest management consultancy, said last year it was ""embarrassed"" by errors it made in working at Eskom alongside Trillian, but denied it did anything illegal and said it would pay back its fee.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 01:07PM ET</span>",BMW settles U.S. claims it refused lease refunds to military personnel,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - BMW AG agreed to pay more than $2.2 million to settle U.S. government claims that it failed to provide required refunds to 492 military personnel who lawfully terminated their vehicle leases because they were called to duty.
In the first case of its kind, the U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday said BMW Financial Services NA violated the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act by having since August 2011 refused to reimburse so-called capitalized cost reductions to service members who ended their leases early.
BMW's payout includes $2.17 million to compensate the 492 service members, plus $60,788 to the U.S. Treasury. The German automaker did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
Capitalized cost reductions are upfront payments made to reduce monthly lease payments, and typically amount to thousands of dollars.
In papers filed with the federal court in Newark, New Jersey, the government said BMW violated the law by refusing as a matter of policy to refund such payments to service members who were called to duty for 180 days, or permanently assigned to new locations.
It cited as illustrations BMW's failure to give refunds to two Air Force sergeants stationed at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, who each terminated a lease for a 2015 BMW 328i because they were respectively deployed for six months to Afghanistan and relocated for three years to Japan.
""Men and women who serve in the armed forces have made enormous sacrifices while selflessly protecting our nation from danger,"" U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito in New Jersey said in a statement. ""We must honor their sacrifice by ensuring that their rights are protected when duty calls for their relocation or deployment overseas."" 
BMW had contended that the upfront payments were a form of down payment retained by dealers, and not subject to refunds.
In a statement, it said the settlement establishes a ""clear process"" for refunds, and will ""result in a better understanding of this unusual legal issue.""

BMW Financial Services is based in Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey. The automaker's brands also include Mini and Rolls-Royce (LON:RR).

1534,By Investing.com,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 11:21AM ET</span>",Bank Stocks Look Set To Prosper,"Investing.com - Bank stocks have emerged as one of the favorite sectors on Wall Street. Higher interest rates may be seen as a threat in some quarters of the market but rising rates are good for the banking industry. As rates go higher, so do bank profits. The banking sector has been one of the best performing since the presidential election of 2016, and some analysts expect the sector to outperform the broader market again in 2018. Banks have more than higher interest rates going for them. Analysts say the strong economy will increase loan demand and attract more deposits. Banks will also benefit from lower taxes, a more favorable regulatory environment and the use of new technology, such as blockchain. Banks even benefit when the financial markets are volatile because trading revenue increases. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) are two of the most common top picks of analysts.  Investors can also invest via popular exchange traded funds, such as the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking (MX:KRE) ETF.

By Noor Zainab Hussain and Esha Vaish
(Reuters) - The sovereign wealth fund of Norway bought a 245 million pounds ($342 million) stake in British property group Shaftesbury from Invesco, regulatory filings showed on Thursday.
Shaftesbury owns and manages retail, office and residential properties in the prime London districts of Soho and Covent Garden.
Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the world's largest sovereign wealth fund and one of the largest holders of London property, increased its stake in Shaftesbury to 20.86 percent from 12.66 percent earlier.
Norges, Shaftesbury's second biggest shareholder, also owns a 25 percent share in London's Regent Street, with the rest held by the Crown Estate, a collection of lands and holdings in the United Kingdom belonging to the Queen. 
It bought the stake in Shaftesbury from Invesco, an investment management firm, which sold most of its holding of 9.99 percent.
The stake changed hands at a price of 970 pence according to the filing, giving a total price of 245 million pounds.
Shaftesbury's top investor is Hong Kong billionaire Samuel Tak Lee, with a 25 percent stake.
The stake sale comes two weeks after the company's annual general meeting where Lee voted down two resolutions to authorize directors to allot shares.
Newspapers have speculated that Lee could make a bid for the property company, as he has taken advantage of the weakness in sterling to build up his stake in the company in the past few months. 
Lee owns swathes of prime retail and office space in London's West End through the company Langham Estate.
Shaftesbury declined to comment.
The company has a market valuation of 2.99 billion pounds ($4.16 billion).

1539,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",EU presidency seeks to ease new rules on foreign banks,"By Huw Jones and Francesco Guarascio
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has been urged by its presidency to ease proposed new regulations on foreign banks within the block to bring them in line with U.S. requirements, EU documents showed on Thursday.
The draft law proposing a so-called intermediate parent undertaking (IPU), whereby foreign banks would have to bring their EU operations under a single holding company, is widely seen as a tit-for-tat response to rules issued by the U.S. Federal Reserve requiring large foreign banks in the United States to form holding companies.
The EU proposal could also apply to large British banks after the country leaves the European Union.
The aim of the draft EU rules is to make it easier for the bloc's regulators to deal with a crisis at a foreign bank. It would also increase regulatory checks on foreign lenders and in many cases raise their costs.
In a document seen by Reuters, EU presidency Bulgaria has proposed changes to the draft rules put forward by the European Commission in 2016, saying the IPU requirement should kick in when a foreign bank has total assets of at least 40 billion euros ($49.20 billion) in the EU.
The initial proposal established a 30 billion euro threshold and the automatic inclusion of globally systemic banks, which would force 19 large foreign lenders to adapt to the stricter rules.
The change would bring the EU in line with the $50 billion threshold enforced under U.S. rules on foreign banks.
The EU presidency amendment could also result in a significant reduction in the number of banks covered and help Europe to look more attractive at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has cut corporate taxes for banks and other businesses. 
There are 30 global banks, such as HSBC (L:HSBA), Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) and  Barclays  (L:BARC), that have been deemed by international regulators and central banks to be globally systemic and must comply with tougher capital requirements.
Under the original EU proposal, foreign banks on the global list of systemic lenders would be required automatically to set up an IPU irrespective of how many assets they have there.
The document shows that the EU presidency wants to end this automatic inclusion, moving in line with U.S. rules, which do not discriminate between systemic and non-systemic lenders.
The presidency document also proposes that a future review of the new rules should take into account changes made to the U.S. regulations, given that the U.S. Treasury may narrow the scope of its rules. Japan and China have also said they may introduce similar measures, the document said.
The EU rules are due to take effect in 2019 or later.

The succession issue does not seem pressing. Chairman Axel Weber let it be known last year that he planned to stay on until 2022, with Ermotti as his CEO.
Bilanz magazine said Ermotti had agreed to give Weber a year's notice before leaving the job he has held since 2011, and that it was clear UBS would seek an internal candidate to lead the world's biggest private bank.
""Something probably would not have gone well if my successor came from outside,"" Ermotti said.
UBS co-heads of wealth management Martin Blessing and Tom Naratil, investment banking head Andrea Orcel, chief operating office Sabine Keller-Busse and Swiss domestic head Axel Lehmann have been named by media as possible successors for Ermotti.
Ermotti was coy about whether he would like to be UBS chairman one day.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 01:07PM ET</span>",President of Tezos Swiss foundation steps down,"By Anna Irrera
(Reuters) - The president of a Swiss foundation that conducted a $232 million online fundraiser for the embattled Tezos cryptocurrency project has stepped down, the foundation said in a statement on Thursday. 
Johann Gevers, who helped set up the foundation in July, has been replaced by Ryan Jesperson, one of the project's contributors, the foundation said. Another board member, Diego Olivier Fernandez Pons, has also stepped down, while Michel Mauny, a French computer programming academic has joined the board, the Zug-based foundation said. 
The Tezos foundation raised funds to develop a new cryptocurrency in July, through a so-called initial coin offering. While the Tezos ICO remains one of the largest by amount raised, contributors have yet to receive the new cryptocurrency because the project was derailed by infighting between the project's founders, Kathleen and Arthur Breitman and Gevers. The feud between the Breitmans and Gevers was reported by Reuters in October.
The Breitmans control the Tezos technology through their Delaware-based company, while the foundation controls the funds raised. The Breitmans said in a written statement they welcomed the new board members and they remain ""fully dedicated to the Tezos project.""
Gevers and Pons ""voluntarily"" stepped down from the board, according to the statement. Gevers declined to comment on whether he had reached a financial settlement, citing ongoing litigation.
The new board is ""preparing itself to assist in the timely launch of the Tezos network,"" according to the statement. A spokesman for the foundation did not provide more information on the timing for the launch and the issuance of the cryptocurrency to contributors. 
Since the feud was reported, several class-action lawsuits have been filed in the U.S. against the project's organizers alleging the fundraiser violated federal securities laws and defrauded investors.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission denied a public information request from David Silver, a lawyer representing some of the class-action plaintiffs, seeking information on Tezos, saying doing so could interfere with an investigation or enforcement activities.
The Tezos fundraiser was structured as a donation, though some contributors believed it was an investment. If deemed a donation and not a security, the funds raised might not fall under the remit of the SEC.
Silver said in an email he looked forward to learning more about the new president of the board and his business background. ""Unfortunately, the governance situation is a complicated mess; and I don't think this does anything to help that,"" Silver said.

Jesperson, an American who works in financial technology, is planning to relocate to Zug from Utah with his family, according to the foundation's statement. Earlier this year, Jesperson led an effort to set up a second Swiss foundation for the Tezos project with the aim of supporting the cryptocurrency release in case the infighting continued.

""You're starting to see that turn into being a bit of a sellers' market on the used side, for good aircraft anyway,"" CFO John Di Bert told the  Barclays  (LON:BARC) industrial conference in Miami. ""That absorbs a lot of demand that was out there.""
The supply of pre-owned aircraft, which ballooned after the 2008 financial crash, has limited demand for new jets in recent years, with deliveries of new planes seen staying flat until 2019, forecasters said in October.
But business jet makers are seeing even fewer choices of pre-owned aircraft available to buyers which they expect will boost demand for new corporate aircraft.
In 2017, business jet deliveries grew by 1.3 percent, rising from 667 to 676 units, according to figures released this week from the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA).
Canadian plane-and-train-maker Bombardier, one of the world's largest makers of business jets, previously had $500 million in used aircraft inventory, which it takes as trade-ins from customers. 
The company is now ""fully sold out,"" Di Bert said.
A spokeswoman for Gulfstream Aerospace, a Bombardier rival and a division of General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), was not immediately available to comment. 
Bombardier Chief Executive Alain Bellemare also told the conference he expects rising interest from the United States, Russia, China and the Middle East to boost demand for top-end business jets above the current market of about ""60-ish"" jets a year. 
Bombardier's ultra-long-range Global 7000 is expected to enter service later this year, challenging the Gulfstream 650, which is currently alone at the high end of the market.

Bellemare said the company would wait for the Global 7000 to enter service before deciding whether to go ahead with its sister business jet, the Global 8000.

PARIS (Reuters) - French supermarket chain Intermarche could be fined after competition investigators found it breached rules with its hefty discounts on products such as the Nutella chocolate spread offer that caused pandemonium in some stores last month.
The French government's DGCCRF competition and anti-fraud agency found that Intermarche broke a French law forbidding retailers from selling products below their actual cost, junior economy minister Delphine Geny-Stephann said on Thursday.
Intermarche's discounting in this case risked a potential fine, Geny-Stephann told RTL radio. 
Under French law, a judge will now consider the case and decide whether to impose a fine, which can be up to 375,000 euros ($461,000) for selling at a loss.
Intermarche had no immediate comment on Thursday.
French retailers are only allowed to sell below cost during annual sale periods on products they have had in stock for at least 30 days.
In an interview with newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche this month, Intermarche Chairman Thierry Cotillard said that the price offer was made during its official winter sales period.
The promotions at the end of January offered 70 percent reductions on some grocery brands and led to scuffles among shoppers trying to grab jars of Nutella.
Nutella, made by Italian group Ferrero, is a household favorite in France and footage of the unrest in the Intermarche stores went viral on French social media.
The promotions also covered Procter & Gamble's (N:PG) nappy brand Pampers, Nestle's (S:NESN) Perrier sparkling water and Lavazza's Carte Noire coffee, the DGCCRF said.
The promotional offer was annoying to the French government as ministers were preparing to unveil draft legislation aimed at ensuring fairer prices for farmers, notably by curbing aggressive discounting by supermarkets.
The planned food law has been advocated by President Emmanuel Macron as a key response to the long-standing difficulties of many French farmers.

Macron hosted hundreds of young farmers at a reception at the Elysee presidential palace on Thursday, ahead of the annual Paris farm show -- traditionally a politically important event in France -- a day after farmers staged protests against trade concessions to South American countries.

(Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Thursday named company insider Kumar Galhotra as head of its North American operations, filling the gap left by the abrupt departure of Raj Nair after an internal investigation uncovered ""inappropriate behavior"" by the executive.
The appointment was part of a broader executive reshuffle by the No. 2 U.S. automaker, the second such move in less than a year since Jim Hackett took the chief executive job in May.
Galhotra, who has worked for Ford for 29 years and previously led its luxury Lincoln Motor Co arm, will report to Jim Farley, Ford's president of global markets.
The appointment is effective March 1.
Ford said on Wednesday that Nair was leaving the company immediately after an investigation found his behavior was ""inconsistent with the company's code of conduct.""
It did not give any details on what that behavior entailed. A company spokesman said the review was launched in the past few weeks after Ford received a report of inappropriate behavior.
Ford said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that under the terms of his separation agreement, Nair is entitled to retirement and healthcare benefits but will not receive a bonus for 2017 or 2018 and some equity-based awards will be canceled. 
Nair has agreed to waive claims against Ford and to cooperate with any future investigations or litigation.
Galhotra, who has also served as Ford's chief marketing officer since last year, takes charge of a business that generates about 90 percent of Ford's global profits.
The company also made a handful of other changes to its senior management team on Thursday, appointing Joy Falotico to replace Galhotra as group vice president for Lincoln and chief marketing officer.
David McClelland was made vice president of Ford and CEO of Ford Motor Credit Co, Stuart Rowley was named vice president and chief operating officer for Ford North America and John Lawler was appointed vice president, strategy of Ford.
Cathy O’Callaghan was named vice president and corporate controller, and chief financial officer, global markets.

In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ford shares were up 3 cents at $10.63.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 10:00AM ET</span>",German court delays ruling on diesel ban to next week,"By Markus Wacket
LEIPZIG, Germany (Reuters) - A German court on Thursday delayed a ruling on whether major cities can ban heavily polluting diesel cars, which could hit the resale value of 15 million vehicles in Europe's largest car market and force automakers to pay for costly modifications.
Judge Andreas Korbmacher said the country's highest federal administrative court would rule on Feb. 27 on an appeal brought by German states against bans imposed by local courts in Stuttgart and Duesseldorf over poor air quality.
There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests, meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx), known to cause respiratory disease.
While other countries are also considering restrictions on diesel cars, bans in the birthplace of the modern automobile would be a new blow for the car industry, and an embarrassment for Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, which has backed it.
""Diesel might get its final kiss of death (from the court ruling),"" Evercore ISI analysts wrote in a note to clients.
Germany has long promoted diesel to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and meet climate change goals, but the Volkswagen (VW) scandal has pushed its carmakers to step up spending on electric cars, as well as investments into making diesel engines cleaner.
The federal administrative court in Leipzig is due to rule on whether bans imposed by local courts are legal after environmental group DUH sued city authorities. The DUH is also pursuing bans in many other German cities.
During proceedings in Leipzig on Thursday, lawyers discussed whether the government would have to introduce a new way of labeling cars to enable authorities to enforce any bans.
Judge Korbmacher suggested the European Court of Justice might have to consider the issue of whether bans are permissible.
Merkel's government, which has come under fire for its close ties to the car industry, has lobbied against bans, fearing they could anger millions of drivers and disrupt traffic in cities, with public transport not in a position to take up the slack.
Meanwhile, authorities in Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centers by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban new diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year.
BAD AIR
A small group of protesters from Greenpeace gathered outside the Leipzig court, with images of lungs painted on their chests and holding up signs reading ""Clean Air Now"".
""Because the government has failed to do anything for years about exhaust problems in the cities, judges have to decide today how residents will be protected from bad air,"" said Greenpeace transport spokesman Benjamin Stephan.
The threat of bans has prompted a big fall in sales of diesel cars in Germany, down to just a third of new car sales in January from almost half before the VW scandal.
In an attempt to avert bans, Merkel's government agreed a deal with carmakers last year to overhaul engine management software on 5.3 million diesel cars as well as funding for cities to help cut emissions by taxis and buses.
Environmental groups have called software updates insufficient and have lobbied for cars applying the latest Euro-6 and older Euro-5 emissions standards to have their exhaust treatment systems upgraded.
Evercore ISI has said it could cost up to 14.5 billion euros ($17.8 billion) to retrofit Germany's Euro-5 diesel fleet, and as much as double that if the entire diesel fleet is affected.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 11:16AM ET</span>",UPS partners with Workhorse to build electric delivery vans,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) -  United Parcel  Service Inc (N:UPS) said on Thursday it is partnering with truck maker Workhorse Group Inc (O:WKHS) to build electric delivery vans that could replace tens of thousands of vehicles in the package delivery company's fleet.
The two companies said the first 50 vans will have a range of 100 miles (160 km) and will be delivered in 2018. 
Atlanta-based UPS said it has approximately 35,000 diesel or gasoline trucks currently in service in urban and suburban areas that are comparable in size and run on routes comparable to the new vehicle's range.
""We see this vehicle as being a game changer in the electric truck arena,"" Carlton Rose, UPS' president for global fleet maintenance and engineering told Reuters. ""It's also an industry first because the acquisition cost is comparable to gas and diesel."" 
The Workhorse delivery vehicles will cost about the same as conventional trucks, but have a lower cost of ownership because they are cheaper to run on a per-mile basis. 
Vehicle manufacturers such as  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and  Navistar International Corp  (N:NAV), plus a host of new entrants, are racing to overcome the challenges of substituting batteries for diesel engines in delivery vehicles as regulators crack down on carbon dioxide and soot pollution.
Daimler said last fall UPS will be the first U.S. commercial customer for its new battery-powered eCanter truck, and the automaker will expand production as cheaper, longer-range batteries become available within two to three years.
And U.S. truck leasing and rental company  Ryder System Inc  (N:R) said in November it would order 125 all-electric delivery vans from Chanje, whose main investor is FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd (HK:0729).
Loveland, Ohio-based Workhorse has already sold around 300 delivery vehicles to UPS and has been testing package deliveries with drones for the company.
UPS' Rose said the vans would be lightweight, which will help boost their range and will have fast-charging capability. 
Workhorse is already testing its lightweight N-Gen model, which has a carbon composite frame, in California and Ohio for an unnamed customer.
That vehicle weighs 5,500 lbs (2,495 kg) when empty - 5,000 lbs lighter than comparable vehicles.

Cutting high costs associated with last-mile delivery as ecommerce has grown is a major priority for Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which runs its own delivery service in some cities and has leased cargo planes to reduce expenses.

TORONTO (Reuters) -  Newmont Mining  Corp (N:NEM) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday and maintained a production prediction that would see it take the title of world's largest bullion producer from rival Barrick Gold (TO:ABX).
Newmont, which has mines in the Americas, Africa and Australia, said fourth-quarter gold output nudged 1.4 percent higher to 1.34 million ounces, matching Barrick's performance, as prices rose 6.5 percent to $1,270 per ounce. 
In the next two years, Colorado-based Newmont sees annual output between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces of gold, then between 4.6 million and 5.1 million ounces annually through 2022.
In contrast, Toronto-based Barrick cut its 2018 forecast to between 4.5 million and 5 million ounces of gold, while targeting 4.2 million to 4.6 million ounces of annual production from 2019 to 2022. 
Newmont said low-cost production from newer mines, coupled with productivity gains, helped drive an 88 percent gain in full-year free cash flow to $1.48 billion.
""This performance gave us the means to invest in five new projects, raise our dividend by 87 percent, and increase our investment in exploration – an investment that paid off as we added 6.4 million ounces of gold to our reserve base, offsetting depletion for the first time in five years,"" said Chief Executive Gary Goldberg in a statement.
Newmont, which ended the quarter with $3.3 billion cash on hand, reported adjusted profit of 40 cents per share, above analysts' average forecast of 38 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The all-in sustaining costs to produce an ounce of gold — a key industry benchmark — rose 5.4 percent to $968.
The miner lifted its 2018 capital budget to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion from a December forecast of $900 million to $1 billion, citing a range of projects.
Earlier this week, Newmont revised its dividend policy with a quarterly payout of 14 cents per share, replacing its previous gold-price linked plan.
On Wednesday, the company reported gold reserves of 68.5 million ounces for 2017, unchanged from 2016, as it replaced reserves through exploration, projects, revisions and acquisitions. Gold resources were up 1 percent, to 48.2 million ounces.

The company also said it plans to spend approximately $230 million on exploration in 2018, earmarking some 39 percent for North America, 20 percent for Australia and the remainder for South America, Africa and other locations.

1570,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 08:01AM ET</span>",Bond Market Guide to Trading When 10-Year Treasuries Hit 3%,"(Bloomberg) -- At this point, it’s more likely a matter of when -- not if -- the 10-year Treasury yield hits 3 percent. And that apparent inevitability raises a pressing question: How to trade when it happens?
The 10-year yield was last above 3 percent in January 2014 and since the start of last year bond gurus like Jeffrey Gundlach at DoubleLine Capital and Scott Minerd at Guggenheim Partners have highlighted the level as critical to determining whether the three-decade bull market in bonds is at an end. It’s also seen as the point at which equity markets might crack and the dollar could halt its slump against other major currencies.
The yield reached as high as 2.9537 percent on Wednesday after minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s January meeting helped spur a selloff, and it was at 2.93 percent as of 7:45 a.m. Thursday in New York.
Here’s what to watch for when the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield reaches the much vaunted 3 percent level:
Breakout or Pullback?
The most immediate question for traders: Do 10-year yields hit 3 percent and retreat, or does positioning signal a sharp move higher? Anticipating the volatility and its implications could make a big difference.
“Certainly as we get closer to 3 percent, people will get nervous,” said Michael Cloherty, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “I would expect flows to pick up as we’re closer and closer to 3 and to see some choppiness in the market.”
Volatility may not be as bad as some investors fear. So-called “short gamma” strategies, which effectively bet that the market will stay quiet, have been steadily hedging those wagers, according to a New York trader who isn’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. That means an accelerated break through 3 percent may not happen.
In fact, open interest on 10-year Treasury futures suggests 3 percent may not be the crucial level after all. There are a large number of March puts at a 120 strike price, equivalent to a 2.95 percent yield. That helps explain the resistance to moving much higher than that so far this year.
Another large accumulation of puts comes at a 118 strike price in April, equivalent to a 3.1 percent yield on the 10-year security. Dealers who are on the other side of those options could hedge during a selloff by purchasing 10-year Treasury futures, thus creating inherent support.
In other words, those bond bears ready to watch the Treasury market falter at 3 percent may be in for a slow grind.
Testing Technicals
To be precise, traders will be watching for the 10-year yield to break through 3.0516 percent, the intraday high from Jan. 2, 2014. You have to go back to July 2011 to find the last time the yield exceeded that level.
Technical analysis has its naysayers, but it’s been a harbinger of things to come since Donald Trump’s win in the 2016 presidential election. For all of 2017, the key 2.64 percent level on 10-year yields couldn’t be broken. Strategists warned that a breach left little stopping an ascent to 3 percent.
Sure enough, yields soared past 2.64 percent in January and now they’re knocking on the door of 3 percent.
The next stop (once 3 percent is convincingly in the rear-view mirror) is less clear. Beyond 3.05 percent, the next area of yield resistance would be around 3.14 percent or 3.15 percent, which relates to levels from late 2010 and early 2011, said Marty Mitchell, a former head government-bond trader at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. and now an independent strategist. Further out, he points to 3.215 percent to 3.25 percent.
In the distance, a big key level would be near the highs for 2011, Mitchell said. The yield reached as much as 3.77 percent in February of that year. Of course, that’s a ways away and, as the positioning data shows, it’ll be a struggle to take out each successive key level.
“I think we test 3.05, then we see a more sustained correction downside in yields,” Mitchell said. “But I believe we’re in an uptrend in yields, so any strength in the bond market needs to be sold.”
Watching Stocks
Treasuries, of course, don’t exist in a vacuum. It’s easy to forget amid 2018’s rout that the 10-year yield plunged almost 14 basis points on Feb. 5, capitalizing on haven demand as equities suffered steep losses. When stocks stabilized, yields marched higher again.
Some strategists say a 3 percent 10-year yield represents the end of the stock market rally, with corporate borrowing costs becoming too punitive and fixed-income looking too appealing. Others, like Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG, say 3.5 percent is the level to watch.
Regardless of the exact level, bond traders may find that the best barometer of which way yields are headed after 3 percent will come from stocks. A bout of selling in equities probably means the “tug-of-war” between the two asset classes is alive and well, serving as a cap on yields and perhaps preventing too much tightening from the Federal Reserve. If stocks shrug at 3 percent, then it’s a green light for the selloff to carry on. 
Hedge funds and other large speculators have a lot riding on the outcome. The group has boosted short bets in 10-year Treasury futures to a record, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data through Feb. 13. That positioning could exacerbate the market moves in either direction.
Long-Run Divergence
Lost in the question of “what’s next” is that 3 percent marks the highest yield on a 10-year Treasury note in more than four years. That’s a compelling proposition, particularly for hold-until-maturity investors, who are relatively insensitive to price swings.
It’s tempting to wait for an even better entry point. But more than half of the 59 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg this month say the 10-year yield will end 2018 at or below 3 percent. After all, the Fed’s own projections call for its target rate to climb just above 3 percent in 2020, before settling at a longer-term rate of 2.75 percent.
“If you think that 3 percent is where the Fed is going to stay, you’ll see a significant level of demand at those levels,” said Bruno Braizinha, a rates and cross-asset strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) SA.
His fellow strategists at Wall Street banks are finally seeing signs that the overwhelmingly bearish momentum is starting to fade.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., for instance, is looking to go long if yields keep climbing.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc isn’t waiting for 3 percent, instead recommending buying at 2.9 percent.
Then there are those in the middle, like Cloherty at RBC. A 3 percent 10-year yield could serve as a good short-term trade, he said, because Japanese investors are likely to step in and buy after their fiscal year ends on March 31. But it’s probably headed higher toward the end of 2018.
“The pattern will be a sideways slide for the second quarter and then we leak higher in the second half on Fed tightening and an awful lot of Treasury supply,” Cloherty said. “We see people trying to protect themselves more against higher rates, but I don’t think that just because we break 3 we’re destined to go to 3.5.”

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 12:34PM ET</span>",Toys are not us: Target investors,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) -  Target  Corp (N:TGT) should hold off on plans to cash in on a perceived advantage in toys after the collapse of Toys ""R"" Us, several of the company's investors told Reuters, worried it could eat up capital desperately needed in an Amazon-dominated retail world. 
When the biggest toy retailer in the U.S. went bankrupt last September, analysts parsing through the wreckage came to the conclusion that Target would be among the biggest beneficiaries. 
Of the 182 Toys ""R"" Us stores scheduled to close in the first half of 2018, 93 percent are within a 15-minute drive of at least one Target store and analysts say the department-store chain should see more traffic as a result.
The Minneapolis-based company was already in the middle of a push that saw it add 1,400 new toys to its catalog in 2017 and Wall Street brokerages say it could see a 30-45 basis point jump in overall group sales as a consequence of the bankruptcy.
""We are playing to win in toys. We think there is opportunity to expand share,"" Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said on a conference call last November.
Target has also launched a number of exclusive toys including a board game based on Bob Ross's Joy of Painting TV show and introduced a line of action figures based on characters from Netflix's (O:NFLX) smash hit ""Stranger Things"". 
The investors who spoke to Reuters in the past month were not convinced. 
""We do not believe Target should invest more in selling national brand toys, and Target's toys business is not core to our investment thesis,"" said Jack Leslie, a portfolio manager for Miller/Howard Investments Portfolio, who holds a $96 million stake in Target.
HEAD ON FIGHT
Target declined to say how much it is spending on toy advertising and repositioning itself, but the company did lay out plans last year to spend $2 billion on promotions, stores and technology to fight other retailers head on. 
Analysts from UBS estimate the company could get a 0.4-0.45 percent boost in revenue even if it only managed to capture 25 percent of the sales lost by Toys ""R"" Us. 
Target's stock, down over 10 percent in 2017, has recovered those losses to trade up 11.7 percent this year.
Yet the picture is cloudy and complicated by the Toys ""R"" Us restructuring and the underlying factors behind its bankruptcy. 
The toy chain collapsed mainly by its inability to service a huge debt load piled on it by its private equity buyers, KKR & Co LP (N:KKR) and Bain Capital LP, amid tepid sales and a broader shift toward online shopping. 
Sector analysts are unsure how long it will take Toys ""R"" Us to emerge from bankruptcy. 
If Target wants to get, and as importantly, keep the customers Toys ""R"" Us lost, then it will need to invest solidly in marketing itself as a major toy retailer.
At the same time there is the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) factor that continues to upend the traditional retailing industry everyday. 
""The toy category is not a growth category,"" said Steven Roorda, an analyst and portfolio manager with Minnesota-based Stonebridge Capital Advisors, who has covered Target for 30 years and owns shares of the company.
""U.S. birth rates are moderating and along with children using other devices to access entertainment at an earlier age (that) means that the toy category has been under pressure as evidenced by what is going on with (toymaker) Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT).""
Four of the institutional investors who Reuters spoke to said they would rather see Target focus on exclusive private-label brands, expanding its online business and open more stores next to urban campuses to make it ""un-Amazonable"". 
""Is Target going to improve its business, improve its traffic and will there be a halo effect from selling more toys. I think the answer is yes, yes and yes,"" said John Tompkins, a portfolio manager at Tyvor Capital, which owns more than 300,000 shares in the retailer. 

""Would I raise my stake specifically related to this because I think their toy business is going to get better, no.""

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 08:01AM ET</span>",Jump in Islamic tax liabilities worries Saudi banks,"By Marwa Rashad, Tom Arnold and Saeed Azhar
RIYADH/DUBAI (Reuters) - A jump in retroactive Islamic tax liabilities faced by Saudi Arabian banks is creating concern about damage to their earnings and the government's motives in demanding the money.
While Saudi banks and other firms generally do not pay corporate tax, they are subject to an annual Islamic tax called zakat, a 2.5 percent levy on each bank's net worth. Analysts say the way in which this is assessed can be complex and opaque.
In the last couple of weeks, several major banks have disclosed that the government's General Authority of Zakat and Tax (GAZT) is seeking additional zakat payments from them for years going back as far as 2002. In some cases, the demands exceed half of a bank's annual net profit.
The banks are challenging the assessments, but analysts said the issue could weigh on share prices in the banking sector, which is expected to attract billions of dollars of foreign investment as Saudi Arabia joins global equity indexes in the next couple of years.
So far, only a few of Saudi Arabia's 12 listed banks have disclosed retroactive zakat demands, but analysts predicted more would do so as they released full financial statements for 2017 in the coming weeks.
""The additional zakat demanded by GAZT is likely to impact all banks,"" said Shabbir Malik, regional financials analyst at investment bank EFG Hermes. ""Our understanding is that the final verdict on the zakat issue will be known later this year and we will then have a better idea of the scale of the impact.""
GAZT did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. Analysts said it appeared the new demands stemmed from certain long-term investments, which were previously exempt from zakat, now being deemed liable for the tax.
Some bankers said privately they worried the demands might essentially be a money grab by the government, which wants to raise new revenues to cover a big budget deficit caused by low oil prices.
Last month, Riyadh said it had secured $106 billion in financial settlements with detainees in a sweeping crackdown on corruption - a huge windfall for the state. The zakat demands may aim to ensure the banking industry contributes more to national development.
""They changed arbitrarily how they assess the tax base,"" said an investment banker at a local bank. ""It's just a way for the government to get more money.""
AL RAJHI
Among banks affected by the demands, Al Rajhi Bank (SE:1120) said in its 2017 financial statement that GAZT had issued ""assessment orders"" for 2002-9 amounting to 723 million riyals ($193 million). That is nearly 8 percent of its 2017 net profit.
It said some factors which previously limited its zakat bill had now been disallowed. ""These additional demands arose mainly due to disallowance of long-term investments, statutory deposit and financing lease for the purpose of computation of (the) zakat base, which has consequently increased the zakat exposure,"" the bank said.
Al Rajhi said it was appealing the demands, but that GAZT had not yet issued an assessment for 2010-16, which could involve significant further exposure.
 Alinma  Bank (SE:1150) said its additional zakat exposure for 2009-15 was 1.66 billion riyals, or about 82 percent of its profit in 2017. The bank has filed an appeal for 2009-11.
Riyad Bank's (SE:1010) additional liabilities for 2008-2013 have been assessed at 3.54 billion riyals, the bank said, around 89 percent of 2017 profit. It said it was contesting the assessment at various levels.
The biggest listed Saudi bank, National Commercial Bank (SE:1180), which is majority-owned by the government, did not mention increased zakat exposure in its 2017 statement.
The Saudi investment banker said the sums involved were not enough to threaten the stability of the banks, and that liabilities might be reduced in discussions with authorities.
""My understanding is that there will be back and forth discussions with the government and the banks, and the tax bill will eventually be reduced.""
So far, the zakat demands have had only a minor impact on share prices. Riyad Bank's shares are down 0.9 percent since Feb. 8, compared with a 1.0 percent gain by the Saudi stock index (TASI); Al Rajhi is up 0.8 percent.
But analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a note to clients: ""These additional demands have a negative read-across for Saudi banks given the potential capital impact, and we expect these disclosures to weigh on share price performance.""

The Saudi banker said: ""You can't do this type of thing if you want to attract foreign investment -- these are the things that frustrate people.""

1573,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 04:36PM ET</span>","Dow, S&P climb on energy and industrials; Nasdaq falls","By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 advanced on Thursday to halt a two-session losing skid, buoyed by gains in industrial and energy shares as U.S. Treasury yields eased, while the Nasdaq lost ground for a third straight session. 
Major indexes advanced early as worries about a faster pace of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve were eased by comments by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who expressed concerns that a ""bunch of hikes"" could turn Fed policy restrictive. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields (US10YT=RR) retreated from the more than four-year highs hit on Wednesday.
Those gains faded, however, and major indexes finished well off session highs as investors exercised caution in what is likely to be a rising interest rate environment.
""The rally on Bullard was a little overzealous,"" said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. 
""I wouldn’t be out there aggressively buying stocks because until the interest rate picture clarifies, and it probably will do so at a higher level, it is just going to create problems for equities,"" he said.
The concerns over rising interest rates have dogged Wall Street of late, and stocks stumbled on Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Reserve's January meeting showed the central bank's rate-setting committee grew more confident in the need to keep raising rates.
Market participants are still largely expecting the Fed to raise rates three times this year, beginning with its next meeting in March.
Despite the recent climb in rates, many analysts expect the stock market to be able to absorb the rise as long as economic data remain supportive and the pace of the increase is modest. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 164.7 points, or 0.66 percent, to 24,962.48, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 2.63 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,703.96, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 8.14 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,210.09.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.9225 percent, from 2.941 percent late on Wednesday.
Industrial shares climbed 0.59 percent, led by a 3.04 percent gain in  Quanta Services  Inc (N:PWR) after its quarterly results and a 3.34 percent rise in United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) after the aero parts maker said it is exploring a breakup of its business portfolio.
Energy stocks (SPNY), up 1.08 percent, also helped support gains, as oil prices advanced on a surprise draw in U.S. crude inventories. 
Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK) shares surged 21.67 percent, their biggest daily percentage gain since April 2016, after the company's quarterly results and outlook.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 47 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.81 billion shares, compared to the 8.44 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

""It is not a factor,"" Robert Ansari, head of MSCI for the Middle East, told reporters at a financial conference in Abu Dhabi, when asked if the two issues were linked.
""If the Aramco IPO happens, where it lists, what and how it lists is independent of what MSCI will do to classify.""
The government plans to sell about 5 percent of the national oil firm in the second half of 2018, hoping to raise some $100 billion or more in what would likely be the world's biggest initial public offer. 
Authorities have said Aramco will be listed in Riyadh and possibly also in one or more foreign markets. The size of the IPO has raised concern among fund managers about the ability of the Saudi market, which has a capitalization of about $470 billion, to absorb it smoothly.

MSCI is expected to announce its decision in June on a potential upgrade of Saudi Arabia to emerging market status.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 07:41AM ET</span>",Buffett letter may tout optimism as broader market worries ebb,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett may use part of his annual letter to  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) shareholders, due on Saturday, to renew his optimism about America, at a time economic growth is on the upswing and U.S. stocks sit near record highs despite rising interest rates.
His enthusiasm is long-lived. In last year's letter, he touted the country's ""economic dynamism"" and ""miraculous"" achievements over its 240-year history. The year before, he called newborn American babies ""the luckiest crop in history."" And in 2015, he panned the ""preachers of pessimism"" who ""prattle endlessly about America's problems.""
What of 2018? ""Does Buffett have the guts to mention that we are in financial euphoria?"" said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle, a Berkshire investor.
The 87-year-old Buffett typically also uses his widely-read, humor-laced letters, which last year ran more than 14,000 words, to assess Berkshire's performance, praise some managers, and criticize excess on Wall Street and perhaps in Washington.
One area of focus may be the effort by Berkshire, Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to develop a healthcare company aimed at fighting skyrocketing costs that Buffett calls a ""hungry tapeworm"" on the economy. 
Berkshire will on Saturday also release year-end results expected to include a big jump in book value, a key gauge of growth at his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate.
Analysts have said much of any increase would reflect the new, lower corporate tax rate pushed by President Donald Trump, a Republican. Buffett typically supports Democratic causes.
CALL ME
The letter will give Buffett a chance to extol Gregory Abel and Ajit Jain, promoted in January to oversee Berkshire's more than 90 operating businesses including the BNSF railroad, Geico auto insurance and Dairy Queen ice cream.
This made them frontrunners to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive officer. Buffett may discuss how stiff competition and recent steep hurricane losses may affect pricing for insurance and reinsurance, which Jain oversees.
After Berkshire ended September with $109 billion of cash and equivalents, Buffett may renew his plea for companies with little debt, consistent earnings power and strong management, and which are looking for buyers, to call him.
Berkshire has gone more than two years since its last major purchase, Precision Castparts Corp.
Last year, it was outbid for Texas power transmission company Oncor, while its $15 billion commitment to help buyout partner 3G Capital buy  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) went nowhere because the European food company rebuffed the approach.
An inability to deploy cash may help explain why Buffett, who buys stocks when he cannot buy whole companies, built a $28 billion stake in Apple Inc (O:AAPL), surpassing the underperforming  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) as Berkshire's largest stock investment.

Berkshire recently owned 9.8 percent of the bank, and Buffett may want to discuss Wells Fargo's efforts to recover from recent scandals over how it treated customers.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Bank of Russia will need to inject extra capital into Otkritie Bank's business on top of the $8 billion already provided in a rescue package to the lender last year, said Otkritie's new Chief Executive Officer Mikhail Zadornov.
Russia's banking sector is in the spotlight after the central bank rescued three of the country's biggest private banks, including Otkritie, in the second half of 2017. The regulator has also shuttered dozens of smaller lenders as part of a banking sector clean-up drive.
Zadornov said in an interview with Reuters that Trust Bank, owned by Otkritie, and B&N Bank, which is merging with Otkritie, are expected to receive more bail-out money from the central bank's Banking Sector Consolidation Fund by the end of the first quarter.
Zadornov said that Otkritie's 2018 business plan, approved by its supervisory board, envisages a 70 percent increase in retail lending, both in cash and mortgages, and more loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises.

1597,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 06:31AM ET</span>",Inflation Is a Bigger Danger to Stocks Than Rates: Ben Carlson,"(Bloomberg View) -- Investors tend to attach narratives after events like the recent bout of market volatility as a way to provide comfort in the face of market uncertainty and losses.
Although there could be any number of causes for the downturn, recent data on an uptick in inflation and rising interest rates are two of the stories that have gained ground. Both can play a role in shaping market expectations, but one, inflation, has a stronger relationship with poor market outcomes.
It would make sense for investors to get spooked by each of these factors from a textbook perspective. Rising rates in fixed-income investments provide more competition for stocks from an asset-allocation standpoint and increase the cost of capital for corporations. Inflation could lead to an increase in wages and input costs, which has the potential to hurt corporate earnings if companies are unable to pass along their increased costs to customers.
But inflation and higher rates are two separate issues. Rising rates can be caused by rising inflation, but the two aren’t mutually exclusive. We can look at each on its own to see how it has affected stock market performance historically.
The 10-year Treasury yield is now up about 160 basis points since bottoming in July 2016. Using data from the Federal Reserve, I looked at each instance when rates rose 100 basis points or more since 1962 to see how stocks fared during rising rate environments. Although rates have been in a massive downtrend since the early 1980s, there have still been plenty of countertrend rallies in rates, along with the rising rate period in the 1960s and 1970s to test. Including the latest run-up in yields, there have been 17 such instances in this time.
The average performance of the S&P 500 during these past rising rate environments was almost 22 percent in total returns. Only three times did stocks fall when the 10-year rose by 1 percent or more, and the largest losses were just under 2 percent. So stocks have held up well in the face of rising interest rates over the past 50-plus years.
Yet the end of a rising rate environment coincided with a peak in the stock market that preceded a large decline in a few instances. Rates rose leading up to the 1987 market crash as well as the popping of the dot-com bubble in early 2000. There was also a bear market after the rise in rates in 1966 along with a 19 percent pullback in the summer of 1990.
While stocks have held up well during rising rate environments, the record shows returns are much lower from the impact of inflation. From 1928 to 2017, when inflation was below 3 percent in a given year, the S&P 500 showed a median return of close to 16 percent. But when inflation came in above 3 percent, the median return for stocks was just 6.5 percent a year.
A similar pattern emerges in periods of rising inflation data. In the years when inflation was lower than it was the previous year, the median return on the S&P 500 was 18.3 percent. Yet the median return on stocks was just 5.6 percent when inflation came in higher than it did the previous year.
So, it would make sense for investors to be more concerned about rising inflation than rising rates. Both could occur at the same time, but inflation appears to be more menacing to stocks when we look at these variables separately. Inflation is still running at just 2.1 percent based on the latest reading, so it’s still below average based on the past 90 years or so of data. Inflation is something investors should be on the lookout for in terms of underappreciated risks. What’s good for wages may not be a great thing for investors.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>",Booming fund financing poses risks for banks,"By Max Bower
LONDON (LPC) - Breakneck growth in the US$400bn fund financing market could pose a systemic risk to the banking sector as alternative investors borrow to boost returns, bankers and investors said.
Banks’ exposure is soaring as lenders compete to offer loans to funds, including private equity firms, direct lenders and CLOs, which add new leverage to already leveraged investments.
""The market's growth has been exponential,"" said Lee Doyle, global head of bank industry at Ashurst in London.
Concerns that the loans are being used to artificially boost returns have been raised by some Limited Partners (LPs), which traditionally supply funds’ capital, said Jennifer Choi, managing director of industry affairs at The Institutional Limited Partners Association (ILPA) in Washington, D.C.
“Is it now being misued? The systemic risk is more real than many think,” a senior lawyer said.
The use of bridging loans or subscription facilities is booming, particularly in the private equity industry.
These loans cover the gap between calling for investors' commitments and receiving funds. Loans based on the value of funds' portfolios are also available, but less widely used.
Banks have piled into fund financing in recent years, attracted by strong returns and the apparently low risk of lending to LPs, traditionally high net worth individuals, pension and insurance funds and sovereign wealth funds.
Some banks are committing as much as US$500m each to individual fund loans, the senior lawyer said.
“The problem is some banks view it as easy money, but a lot of LPs now have a lot of very large funding line exposure,” a partner at a London-based law firm said.
BOOSTING RETURNS
Using bridging or subscription loans instead of LPs capital can artificially inflate funds' returns by allowing managers to delay - or even avoid – calling on LPs commitments.
This boosts LPS' returns as they appear to occur in a shorter time, or with less equity investment, despite absolute returns being the same.
“Now it’s a tool to effectively avoid calling LP equity,” a co-head of sponsor finance at a bank in London said.
The loans are usually secured on either LPs capital or assets in funds' portfolios.
Some banks are seeking additional protection by asking for more collateral than the value of the loan, according to Matt Hansford, head of UK fund finance at Investec.
“You can’t assume it’s bullet-proof lending, there’s definitely risk,” Hansford said.
The ILPA proposed a set of guidelines over the use of subscription lines last year after enquiries from many LPs, and is now pushing for stronger dialogue on the issue.
Some managers are unhappy about the guidelines, which pushed the previously opaque market into the spotlight, Choi said.
“Our guidance definitely seems to have hit a nerve. The quality and level of disclosure around the use of these lines hasn’t been consistent,” she said.
UNCHECKED GROWTH
Bridging or subscription loans were previously a niche, short-term product provided sparingly by banks including Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) and Lloyds (LON:LLOY) to firms, such as BC Partners, which was one of the first to use them in 2000, the senior lawyer said.
Bridging or subscription loans are revolving credits with tenors of one to three years and are priced at around 160bp while portfolio loans are three to five-year term loans and are priced at more than 300bp, according to a bank that specializes in the deals.
This financial engineering is increasingly attractive as high valuations continue to put funds' yields under pressure.
""The decline in yields is making more and more investors say ‘why not’?”, a partner at a European private equity firm said.
Growing appetite for the deals may prove to be problematic, Choi said, particularly as the market has largely evolved since the financial crisis and has yet to face a major downturn.
Lenders have suffered no capital losses to date, according to an internal prospectus on fund financing issued by the bank specialist, seen by Thomson Reuters LPC, but potential risks remain.
“Just because we didn’t see mass incidence of LP defaults in 2008 that doesn’t mean it could never happen,” Choi said.
After the publication of ILPA’s report, a standard methodology is being discussed for the private equity industry to calculate and report funds’ internal rates of return and introduce best practice on the use of fund financing.
Many LPs are now arguing that leverage at the fund level should not total more than 20% of the fund’s overall size, the European private equity partner said.
However the availability and relatively low cost of the credit lines still makes them tempting for managers, Choi said.
""The LPs do think that if the use of these lines continues unchecked at current course and speed then it could pose real risk, and we don’t get the impression that the pace of growth has cooled off,” she added.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>",Barclays delivers on dividend despite 2017 disappointment,"By Lawrence White and Emma Rumney
LONDON (Reuters) -  Barclays  PLC (L:BARC) showed its confidence in future earnings on Thursday by restoring its full dividend, despite lackluster investment banking income, restructuring costs and U.S. tax reforms hitting the bank's 2017 bottom line.
Shares in the British bank were up 5.1 percent to 212 pence at 1043 GMT, sending Barclays to the top of the FTSE (FTSE) index risers after it said it would resume paying its full dividend of 6.5 pence per share, which it halved in March 2016 in order to provide extra funds to pay for restructuring.
""It is our firm intent, over time, to return a greater proportion of our earnings to shareholders, both through the annual dividend and in other ways,"" Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley said in a statement.
Although Barclays posted a pretax profit of 3.5 billion pounds ($4.9 billion) for 2017, up from 3.2 billion pounds a year ago, this was worse than the 4.7 billion pound average of analysts' forecasts compiled by the bank.
Those forecasts excluded conduct charges, with the bank taking a 700 million pound hit for mis-selling of payment protection insurance and a fresh 240 million pound charge relating to alleged foreign exchange manipulation.
Barclays reported a 1.9 billion pound attributable loss, after a 901 million pound tax writedown in the United States and a 2.5 billion pound loss on the sale of Barclays Africa (J:BGAJ).
But it gave no update on a Financial Conduct Authority inquiry into Staley over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower who had raised concerns about a Barclays executive.
However, it said the financial watchdog had begun a new probe into its systems and controls for the handling of customers with troubled unsecured loans. It said it could not yet estimate the financial impact of this.
PLANS IN PLACE
Barclays was the worst-performing bank in the FTSE 100 index (FTSE) in 2017, falling nine percent on concerns about both its investment bank and its legal and regulatory troubles.
Staley has championed an aggressive push in investment banking that has so far largely failed to bear fruit. 
Profit in the Barclays International division was down 22 percent in 2017, driven by a 4 percent fall in income from its investment bank and rising impairments, the bank said.
""We have strong plans in place to address that underperformance in 2018,"" Staley said.
Staley later told reporters that plans to improve the division's performance include investment in ""people, technology and balance sheet,"" without giving further details.
The CEO's pay was down 8.5 percent from the previous year, while the bank also disclosed a gender pay gap of almost 50 percent in its International unit.
Barclays' investment bank has struggled to keep pace with U.S. peers in recent quarters, despite plans announced in October to shift some 20 billion pounds in assets from corporate lending to riskier but higher-yielding trading activities.
Chief Financial Officer Tushar Morzaria said that the bank had gained market share, with business down in dollar terms by 10 percent compared with 20 percent at its biggest U.S. rivals.

1603,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 05:41AM ET</span>","Fed points upwards for rates, world stocks lurch downward","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks tumbled to one-week lows on Thursday after the U.S. Fed confirmed it was on track to raise interest rates several times this year, sending bond yields to new multi-year highs.
While U.S. 10-year yields retreated after nearing the psychologically key 3 percent level, the minutes of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of January has at least temporarily taken the edge off investors' appetite for equities and other assets perceived as risky, such as emerging markets and commodities.
With Fed policymakers agreeing that ""a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be appropriate,"" the odds in the market of faster U.S. interest rate hikes have narrowed and a host of Fed fund futures <0#FF:> have hit contract lows. 
The dollar too was trading just off 10-day highs against a basket of currencies (DXY) and was set for its first week of gains this year.
Three rate rises are now almost fully priced in for 2018, compared with two as recently as December, and some traders are even contemplating the possibility of four rate rises in 2018.
Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva, said markets seemed to have finally accepted a faster rate rise trajectory for 2018. 
But she saw no reason for an equity market collapse or sharp bond selloff. 
""When I look at the fundamentals, I see stable growth in all major economies, good earnings from the majority of companies and in a historical context, I see low interest rates and low inflation,"" Owens Thomsen said.
She was referring to 75 percent of U.S. S&P 500-listed firms which have beaten analysts' forecasts with their fourth-quarter 2017 results, while in Europe the number stands at more than 53 percent according to Thomson Reuters data.
Despite all the solid earnings reports, Wall Street saw steep losses on Wednesday after the Fed minutes, and Asian and European markets lost ground too, falling around 1 percent (MIAPJ0000PUS) (N225) (STOXX).
The latter failed to even benefit from robust earnings updates from a series of firms ranging from British bank  Barclays  (L:BARC) to French utility Veolia (PA:VIE). 
MSCI's all-country equity index (MIWD00000PUS) fell 0.4 percent for its third straight day of losses while emerging equities lost 1 percent (MSCIEF).
New York was set for another weak session, futures suggested, with S&P futures down around 0.3 percent (ESc1).
TRANSATLANTIC SPREAD WIDENING
Analysts noted that the January Fed meeting had happened after lawmakers approved a $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts, potentially adding more fuel to an economy which has already picked up steam.
The 3 percent level on 10-year U.S. yields is seen as a huge psychological milestone for bulls and bears alike. 
In the meantime though the yield, which hit four-year highs around 2.96 percent after the minutes, retreated to 2.92 percent (US10YT=RR). Two-year yields touched new nine-year peaks. 
That weighed on euro zone yields, with the German 10-year benchmark (DE10YT=RR) down one basis point. Yields were also dampened by data showing German business confidence fell more than expected in February, though Europe's biggest economy is clearly set for solid growth.
The next hurdle for markets will be minutes from the European Central Bank's last meeting at 1230 GMT, with investors keen to see if there was more talk of an eventual unwinding of stimulus.
The ""transatlantic spread"" between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs widened to near a year high at 220 bps, reflecting the diverging monetary policy expectations between the two countries.
Britain however confirmed itself as one of the weak spots in the world economy, with data showing below-forecast 0.4 percent growth in the last quarter of 2017. That pushed sterling 0.2 percent lower against the dollar , a one-week low.

The firmer dollar pummeled commodities too - Brent crude futures were down 0.4 percent  while gold and copper prices also fell  .

Modi, his companies, and other firms with links to his uncle Mehul Choksi, are at the heart of the alleged fraud that involved illegally issued letters of undertaking (LOUs) from the second-largest Indian state-run lender that were used to get loans from overseas branches of mostly Indian banks.
In what has been dubbed the biggest fraud in India's banking history, police have so far arrested a dozen people - six from the bank and six more from Modi and Choksi's companies - as they continue the probe.
A lawyer for Modi has denied his client was involved in any fraud. Choksi has not commented but his firm,  Gitanjali Gems  (NS:GTGM), has also denied involvement in the alleged fraud.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED), an Indian agency focused on foreign exchange and money laundering offences, has been conducting separate searches at homes and offices of Modi. As of last Saturday, it had seized jewelry, gold, diamonds, precious metals and stones that it said were worth 56.74 billion rupees ($872.5 million).
In a Twitter post on Thursday, the ED detailed the seizures of the cars from Modi and his companies. It also said it had frozen shares and mutual funds worth 78 million rupees held by Modi and 867.2 million rupees by Choksi.
Modi, who police say left India in January with his family before the bank filed a police complaint triggering an inquiry, has not publicly commented on the case yet.

However, in a letter to PNB, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, Modi had said that his companies owed the bank less than 50 billion rupees, well below the amount alleged by the bank. He also said PNB had jeopardized its prospects of recovering the sums owed by going public with its allegations.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 05:21AM ET</span>",Prosecutors widen Audi emissions probe to former executives,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors searched the homes of three new suspects in connection with Audi's emissions scandal on Thursday, further widening their inquiry into the carmaker's test-cheating scandal to include former executives.
About two weeks after raiding Audi's headquarters and one of its two German plants, Munich prosecutors said two of the three individuals affected by Thursday's searches are former members of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) division's top management board.
Current Audi executives are still not among the suspects, the number of which has risen to 17, prosecutors said, adding the new suspects were considered to be partly responsible for the emissions trickery.
Thursday's searches overshadow a meeting of Audi's supervisory board that is expected to discuss the luxury brand's 2017 financial results, giving the latest proof that the Volkswagen (VW) group cannot seem to catch a break from its ""Dieselgate"" crisis.
Last week, Audi's chairman appealed to workers to ignore a media report saying the carmaker's embattled chief executive, Rupert Stadler, was about to be fired. 
Audi said on Thursday it was cooperating with prosecutors while parent VW declined comment.
Audi, VW's main profit contributor, did not admit to using illicit emissions control devices in the United States until November 2015, two months after the scandal at parent VW was revealed.

The Ingolstadt-based carmaker developed the bigger 3.0 liter V6 diesel engines used in about 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche models that in 2015 were found to be equipped with illicit software and to exceed U.S. emissions limits.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>","Nippon Life CIO: 'Goldilocks' scenario near end, plans to sell stocks into rally","By Tomo Uetake and Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nippon Life Insurance Co [NPNLI.UL] is likely to sell Japanese shares when they rise further, as the rally in risk assets driven by expectations of a ""Goldilocks"" scenario continuing is nearing an end, its chief investment officer told Reuters on Thursday.
The insurer also expects the dollar may soften further against the yen but it is ready to buy the U.S. currency when it falls below 105 yen, Hiroshi Ozeki added.
Global shares were rocked by a sell-off earlier this month, after strong U.S. wage data stoked fears that inflation may accelerate, shaking the prevailing view that U.S. borrowing costs will remain contained.
Although global shares have bounced back in the past week or so, Nippon Life expects risk assets could be pummeled again.
Ozeki said market expectations of a ""Goldilocks"" scenario, one that is not too hot nor too cold, are based on the assumption of three ""moderations"" -- moderate economic growth, moderate inflation and a moderate rise in asset prices.
""When any of those three disappear, there will be market corrections,"" he said.
""Since Abenomics began (in 2012), our stance on Japanese stocks has been to 'buy-on-dips'. But with their valuations at lofty levels, we are no longer increasing our stock portfolio.
""As the end of Goldilocks markets approaches, we have to prepare ourself for tumbles in share prices,"" he said.
Nippon Life expects the dollar could fall further against the yen but given it is approaching levels in line with its fair value in purchasing power parity terms, it is ready to buy dollars below 105 yen, Ozeki said.
The dollar fell to a 15-month low of 105.545 yen  last week compared with 112.71 yen at the end of last year, on investor risk aversion following a slide in global stock prices.
Ozeki said the company does not expect a major market crash yet but added a real test for markets will come when the combined balance sheet of the world's three biggest central banks -- the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan -- start to shrink.
Right now, while the Fed started to trim its balance sheet, the ECB and the BOJ are still gobbling up bonds.
""(After the latest market volatilities,) everybody is trying to see if any bubbles are formed anywhere...I would think government bonds are the most expensive and what comes next will be a burst of the government bond bubble, even if not right away,"" he added. 

The firm has total assets of 67.4 trillion yen ($630 billion).

1614,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 03:31AM ET</span>",Mining Churns Out Cash as Anglo Boosts Profit and Dividend,"(Bloomberg) -- It’s now a familiar refrain in mining: skyrocketing earnings, a hefty dividend and lighter debt burden.
 Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc, the last of the big London mining companies to report annual results, held true to that theme today. Earnings jumped in 2017 on a surge in commodity prices and the company raised its full-year dividend to $1.02 a share. Debt was cut in half to $4.5 billion during the year.
“Anglo American released another good set of financial results this morning,” wrote Paul Gait, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. in London. “Clearly the focus has been on the impressive deleveraging, but the dividend, which was resumed earlier than expected at first-half results, is still robust.”
 Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) Group,  Glencore  (LON:GLEN) Plc and BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) Ltd. have all reported massive profits in the past month as the resurgence in global growth sent raw material prices back to multi-year highs. They have all promised higher dividends, a reward for shareholders who stuck with the companies during the commodities crisis of 2015.
Anglo shares slid 2.6 percent to 1,750.20 pence as of 8:40 a.m. local time. The company’s underlying earnings came in just shy of analyst estimates, and industrial metal prices slumped in London trading. The stock is up 33 percent in the past year.
Among the big miners, Anglo’s rebound was one of the most impressive. It was on the brink of disaster in 2015, forcing it scrap the dividend and put mines up for sale. Now, the mines it considered selling are making the most money and Anglo is starting to consider expanding some projects.
“We believe there is significant additional upside within the business both through further operating gains and from selected organic growth options,” said Chief Executive Officer Mark Cutifani.
In one sign of Anglo’s newfound confidence, Cutifani said Anglo may choose to exceed its own dividend policy. Currently, the company pays out a set percentage of earnings, but may choose to go above that level in the future.
Anglo’s debt fell to $4.5 billion by the end of 2017, compared with the $7 billion target made at the start of the year.
Underlying earnings were $2.57 a share, compared with from $1.72 in the previous year. That compares with the average analyst estimate of $2.60 a share.
Anglo said will target an extra $3 billion to $4 billion in savings by 2022 through cost reductions and better productivity.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 01:41AM ET</span>",Seed firms scramble to stop a 'cancer' in Canada's cash crop,"By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Inside a laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba, a  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) Co research technician uses tweezers to transfer pollen from one canola plant to another, a small step toward creating a new breed of the vegetable oil-producing crop.
It's an early stage of a high-stakes effort to control the biggest threat to Canada's C$27-billion canola industry - a crop disease called clubroot that presents unique challenges for Monsanto, along with rival seed developers DowDuPont and  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN).
The firms are scrambling to create new clubroot-resistant seeds, but all three firms say that the process takes most of a decade - and any solution may not last long because the clubroot pathogen quickly adapts. Worse, clubroot spores make themselves at home in the soil for up to 20 years, unlike most crop diseases that damage harvests for a single season.
Another challenge is canola farmers themselves, who have rapidly spread clubroot by planting record canola crops for the last two years. The best way to avoid the disease is for farmers to give fields at least a two-year break between canola sowings. But with canola consistently delivering much higher profits than wheat, many are unable to resist.
Farmer Bill Craddock acknowledged he plants canola with only a one-year break in Manitoba, where clubroot first appeared in 2013.
""We don't really want to back off,"" he said. ""There's just more money in canola.""
The crop - Canada's most profitable - provides big earnings for the seed firms, too. Canola accounts for one-third of Monsanto's total annual Canadian revenue, said spokeswoman Trish Jordan, who declined to specify the amount. 
""Companies are very mindful of it because the consequences are huge,"" said David Dzisiak, DowDuPont's North America commercial leader in grains and oils. ""If farmers can't grow their most profitable crop, we can't sell it.""
DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) Pioneer Canada, a unit of DowDuPont, has the largest market share of Canadian clubroot-resistant seeds, according to Monsanto. DowDuPont, which declined to confirm its market position, may add to its lead on the others as it broadly launches a new clubroot-resistant seed this year after introducing it last year on a small scale.
Monsanto hopes to have a new disease-resistant canola seed on the market in two to four years. Bayer expects to have a variety in two to five years.
But all firms face uncertainty because the clubroot pathogen adapts rapidly and not all pathotypes have been identified, said Marcus Weidler, vice-president of seeds operations at Bayer Crop Science.
""Sooner or later, the pathogen will find a way around it,"" Weidler said. 
""WILD"" RUTABAGA CROSSBREEDS
Yellow-flowering canola, called rapeseed in other countries, is grown and exported in Canada more than anywhere else. Canola seeds are crushed by Cargill Inc (CARG.UL), Archer Daniels Midland Co, Bunge Ltd and Louis Dreyfus Corp for vegetable oil used, for instance, in French fries, potato chips and granola bars produced by McDonald's Corp, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc and  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS).
Clubroot first hit Western Canada's canola in 2003 but dates back centuries in Europe. It has now been found on all agriculture-producing continents, often in vegetable farms, but it has rarely affected crops as widely planted as canola in Canada.
It remains a ""seriously increasing problem"" in Europe, especially in rapeseed-intensive areas of northern Germany and Sweden, said Elke Diederichsen, a biologist at Free University Berlin.
Developing clubroot-resistant seeds takes many years because it requires painstaking crossbreeding with plant relatives such as rutabaga, cabbage or turnip. Resistant genes do not exist naturally within the canola plants.
""The first generations of a canola-by-rutabaga cross will look pretty wild,"" said Jed Christianson, trait lead at Monsanto's Winnipeg office, where some 30 breeders and technicians are involved in the search for clubroot solutions.
Clad in lab coats, masks, goggles and gloves, they work on rows of hundreds of canola plants, ranging from petri dishes of tiny floating embryos to tall stalks topped with yellow blossoms.
Monsanto's early results in breeding canola and rutabaga produced misshapen or oversized leaves, and main roots that ranged in width from a finger to a fist.
Promising candidates that graduate from Monsanto's earthy-smelling ""growth rooms"" move on to years of field trials across the Canadian Prairies and seed production in Chile. The strategy allows Monsanto to take advantage of northern and southern hemispheres to grow plants year-round and speed the process.
Monsanto released its first clubroot-resistant seed in 2009, but just three years later, the disease showed up in those fields, too - sending Monsanto and rival firms scrambling for new solutions.
""That's a very short period of time,"" Christianson said. ""It was a bit alarming.""
LIKE 'CANCER'
The long-term damage to fields makes fighting clubroot all the more urgent, said Igor Falak, senior research scientist at DuPont Pioneer Canada.
“If you don’t have resistance, you can’t grow canola at all in some areas,"" Falak said in an interview.
Each gram of dirt in an infected field can host 100 million clubroot spores, which spread by wind, water, farm machinery - even a farmer's boots.
""It's a lot like being told you have cancer,"" said Alberta farmer John Guelly. ""You feel helpless, and you're not sure what you can do.""
Clubroot infected Guelly's crops and forced him to plant less profitable wheat and barley for the next two years and adopt ongoing two-year breaks in canola plantings.
Farmers, seed companies and industry groups told Reuters the disease is spreading fast, but the data to quantify the damage is incomplete.
In Alberta, the second-biggest canola-producing province, clubroot damage has been confirmed in 2,744 fields, or about 50 percent more than three years ago, according to University of Alberta. 
Most of those fields span about 160 acres, said Stephen Strelkov, an agriculture professor at the university. That much land would translate to about 439,000 acres that now have limited canola-growing potential, representing 6 percent of Alberta's total canola cropland last year.
But many more fields may go undetected, in part because clubroot carries a stigma. Some farmers hesitate to report its spread for fear that land values will fall or out of embarrassment, Guelly said.
Many farmers also resist steps that might slow the spread of clubroot because it presents unusual economic dilemmas.
In Saskatchewan, the biggest canola-growing province, where clubroot first appeared in 2008, canola is expected to net farmers this year double or triple the return per acre of spring wheat, according to a provincial government forecast.
In addition, farmers who gamble on back-to-back canola sowings - rather than letting fields recover - may still initially reap good harvests until clubroot spreads enough to substantially lower yields.
Clubroot produces swellings on canola's roots, choking them of nutrients and stunting growth of the plant's valuable seeds, but the disease does not affect the quality of canola oil and meal.
The seriousness of the disease has prompted some Alberta municipalities to ban canola plantings in certain infected fields for three years. The goal is to prevent farmers from making decisions that make economic sense in the short-term but cause lasting damage to the industry at large.
""If we aren’t putting in restrictions, they’ll keep planting canola and putting everyone else at risk,"" said Aaron Van Beers, agriculture foreman for Leduc County south of Edmonton.
Weidler, from Bayer, agreed the problem demands a broad strategy. 

""We need a lot more research,"" he said. ""We need an effort from the whole industry to keep this under control.""

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>","How General Electric gambled on fossil fuel power, and lost","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Last March, executives at  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's power-plant business gave Wall Street a surprisingly bullish forecast for the year. Despite flat demand for new natural gas power plants, they said, GE Power's revenue and profit would rise.
Showing data from financial firm Lazard and other sources, their presentation said natural gas, coal and even some nuclear power plants were the lowest-cost producers of electricity on the planet, cheaper than wind or solar. 
""Gas is the most economical energy source today,"" one slide read. In the days following the conference, GE's shares rose 2 percent.
But GE's forecast turned out to be a mirage.
Rather than rising, GE Power's profit fell 45 percent last year, forcing GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression. Its shares have plunged more than 50 percent since the March forecast. Former CEO Jeff Immelt was replaced in August.
John Flannery, GE's new chief executive, blamed the forecast, along with poor management and other factors, for the power business meltdown. In January, he warned the pain would continue this year ""and potentially be worse than expected.""
What GE has not emphasized is that wind and solar now cost substantially less than gas and other conventional energy sources - and have for years, according to a widely respected energy cost report Lazard has published since 2008.
For graphic showing energy costs and other details, click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2Fge6ra
GE said Lazard was one data source for its March forecast, which also weighed the high efficiency of GE's latest gas power plants and other factors. GE said cost ""is not the only predictor"" of the power source utilities will choose. They may also value the reliability of fossil fuels over wind and solar.
""We have a rigorous financial planning process,"" GE said in response to questions from Reuters.
But according to more than a dozen former executives, rivals and energy experts interviewed by Reuters, GE's reading of the market left the company deeply vulnerable to the sudden drop in demand for conventional power plants, as sales of wind and solar surged. 
""There are just fewer gas turbines being bought,"" one former GE executive said. ""The market is not flat, it's down.""
Power is not GE's only problem. Its financing arm, GE Capital, took a massive, unexpected charge that contributed to a nearly $10 billion loss in the fourth quarter and prompted U.S. regulators to broaden an ongoing probe of its accounting practices. Profit also fell sharply at GE's separate oil and gas and locomotive businesses last year, and Flannery has suggested he may break up the company.
But power is one of GE's oldest and largest businesses, and supplied 60 percent of the conglomerate's profit as recently as 2016. Now, GE is cutting 12,000 jobs, 18 percent of the unit's workforce, after announcing 6,500 job cuts in early 2016. 
On Wednesday, GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller warned of ""a little bit more noise"" at GE Power, calling 2018 ""a reset and stabilization year"" for the division.
She declined to predict when GE Power would regain double-digit profit margins it had in 2016, and said turning it around ""will take a good 12 to 18 months.""
DOUBLING DOWN
GE doubled down on fossil fuel in 2015 with the $10.3 billion purchase of French group Alstom's power business. The deal expanded GE's exposure to gas, coal and nuclear power just as solar costs fell below those of gas-powered plants, according to Lazard.
The  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) deal added 65,000 employees to GE's payroll and dozens of factories and service centers around the globe at a time when GE was trying to cut costs. 
Orders for GE's newest, large gas-fired turbines have fallen 35 percent in the two years since the deal closed, and industry estimates show demand for conventional plants is unlikely to hit 2017 levels again for at least a decade. 
The cost gap between renewable and conventional power is still widening, and some utilities already are mothballing older fossil plants, using them only to supplement wind and solar.
Other companies also were hit by the decline in sales. But competitors  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn) and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems were cautious. Paul Browning, Chief Executive of MHPS North America, said his company watched wind and solar power costs fall 12 percent a year for more than a decade. 
""We did see a lot of this coming and didn't make acquisitions or build up a lot of facilities, people or inventory,"" Browning said in an interview.
While Alstom gave GE more than $14 billion more in annual revenue, Alstom's profit margins were less than one-third of GE's. Immelt saw that as an opportunity. 
""If we thought this was a 6 percent margin business that we couldn't dramatically improve, we are not going to do it,"" Immelt said of the Alstom purchase in May 2014. ""We are basically in similar businesses in the same market, and we run our business at a 20 percent margin.""
But regulators required GE to sell the power-plant service arm of Alstom, a Florida-based company called Power Systems Manufacturing that had long been a competitor to GE, Mitsubishi and Siemens. 
GE, which had counted on that business serving a large base of plants around the world to make Alstom more profitable, bid aggressively on service deals to avoid losing them to competitors, according to three people familiar with the bidding. 
That has raised concerns among investors that it is locked into service contracts that will not be profitable.
Rather than improving Alstom's margins, GE Power's margin plunged to 7.7 percent last year from 21 percent before the acquisition. 
In response to questions from Reuters, GE said lucrative income from fixing downed power plants fell by half last year, a major hit to profits.
But it defended the Alstom purchase, which instantly gave it 50 percent more plants to service, something that would take half a century to build up from scratch. Since it is a long-term business, GE said, and ""we have opportunity to improve the performance in the future.""
LIGHTING UP THE WORLD... FOR NOW
GE's power plants generate one-third of the world's electricity, giving it a large installed base for services revenue. 
But industry experts point out that GE's gas power plants are mainly older F-Class units, rather than the new, larger H-Class turbines. Older gas-fired plants often cannot compete with wind and solar, especially when governments provide subsidies, said Stuart Slade, director of consulting at market research firm Forecast International. 
""There are a lot of single-cycle gas plants being mothballed,"" Slade said.
Alstom inflicted other blows: New Alstom orders fell off in the 18 months before the deal closed as customers held back on purchases. That gave competitors scope to gain market share, according to people familiar with the sales competitions. 
GE has sold the largest number F-Class power plants. But it is in third place behind Mitsubishi and Siemens in competition for the newest, largest and most fuel-efficient H-Class turbines, according to McCoy Power Reports, an industry research company.
Orders for all of GE Power's plants and services have fallen 13 percent since 2016, a decline that accelerated at the end of last year. GE also wrote off some of the equipment it built up as part of an $850 million charge it took in the fourth quarter. GE did not rule out further write offs, in response to questions from Reuters.
Miller and GE Power Chief Executive Russell Stokes have said the problems are fixable, and the company acknowledged in a recent strategy paper that wind and solar are a fast-growing part of the world's energy supply. 
Still, GE downplays the threat to its bulked up fossil fuel product line. Despite rapid growth of wind and solar, it says, two-thirds of power generation will come from gas, coal and nuclear plants over the next decade.

""The transformation will not happen overnight,"" GE said in the strategy paper.

1623,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 01:15AM ET</span>","Distrust of unions, and GM, hangs over South Korean efforts to stem job losses","By Cynthia Kim and Ju-min Park
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in is in a bind.
Either he risks losing political capital and thousands of high-paying jobs if General Motors (NYSE:GM) cuts its presence in South Korea, or he faces a public backlash if he uses taxpayer money as a lifeline for the U.S. automaker. 
Last week, GM announced it would shut down a factory in Gunsan, southwest of Seoul, and said it was mulling the fate of its three remaining plants in South Korea. It wants help from the government to restructure and keep the plants operating. 
Although coffers are full in both the government and Korea Development Bank, which owns a 17 percent stake in GM Korea, officials say likely opposition from South Koreans makes any financial support for the Detroit auto maker politically tricky. 
""We cannot be free from the potential public backlash expected from helping a private company using taxpayers' money,"" said one government official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the ongoing discussions.
On top of that, public support for South Korea's auto worker unions, which have a reputation for militancy, has fallen as young workers battle to find increasingly rare full-time positions. 
A survey released on Thursday showed 30 percent of respondents oppose any public aid for the automaker, with 56 percent backing support only if GM lays out a feasible turnaround plan. According to the survey by pollster Realmeter, just 6 percent say the government should inject public funds unconditionally to save jobs. 
Moon came to office last year on a platform of job creation, and swiftly proposed a 11 trillion won ($10 billion) supplementary budget to add hundreds of thousands of public sector positions.
Amid ongoing corruption scandals rocking some of South Korea's largest companies, however, Moon also promised to reform an overly intimate relationship between government and large corporations.
Past government interventions in the private sector have not always been successful either.
South Korea's shipbuilding sector is still floundering despite an injection of more than 7.1 trillion won into Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co since 2015 - the biggest bailout of a single company in over a decade.
UNIONS AND UNEMPLOYMENT
Moon's office said this week it would make Gunsan, where GM is closing its plant, an ""employment crisis zone"" to provide financial support for affected workers.
GM has launched a voluntary redundancy program for all of its roughly 16,000 workers in South Korea.
There are also concerns a complete pullout by GM would send shockwaves through the automaker supply chain, putting a further 140,000 Korean suppliers and subcontractors at risk.
""If President Moon Jae-in does not fix this issue properly, it will snowball and come back to him as a larger problem,"" said Lee Young-su, a seven-year veteran of the auto maker's Bupyeong factory, where officials are still debating the plant's future. ""The Moon Jae-in government should protect jobs as much as create new jobs.""
Complicating the matter is a lack of popular sympathy in saving jobs for the unions at big corporations which are often derided as ""aristocratic"" by South Koreans struggling in a cutthroat job market.
Many young South Korean see such labor organizations as protecting generous conditions for older workers such as children's college tuition fees and vehicles at their expense. 
Unemployment for young South Koreans is running at a record high of 9.8 percent in 2017, almost three times of the national average of 3.7 percent.
GM executives have complained that South Korea's relatively high wages and its unyielding unions have contributed to its problems in the country.
Leaders at GM Korea's union, however, blame the company for reducing output after GM scrapped sales of its Chevy brand in Europe. South Korea was previously a major export base for GM globally.
Ham Jin-gyu, a policy chief for the conservative Liberty Korea Party said he opposed spending any public funds without concessions by both GM Korea and the union.
""(The government) should not pour taxpayers’ money into something without holding GM headquarters accountable for its opaque management and securing a promise from the constantly hard-line aristocrat union to share the pain,"" Ham said. 
YEARS OF WARNING
With South Koreans widely distrustful of foreign firms on concerns that their profits go offshore, handing an American company like GM a lifeline is particularly controversial.
The tensions also come at a difficult time for U.S.-South Korean relations given U.S. President Donald Trump's determination to renegotiate the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement.
""With Trump being hawkish, South Koreans probably won’t be happy with the government if taxpayers money is used,"" said Chung Chul, an economist at the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy.
GM has proposed a debt-for-equity swap and fresh investment in its South Korea unit, while the South Korean government wants an audit on the company and its ""opaque management"" before any aid is approved.

""So many jobs are at stake and how to deal with GM issue is connected to government policy,"" said one KDB official. ""So the government and KDB can’t simply jump to conclusions. If someone says he’s sick, then we need to cut open his abdomen to find the problem.""

1624,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 22, 2018 01:01AM ET</span>",Fed's Quarles Says U.S. Economy in `Best Shape' Since Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Governor Randal Quarles delivered an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy and endorsed a “gradual” path for raising interest rates in his first public speech on monetary policy since joining the central bank in October.
“The U.S. economy appears to be performing very well and, certainly, is in the best shape that it has been in since the crisis and, by many metrics, since well before the crisis,” Quarles said in prepared remarks Thursday in Tokyo.
“With a strong labor market and likely only temporary softness in inflation, I view it as appropriate that monetary policy should continue to be gradually normalized,” he said. The views appear to align Quarles on monetary policy with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who testifies next week before Congress for the first time as central bank chief.
His comments follow the release of minutes from the Fed’s Jan. 30-31 policy meeting that showed confidence growing among policy makers that growth in 2018 may exceed their December forecasts and justify additional rate hikes this year. Officials have penciled in three hikes in 2018, according to their median projection released in December.
Quarles, who was named to the central bank’s board by President Donald Trump, said recently enacted tax changes and bipartisan budget deals could help sustain the economy’s expansion by increasing demand and spurring business investment. He also drew attention to capital investment data that had already improved in 2017.
‘Drought’ Fading
“It might be early, but it is possible that the investment drought that has afflicted the U.S. economy for the past five years may finally be breaking,” he said.
On the riddle of lower-than-expected inflation in 2017, Quarles said it was likely due to “transitory factors that will fade through 2018.”
“A deviation from our target of a few tenths of 1 percentage point, especially one I expect to fade, does not cause me great concern,” he said.
Quarles, who’s also the Fed’s vice chairman for supervision of financial institutions, said he hoped to improve the regulatory framework the Fed and other agencies spent a decade putting in place after the financial crisis of 2008-09. His appointment to that role has spurred warnings from Democratic lawmakers not to dismantle post-crisis reforms.
“Given the breadth and complexity of this new body of regulation, it is inevitable that we will be able to improve them, especially with the benefit of experience and hindsight,” he said.

“The impulse to the economy is going to be quite positive” on top of already bright growth and job-market prospects, said Mohamed Faiz Nagutha, an economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). “This makes us more confident that MAS will exit its neutral policy in April. We still think it will be very gradual.”

The central bank stuck to a neutral stance in its previous October decision, while giving itself room to tighten policy if necessary. The MAS, which uses the exchange rate as its main tool, eased three times between January 2015 and April 2016.
The projected budget deficit for next year also had  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG economists affirming their forecasts for the period. While immediate tax hikes were limited in the budget, giving less of a bump to inflation, the economy has been picking up and consumption is well supported, said Michael Wan, a Singapore-based economist at the bank.
Given that the economy is expected to “do quite well this year, we still think the MAS will tighten exchange-rate policy,” probably in October, he said.
Inflation pressures remain muted, with a report on Friday probably showing consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in January from a year ago, the same pace as in December, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The MAS forecasts its core inflation measure, which reached 1.3 percent in December, will average 1 percent to 2 percent this year.
Economists at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). see the fiscal expansion as having a “more muted” impact on growth for 2018 than the numbers suggest, in part because a S$5 billion ($3.8 billion) increase in rail infrastructure funding will probably be spread out over multiple years, according to a research note Thursday. They are sticking to their forecast that the MAS will tighten in October as demand remains strong and inflationary pressures rise.
Eclectic Budget
The overall budget was an eclectic mix, with Irvin Seah at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. calling it a “give and take” document with “some goodies for everyone.”
Fresh taxes -- some delayed -- were a reminder that Singapore will need to find more revenue for increased spending on healthcare, infrastructure and security in the decade ahead. But enhanced tax cuts, as well as a one-time bonus payment and boost to ministries’ spending this year, were enough to juice an economy that was already looking pretty solid after a strong 2017.
“Singapore’s strong budgetary position and a healthy economy has allowed the government to focus on medium to long-term initiatives,” Christian de Guzman, lead sovereign analyst at Moody’s Singapore Pte Ltd., said in a research note.
Forward thinking was evident in Singapore’s “tailoring the tax system to incentivize innovation, meet the country’s climate change commitments, and acknowledge the rising proportion of economic activity that falls outside of the traditional tax net,” de Guzman wrote.

QUERETARO, Mexico (Reuters) - French aero engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) expects to be producing 20,000 composite fan blades for the LEAP jet engine by 2021 at its new plant in central Mexico's Queretaro state, the company's chief executive Philippe Petitcolin said on Wednesday.
The composites plant, a joint $100 million investment with Albany International, was built to meet record order books for new LEAP engines and an increase in production rates requested by planemakers, especially Boeing's (N:BA) 737 MAX.
In Mexico, there are orders for LEAP engines for 60 Aeromexico 737 aircraft and 35 A320neo aircraft for Interjet, said Safran.
""We want to open more plants in Mexico, in Queretaro. It's a possibility and will depend on demand,"" Petitcolin told reporters.

The new plant, the third joint venture between the firms, was officially inaugurated on Wednesday but already delivered its first parts in October. It makes 3D woven composite fan blades for the LEAP engine from CFM International.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  said on Wednesday that Raj Nair, its president for North America, was leaving the company immediately after an internal investigation found his behavior was ""inconsistent with the company's code of conduct."" 
Ford did not give any details on what that behavior entailed. A company spokesman said the review was launched in the past few weeks after Ford received a report of inappropriate behavior.
Nair's departure comes after several high-profile business leaders and politicians have quit or been fired in the past year following accusations of sexual harassment, with the social media movement known as #MeToo pressing for more accountability in corporate cultures. 
""We made this decision after a thorough review and careful consideration,"" said Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett in a statement. ""Ford is deeply committed to providing and nurturing a safe and respectful culture and we expect our leaders to fully uphold these values.""
As North American chief, Nair was responsible for operations that generate about 90 percent of Ford’s global profits.
Nair apologized, without elaborating. 
""I sincerely regret that there have been instances where I have not exhibited leadership behaviors consistent with the principles that the Company and I have always espoused,"" Nair said in Ford's statement.
The company is not investigating other executives for similar cases, a Ford spokesman said.
Nair, 53, was appointed to his current position last May when Hackett became CEO of the No. 2 U.S. automaker. 
Nair previously served as Ford's chief technical officer. He joined Ford in 1987 and rose through the automaker's manufacturing and engineering ranks to become head of global product development in 2015.
Nair stands to lose about $4.8 million worth of Ford restricted shares he was granted in May 2017 that would have vested had a remained with the company until May 2020.
In August, Ford agreed to pay up to $10.125 million to settle an investigation into sex and race harassment at two plants in Chicago conducted by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). 
The EEOC said female and African-American employees had been subjected to sexual and racial harassment and found the automaker retaliated against employees who complained about the harassment or discrimination. 
In an open letter after the New York Times published a widely read article on the matter, Hackett wrote ""there is absolutely no room for harassment at Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)."" 
""We don't want you here, and we will move you out for engaging in any behavior like this,"" he wrote.
Ford has been working to effect a turnaround in its operations to improve profitability as Ford's automotive profit margins have shrunk. 
In emailed commentary, Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader, the online market for cars, said this comes ""at a particularly bad time for Ford.""
""Investors and analysts have been unhappy with the seeming lack of a clear direction for Ford,"" she said. ""The pressure is on Jim Hackett... to lay out a clear road ahead for Ford.""
The company's margins have fallen behind rivals General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV.
Year to date, Ford shares are down 14 percent. 
In extended trading on Wednesday, Ford shares were unchanged from their official close of $10.60.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Ray Dalio, who founded world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, thinks there is a relatively high chance the U.S. economy will stumble into a recession before the next presidential election in 2020.
Dalio said the U.S. economy is not currently in a bubble. But he reasoned that it might not take long to get there and then to move on to a ""bust"" phase.
""I think we are in a pre-bubble stage that could go into a bubble stage ... The probability of a recession prior to the next presidential election would be relatively high, maybe 70 percent, Dalio said during an appearance at the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics.
Dalio, whose fund invests some $160 billion, stepped down from the hedge fund's day-to-day operations nearly a year ago, but his views on markets and the economy are still very closely followed.
At the event, Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former Harvard president, asked Dalio questions including what advice he would give individual investors who may have been rattled by the market's recent turbulence after years of steady gains.
Dalio said investors should not panic and need to have a sound plan. If people become scared after the market has tumbled, it is too late, Dalio said, adding that people should probably buy when they are frightened and sell when they are not.
""The greatest mistake of the individual investor is to think that a market that did well is a good market rather than a more expensive market,"" he said.
Dalio refused to discuss the firm's portfolio and said that many of Bridgewater's moves could be easily misinterpreted, including recent short bets against a number of European companies. ""Don't read anything into that. You'll probably be misled.""

The Federal Reserve’s latest comment solidified expectations of interest rate hike ahead, as it showed increasing confidence that economic growth would pick up steam despite of concerns around inflation. Fed policy makers would next meet on 20 March.
The Dow closed 0.67% lower, while the S&P 500 fell 0.55% and the Nasdaq 0.22%.
Mainland Chinese markets were in focus today as they resumed trading after a week-long Lunar New Year holiday and were the only markets trading in the green in Asia Thursday morning. The Shanghai Composite gained 1.43% while the Shenzhen Component also jumped 1.1%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.2%.
Japan’s Nikkei and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 retreated following the U.S. stocks’ negative reaction to the Fed minutes. The yen gained some strength against the USD, with USD/JPY down 0.53% to 107.19. BHP Billiton rebounded more than 1% after losing almost 5% yesterday following a disappointing earnings report.
Elsewhere, the KOSPI was down 0.42% while the won also lost ground, quoted at 1,082 per dollar. Lotte Corp continued to receive some attention as the company said cooperation between Japanese and South Korean Lotte units would “inevitably” weaken following the sentencing of Shin Dong-bin."
1631,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 08:18PM ET</span>","GE eyes $4 billion in asset sales, has no plans to sell stock: CFO","By Alwyn Scott
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) has ""line of sight"" on the first $4 billion in asset sales under its plans for $20 billion in disposals, the company's chief financial officer said on Wednesday, while dismissing talk about selling shares to raise capital.
Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller, speaking to an investor conference organized by  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in Miami, did not elaborate on the planned asset sales. The disposals could cut cash flow by less than $500 million in 2019, but would have no impact in 2018, she said.
GE has said it plans to sell its transportation unit, which makes railway locomotives; the iconic lighting division that makes bulbs for consumers, and a connections business that sells motors, generators and automation and electrical grid equipment. 
Miller said GE does not plan to quickly sell its 62.5 percent stake in oilfield services business  Baker Hughes  (N:BHGE) before the expiration of a two-year lockup period, reversing an earlier stance that had cast uncertainty around Baker Hughes. Baker Hughes shares rose on Wednesday.
Speaking at an another investor conference in Miami, organized by  Barclays  (LON:BARC), Miller said GE has no plans to raise equity to strengthen its balance sheet.
Miller said the company has gone through a ""fairly deep dive into the different elements of the company. And we have no plans for an equity raise. It's not been discussed,"" Miller said.
GE's chief executive officer, John Flannery, last month spurred speculation about a possible break-up of the 126-year-old conglomerate when he said GE was considering ""all options."" 
Miller said Flannery was talking about capital allocation. ""We're examining everything,"" she said. ""But it doesn't mean we don't run the company extraordinarily well, and it doesn't mean it's to the exclusion of other stakeholders, too.""
Miller warned of ""a little bit more noise"" before GE Power recovers from a 45 percent profit drop last year. She called 2018 ""a reset and stabilization year"" for the division, which makes power plants and equipment.
""Turning it around ""will take a good 12 to 18 months,"" Miller said. She declined to predict when GE Power would regain the double-digit profit margins it had in 2016.

""I think in the next couple of years, we will have good line of sight to that shift,"" Miller said.

The U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which designates which financial companies would pose a risk to the country’s financial system if they failed, said on Wednesday it discussed the “annual re-evaluation of the designation of a non-bank financial company”.
Prudential (LON:PRU) had previously confirmed it was the company concerned.
The insurer is the only non-bank financial company currently designated as a “systemically important financial institution” by FSOC. The panel last year released rival insurer AIG (N:AIG) from the label and agreed this month to drop its earlier appeal against a court decision releasing MetLife (NYSE:MET) from the designation.
FSOC did not provide any further information on the review, which is likely to last several months.
The regulatory panel also discussed recent volatility in the financial markets, including fluctuations in cryptocurrency futures and the impact on financial institutions, it said in the notice.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 06:16PM ET</span>",Exclusive: India's PNB adopts strict SWIFT controls after mega fraud case,"By Rajendra Jadhav and Krishna N. Das
MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's state-run  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) has stepped up its controls on the use of global payments network SWIFT following an alleged $1.77 billion fraud, according to memos issued this month and seen by Reuters.
India's second biggest state lender this month revealed the country's biggest loan fraud, which it alleges was committed by two junior officials at a Mumbai branch, who issued unauthorized ""letters of undertaking"" (LOU) via SWIFT, for firms linked to a billionaire jeweler Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi.
The undertakings, which PNB says were issued between 2011 and 2017 with incomplete ledger entries by the two officials, were used by Modi and Choksi's firms to obtain credit from the overseas branches of mostly Indian lenders.
A lawyer for Modi has denied his client was involved in any fraud. Choksi has not commented but his firm,  Gitanjali Gems  (NS:GTGM), has also denied involvement in the alleged fraud.
The new measures mean only PNB officers will be able to initiate messages on SWIFT, taking away the authority of clerks to do so. Several new limits have been placed on the amount that officers can generate depending on their seniority in the bank hierarchy.
The note sent by the bank's head office in New Delhi to all regional offices on Feb. 17 also stated any SWIFT message will have to be created, verified and authorized by three different officers, starting Thursday. Previously only two individuals were needed for the process.
""In continuation of efforts to strengthen SWIFT operation and deploy additional measures to ensure more effective control, it has been decided to set up SWIFT user base limits,"" the note went on to say.
A SWIFT spokeswoman in Brussels said it was aware of the reports around PNB but that it could not comment on individual customers.
""When a case of potential fraud is reported to us, we offer our assistance to the affected user to help secure its environment,"" Natasha de Terán said. ""SWIFT can reassure customers that there is no indication the SWIFT network has been compromised.""
NEW DIVISION
PNB has also created a unit called ""Treasury Division Mumbai"" for re-authorization of most messages sent over SWIFT by branches. The messages include those meant for LOUs, according to a separate circular the bank sent to all its offices on Feb. 12.
""The designated officer at SWIFT Center, Treasury division, will cross-check the credentials of (the) message in Finacle,"" said the note, referencing the lender's core banking software that was allegedly bypassed to pull off the scam, whose scale PNB only disclosed last week. 
Any rejection due to any mismatch will be ""kept on record for audit by auditors"", the note added.
The alleged fraud occurred as one PNB deputy manager, with the assistance of one or more colleagues, issued more than 100 fraudulent LOUs for firms linked to Modi and Choksi.
India's federal police have arrested some half a dozen bank officials, including the two junior Mumbai officials, as well as employees of companies controlled by Modi and Choksi. Lawyers and families of the accused officials have denied any wrongdoing.
The Central Bureau of Investigation says Modi and Choksi left the country last month before the issue came to light.

Since PNB disclosed the fraud last week the bank, auditors and the Reserve Bank of India have been under scrutiny over how they could have failed to detect a scam of such proportions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fears of rising interest rates slammed real estate again on Wednesday after the release of Federal Reserve minutes, making the sector the worst-performing among U.S. equities on the day and the year, but potentially marking a good time to buy.
Fear of rising rates and their impact on real estate investment trusts (REITs) is often misplaced, especially when the economy is growing and not in contraction, an analyst said, reflecting a widely held view in the industry.
""Historically what you've seen is that in rising interest rate environments, if you do see the accompanying accelerating growth, that's actually a point in time where REITs are going to outperform the broader equity index,"" said Laurel Durkay, a portfolio manager at asset manager Cohen & Steers Inc (N:CNS).
Minutes of the Fed's policy meeting in January further cemented expectations that the central bank will raise rates next month and potentially increase its forecast of three hikes this year. 
Investors have shuddered at the prospect, leading REITs <.SPLRCR> to fall 1.8 percent on Wednesday and 9.6 percent this year, the biggest decline of any sector in the S&P 500 index.
When growth and real estate fundamentals are strong, such as now, market corrections driven by rising U.S. Treasury yields have been a good time to buy REITs, according to Cohen & Steers, which oversees $62.1 billion in assets.
The firm found 11 times since the early 1990s in which REITs generated a total return of 16.1 percent on average following a period in which they traded at a discount relative to their property holdings, or their net asset value (NAV).
REITs have traded at a 2.7 percent average premium to their NAV since 1994, Cohen & Steers said. After REITs have traded at a premium for at least six months but then trade at a discount, a year later data show they have outperformed. 
""You've seen time and time again REITs outperform in that scenario,"" Durkay told reporters during a presentation on the relationship between rising rates and REIT underperformance. 
""Only at a point in time when you see rising interest rates and decelerating growth do REITs underperform,"" she said. ""That's a key component.""

1. UK GDP To Revive Sterling’s Rise Against Dollar?
The second reading of fourth quarter UK Gross Domestic product (GDP), is expected to confirm the UK economy grew at 0.5% in the fourth quarter.
The pound has struggled to make a sustained move above $1.4 against the greenback as the latter has rebounded from three-year lows following recent data showing improved US inflation and economic growth. The FOMC minutes Tuesday boosted greenback despite analysts pointing out that the minutes failed to lift expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes.
“The discussion offered limited indication of a Fed turning more preemptive in the face of fiscal stimulus and stronger global growth conditions,” TD Securities said. “This was especially apparent in the Fed's discussion over the neutral rate, where the outlook is little changed.”
GBP/USD fell 0.53% to $1.3922.
2. Energy Information Administration To Report Third-Straight Build in Crude Stockpiles?
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday is expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles rose for a third-straight week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 1.795 million barrels in the week ended Feb 16.
Crude oil futures settled lower on Tuesday as fears over rising US supplies and production weighed.
3. ECB January Meeting Minutes To Halt Euro 3-Day Losing Streak? 
The minutes of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting in January due Thursday is expected to provide investors with an insight into the European central bank’s thinking on monetary policy.
At its January meeting, the European Central Bank left rates unchanged and reaffirmed its decision to make net asset purchases of 30 billion euros from January until the end of September 2018, or beyond if necessary. ECB president Mario Draghi warned that euro volatility creates uncertainty.
EUR/USD fell to a third straight day of losses, ending the session under $1.23."

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 04:19PM ET</span>","Netflix, Amazon win new favor after Wall Street sell-off","By Noel Randewich
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and technology companies poised to benefit from U.S. corporate tax cuts are attracting fresh attention on Wall Street after their shares shrugged off recent market turbulence. 
Amazon on Wednesday rose over 2 percent and touched $1,500 for the first time, while Netflix rose also rose over 2 percent and nearly hit its own record high.
Investors, left nervous after major indexes slumped into correction territory at the start of the month but still confident about the health of the U.S. economy, are doubling down on already popular companies expected to post above-average earnings growth. Many of those are businesses poised to benefit from consumers and companies with more money to spend and invest as a result of U.S. tax cuts enacted this year.
Among such stocks, Amazon has climbed 2.7 percent since the end of January and Netflix has increased 4.9 percent, both outperforming the S&P 500's 3.3 percent decline. 
""Investors are willing to pay a premium for go-go tech stocks that can deliver returns in any environment,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. ""People are going to stay home and eat popcorn and watch movies on Netflix no matter what.""
Analysts on average expect Amazon to increase its adjusted, non-GAAP earnings per share by 82 percent this year. Netflix's earnings per share are expected to more than triple, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
That compares with expectations for S&P 500 aggregate earnings to expand by an unusually strong 19.1 percent in 2018, helped by a tax cuts and a stronger economy, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. 
In terms of their earnings valuations, Amazon and Netflix appear exceptionally expensive compared with most stocks. Amazon recently traded at 155 times earnings expected over the next 12 months, while Netflix traded at 94 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.
As the dust settles from the sell-off earlier this month, investors also remain optimistic about the technology sector. After leading last year's stock market rally, the S&P 500 information technology index in 2018 is in a neck-and-neck lead with consumer discretionary, both about 4.9 percent higher year to date. Amazon is the most heavily weighted stock in the consumer discretionary index and accounted for much of its gain. 
Following earnings growth of 20.5 percent for 2017, the S&P information technology sector is expected by analysts to expand its earnings by another 17.1 percent this year.
Overall S&P 500 earnings grew about 12.8 percent in 2017 and are seen increasing another 17.9 percent this year. 
While analysts have increased their earnings estimates for hundreds of companies to account for new tax cuts, investors still lack a clear picture of how companies will spend their windfalls. Some companies may reinvest it, including spending on technology like cloud computing and cyber security. 
Wedbush trader Joel Kulina said many clients who rode last year's rally in semiconductor stocks are turning to cloud and cybersecurity sellers. 
""Right now, they are the most favored pick in tech, whether it's Salesforce or Workday or IT security names like Proofpoint or New Relic,"" Kulina said. ""People think that no matter what happens, these companies are still going to benefit from more companies spending from the tax cuts."" 
King Lip, chief investment strategist at San Francisco-based Baker Avenue Asset Management, said Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), which sells customer relationship management software, is his top pick in cloud computing, as well as a central technology at his own company. 
""We can't imagine having to change our CRM system. They have built a business that is so sticky that once you are on Salesforce, you're almost not going to ever change,"" Lip said.

1672,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 03:50PM ET</span>",Apple in talks with miners to secure cobalt supplies: sources,"By Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) is talking to major cobalt producers to secure supplies of the material vital for the lithium-ion rechargeable batteries that power its mobile phones, three cobalt industry sources said.
Apple declined to comment.
Locking in cobalt supplies has become a dominant theme as it is also used in batteries to power electric vehicles whose rapid growth is revolutionizing the motor industry, which is also looking to agree long-term supply deals. 
Auto makers, mobile device makers and manufacturers of super-alloys used to make jet engines are all getting jittery about possible scarcities of responsibly sourced cobalt, sources said.
""We're not sure whether (Apple) want to buy the cobalt for the battery makers that supply them or whether they are planning to stand behind the cobalt supply chain as guarantors,"" a cobalt industry source said.
""They've been asking producers to make offers. We're not sure of the volumes, but if they are looking for anything more than a couple of years, they might be disappointed.""
A Bloomberg report, citing an anonymous source, said the iPhone maker was seeking contracts to buy several thousand metric tonnes of cobalt for five years or longer.
Industry sources said Apple had spoken to miners such as  Glencore  (L:GLEN), a top producer, which said late last year it would produce around 39,000 tonnes of cobalt this year. 
Asked on a results call with reporters on Wednesday about the company's relationship with Apple, Glencore's Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg said: ""We have not signed any deals,"" adding that Glencore would not sign any long-term deals because the company did not want to lock in cobalt prices.
Talking to reporters in London last December, Glasenberg said the company had held talks with Apple, Tesla (O:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) as part of ongoing discussions with industrial clients.
Sources told Reuters last year that Germany's Volkswagen had asked producers to submit proposals on supplying cobalt for up to 10 years from 2019.
Cobalt  prices on the London Metal Exchange, at around $80,000 a tonne, have climbed from near $20,000 in January 2016.
Global demand this year is estimated at more than 110,000 tonnes, of which more than 65 percent is expected to come from the Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is a byproduct of copper production. 
Rights group Amnesty International said last year about a fifth of Congo's cobalt production is mined by hand by informal miners including children, often in dangerous conditions. 
""Responsible sourcing has become the be all and end all, especially in the DRC and especially after the Amnesty report,"" a cobalt trading source said.

The DRC is the richest source of cobalt but smaller deposits are also found in countries ranging from Finland to Canada.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dannon Co on Wednesday sued a former high-level sales executive, accusing him of stealing confidential details about the company's strategies and salary data for its employees before jumping to yogurt-making rival Chobani LLC.
According to a complaint filed in federal court in White Plains, New York, Federico Muyshondt stole trade secrets and other proprietary information, including ""roadmaps of Dannon's sales strategies for yogurt sales,"" in the five months before his Jan. 16 resignation.
Muyshondt, of Mount Kisco, New York, had been a senior vice president handling sales in the eastern United States and to supermarket chain  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and resigned four days after receiving a ""substantial six-figure bonus,"" Dannon said.
Muyshondt could not immediately be reached.
Chobani, based in Norwich, New York, is not a defendant. It did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The lawsuit comes as Dannon, a White Plains-based unit of France's  Danone  SA (PA:DANO), tries to recapture sales from Chobani, whose Greek yogurt has made it the top-selling brand in a shrinking $8.8 billion U.S. yogurt market.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against using stolen materials.
Dannon alleged that Muyshondt began preparing for a possible move in August, after attending a seminar featuring Chobani's chief operating officer.
Dannon said he later forwarded details about the company's business plans to a personal email account, downloaded thousands of files, and swapped a SIM card that may have contained contact information for colleagues and customers out of a company-issued iPhone.
Dannon said the stolen information included non-compete agreements for some employees and email addresses for all Dannon employees connected with sales teams Muyshondt oversaw.
""It is inevitable that he will disclose the misappropriated information to Chobani, his new employer,"" Dannon said.
""It would be virtually impossible for Muyshondt to occupy a high-level sales position at a direct competitor of Dannon without relying on the confidential and proprietary information he gained while employed in the same capacity by Dannon,"" it added.

The case is Dannon Co v Muyshondt, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-01567.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to broaden protections for corporate insiders who call out misconduct, ruling they must take claims of wrongdoing to the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to be shielded against retaliation.
The justices ruled 9-0 in favor of Digital Realty Trust Inc, throwing out a lawsuit brought against the California-based real estate trust by a fired former employee who had reported alleged wrongdoing only internally and not to the SEC.
The 2010 Wall Street reform law known as the Dodd-Frank Act is unambiguous in offering no protection from retaliation such as firing or demotion to employees who report claims of securities law violations only in-house, the court ruled.
""The plain-text reading of the statute undoubtedly shields fewer individuals from retaliation than the alternative,"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, writing for the court.
The ruling could inhibit employees from trying to resolve complaints of wrongdoing without involving the SEC and impede retaliation suits filed by workers fired after making in-house complaints.
Whistleblowers not covered under Dodd-Frank still may have protections under another federal law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, but it offers a shorter time frame for filing a whistleblower lawsuit. 
Digital Realty, a publicly traded San Francisco-based company that owns and develops data centers, had appealed a lower court ruling in favor of a fired executive, Paul Somers, after he informed senior management about alleged violations by his supervisor but never reported the matter to the SEC.
The case required the justices to decide who should be considered a whistleblower deserving of protection from corporate retaliation. The Dodd-Frank law explicitly defines whistleblowers as any individual or group of employees who provide ""information relating to a violation of the securities laws"" to the SEC.
""Somers did not provide information 'to the Commission' before his termination ... so he did not qualify as a 'whistleblower,'"" Ginsburg wrote. 
Digital Realty senior vice president of investor relations, John Stewart, said in an email, ""We welcome the court's decision on this important legal issue and the clarity it provides employers."" An attorney for Somers declined to comment. 
Somers, a Digital Realty portfolio-management vice president from 2010 to 2014, sued the company, saying he was dismissed because he reported internally that his supervisor had hidden major cost overruns, eliminated internal controls and granted unsubstantiated payments to friends, according to court filings.
The SEC adopted rules in 2011 to prohibit corporate employers from retaliating against whistleblowers who try to report allegations of securities law violations or fraud.
Backed by President Donald Trump's administration, Somers argued that whistleblower protections must extend to those who speak up internally in order to encourage people to report misconduct without fear of being fired.
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a federal judge's decision that the law covered a wide array of disclosures by whistleblowers, not just those who report to the SEC. Digital Realty appealed that ruling to the high court.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",Wall Street climbs further after Fed minutes; industrials lead,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Wednesday, with the Dow and S&P 500 on track for their seventh gain in eight sessions, buoyed by stocks in economically sensitive areas such as industrials and technology. 
After the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged in January, minutes of that meeting released on Wednesday showed the central bank's rate-setting committee grew more confident in the need to keep raising rates, with most believing that inflation would perk up.
""There was not a whole lot of surprise in the grand scheme of things. It lined up with market expectations for a continued gradual pace in interest rate hikes,"" said Michael Skordeles, U.S. macro strategist at Suntrust Advisory Services in Atlanta.
""The fact that there wasn't a big surprise or revelation was likely calming to the market.""
Expectations for a quarter-point hike at the Fed's next meeting in March are currently 93.5 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. The central bank has forecast three rate hikes in 2018. 
Since inflation worries knocked the S&P 500 down more than 10 percent from its Jan. 26 high, stocks have rebounded in recent sessions as yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury (US10YT=RR) note have stabilized around the 2.9 percent mark.
As inflation concerns have ebbed, names likely to benefit from synchronized global growth have come into favor. Industrials (SPLRCI), up 1.45 percent, were the best performing on the 11 major S&P sectors on Wednesday. Materials (SPLRCM) stocks climbed 1.13 percent. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 218.69 points, or 0.88 percent, to 25,183.44, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 23.55 points, or 0.87 percent, to 2,739.81 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 85.66 points, or 1.18 percent, to 7,319.97.
The prospect of higher rates and an unexpected fall in January U.S. existing home sales dented the real estate <.SPLRCR> sector, off 0.54 percent. 
Qualcomm (O:QCOM) shed 0.52 percent after Broadcom (O:AVGO) lowered its takeover offer for the chipmaker. The revised offer comes in the wake of Qualcomm's sweetened bid for  NXP Semiconductors  (O:NXPI).
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last fell 9/32 in price to yield 2.9262 percent, from 2.893 percent late on Tuesday.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.30-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Mexico's Televisa says studying whether to keep divisions together,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa said on Wednesday that it was considering whether to keep the company intact or to spin off some divisions, as it tries to adapt to a changing media market and shore up advertising.
Like other media companies, Televisa (MX:TLVACPO), Mexico's largest broadcaster by far, is grappling with the rise of online streaming services and suffered a steep drop in advertising revenue last year. The company is assessing whether to keep its business units together or create separate companies, co-Chief Executive Alfonso de Angoitia said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday.
""We are considering all types of scenarios,"" said Angoitia who, along with fellow co-Chief Executive Bernardo Gomez, was promoted to succeed longtime Chief Executive Emilio Azcarraga in January.
""This is basically whether it's good for Televisa but most importantly good to generate value for shareholders to keep all assets under the same umbrella or to create separate public vehicles.""
Angoitia said Televisa was evaluating the approaches taken by U.S. peers such as telecommunications firm AT&T (N:T), which has tried to move into content through an agreement to buy  Time Warner  (N:TWX), and news and film conglomerate Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA), which has sold off significant assets. 
""Even though we now live in a world where media and telecommunications continue to converge from the point of view of customers, there does not seem to be a consensus among our peers... in terms of the right business mix,"" he said. 
Grupo Televisa is also considering spending more on content, Angoitia said.
Shares of Televisa, which owns Mexico's popular ""Las Estrellas"" network and a sizeable stake in U.S. Spanish-language peer Univision, were down 4.66 percent in late morning trading.
Televisa on Tuesday posted a quarterly net profit down 12.5 percent from a year ago, hurt by the declines in advertising.
The company shifted its advertising clients to a new pricing scheme that went into effect this year, intended to help it capitalize on improved ratings.
Televisa has also said that it will shed assets as it doubles down on content and distribution.
Last week, the company announced that it had reached an agreement to sell its 19 percent stake in Imagina, a Spanish media group, for 284 million euros ($350 million).
In addition, Televisa recently sold Editorial Atlantida, an Argentine publishing group, to Luis Castro, an Argentine businessman, according to a person with knowledge of the matter and a statement issued by the union representing Atlantida workers. 
As part of the transaction, Castro agreed to assume Atlantida's debt, according to the source. Castro did not respond to a request for comment. 
Like America Movil (MX:AMXL), the telecommunications firm owned by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, Televisa faces regulatory scrutiny for its high market share in Mexico. 
After a recent Supreme Court decision, Mexico's telecommunications regulator may revisit its decision that Televisa has ""substantial power"" in the market for pay TV, Angoitia said. That decision would require Televisa to take steps to boost competition.

""We believe that one of the probable outcomes will be that the (Federal Telecommunications Institute) will now determine that we do not have substantial market power,"" said Angoitia, noting the company had not been officially notified of the court's decision.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Americans prefer bank branches over mobile apps for opening new accounts,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mobile banking apps keep getting better, but 60 percent of Americans would still rather open a new checking account in person at a bank branch than on a phone, tablet or desktop computer, according to a new survey.
Set for release on Wednesday by consulting firm Novantas, the survey also found that half of U.S. customers feel that online-only banks are ""less legitimate"" than those with branches.
The preference for visits to branch offices over online banking for some activity stems from being able to see someone to resolve any issues that may arise, the researchers found.
""Folks are still hanging onto this comfort of feeling like there is a branch nearby if, and when, they need it,"" said Matthew Sharp of Novantas. Never mind that they are going to branches less often.
The findings show that banks that can afford to keep branch offices still have an advantage over online upstarts when signing new customers for primary accounts.
The results help explain why JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) have said recently they will build branches as they spread into more cities. Bank of America is expanding this year into Pittsburgh. JPMorgan intends to add as many as 400 branches over five years as it moves into cities such as Boston and Washington, D.C. 
The Novantas findings are based on responses from 4,352 people contacted by email in September.
More U.S. customers might be willing to open primary accounts online if traditional banks were able to better show that they can handle problems remotely, Sharp said.
But some banks still will not even change a home address for a customer without a personal visit, said Andrew Hovet, a director at Novantas.
Firms that are newer to taking bank consumer deposits, such as Ally Financial Inc (N:ALLY) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), have had an advantage in being able to design easy-to-use online accounts from the start, Hovet said.
So far online-only firms have mostly signed customers seeking the highest deposit rates for secondary savings accounts, not people setting up primary transaction accounts to anchor their finances, Hovet said.
Still, because Americans, and particularly younger adults, are doing more everyday transactions by phone, JPMorgan and Bank of America can build fewer traditional branches in new territories than would have been needed in the past.

They can open smaller branches, space them further apart and supplement their presence with more ATM kiosks, local marketing and advertising. Done right, they can win, for example, 10 percent of new checking account customers in a market in which they have only 5 percent of the branches, Hovet said.

1691,By Bloomberg,"<span>Feb 21, 2018 01:02PM ET</span>",Too Much is Being Made of the Bearish Bond Data: David Ader,"(Bloomberg View) -- “The sky is falling; the sky is falling!” Substitute “bond prices” for “sky” and you’ll have a sense of the mood in the fixed-income market the last few months.
I won’t diminish the potential bearish impact the swelling U.S. budget deficit will have on the bond market as supply surges in the months and years to come. But we don’t know how much it will affect the market if there is no accompanying increase in inflation and gross domestic product. Still, that hasn’t stopped people from making too much of bearish data, while ignoring a soft underbelly that challenges the bearish narratives. That’s what I’m about to do.
Certainly, five increases in the federal funds rate since December 2015 and the doubling in 10-year Treasury note yields since mid-2016 would constitute a bear market by any measure, but what I suspect is coming is more of a teddy-bear market than a grizzly bear, at least based on recent statistics and hyperbolic stories throughout the press.
First, I’ve read, reread and read yet again articles about the deficit exploding. We knew of that danger well before the tax plan was enacted into law in December. Each report pretty much rehashes the same statistics in an attempt to explain the rise in volatility and interest rates. In reality, few dollars have been added to the deficit projections. When old news is rehashed as new information it can arouse emotions without adding more to the fundamental picture.
Second, there’s the selective use of data events, which I have also used to my advantage. Take the consumer price index. A greater-than-expected increase on Wednesday provoked a sharp selloff in the bond market and was followed by press reports of inflation coming back and, along with a weak retail sales report that same day, led to the term “stagflation” being thrown around.
But here’s the thing: January is a notoriously bad month for inflation. On average, it shows the second-highest monthly increase over the course of a given year and is the highest for the core figure, which excludes food and energy. This particular January had very cold conditions, which may help explain that two of the largest contributors to the gain in the CPI were energy and apparel. In other words, from an historical perspective we can expect month-over-month gains to ease.
Another weather quirk can be seen in the January employment report. While the 200,000 increase in jobs was not too threatening, the surge in wages caught the attention of the bears and is cited along with the CPI report as a reason to dump bonds. It’s not so simple. A lot of people were not at work due to bad weather, and maybe because of the flu, which explains the dip in hours worked. The 0.3 percent gain in average hourly earnings was skewed to a small segment of the workforce, the upper echelon. Production and non-supervisory folks, who account for 80 percent of the workforce, saw a more modest increase of 0.1 percent. These are the people who couldn’t get to work due to bad weather and whose hours worked dipped to 34.3 from 34.5 in December.
It’s also important to understand that the CPI data took a toll on inflation-adjusted earnings. Real average weekly earnings fell 0.8 percent in January, and real average hourly earnings dropped 0.2 percent. That might help explain the weak retail sales data that were largely ignored by the bond market.
Then there’s an empirical measure of sentiment in various forms, price action not being the least of them. One of the best contrarian indicators -- and one that has worked for me for almost 30 years -- is the Daily Sentiment Index. This is a survey of small traders in actively traded futures put out by Network Press. Essentially, the survey asks if you are bullish on a given commodity. When the index falls below 20 percent it means that more than 80 percent of the “market” is bearish. And when the market in question becomes that oversold, it typically marks an inflection point and foreshadows an impending reversal. The DSI for 10-year note futures slid under 12 percent a few days ago and remains a very oversold 14 percent, begging the question of who is left to be bearish.
So is Chicken Little right to run around yelling the sky is falling? At the end of 2017 I wrote that I expected 10-year yields to rise to around 2.85 percent to 2.95 percent, which they’ve done rather earlier than I expected. The evidence suggests yields at those levels provide value, at least in the near term. However, there’s a chance yields could probe the 3 percent to 3.25 percent range at some point toward the middle of the year as the sheer weight of increased issuance spooks both the Fed, due to the added stimulus of the tax plan, and the marketplace that has to buy many more bonds. Yields teasing into that range should be enough to boost the dollar and prove ample competition with a richly valued equity market.
