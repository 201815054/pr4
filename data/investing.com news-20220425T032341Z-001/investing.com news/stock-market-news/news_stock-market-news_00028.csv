1,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",Revenue at airline Avianca falls 51% through early June on coronavirus,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Passenger revenue at Latin America's No. 2 airline, Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p), has fallen 51% for the year as of early June compared with a year ago, the carrier said, in a look into the dire financial toll that the coronavirus has taken on the company. 
Colombia-based Avianca was the first airline in the region to file for bankruptcy protection, after the coronavirus added financial strain to the already weak carrier.
The revenue figure shows just how bad second-quarter results are likely to be for Latin America's airlines. Results published so far only accounted for about two weeks worth of coronavirus lockdowns in late March. For example, Avianca's top rival, LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM), had a drop in revenue of only 7% during the first three months of the year. 
LATAM has also filed for bankruptcy protection
Avianca has not flown any regularly scheduled passenger flights since late March, when its main hubs in Colombia, El Salvador, Ecuador and Peru all shut down at the same time. Those countries remain closed and it is unclear when Avianca will be able to fly again. 
Panama's Copa Holdings (N:CPA) has also not flown any flights since March, when Panama shut down its airspace. Copa's revenue fell about 12% through March. 
Avianca has not yet published its first-quarter results, which the airline said it would release by June 15. The revenue figure was instead disclosed in its annual report filed late last week in the United States with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Avianca did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>","Some Jobs May Not Come Back Post-Pandemic, Adecco Italy CEO Says","(Bloomberg) --
Italy needs to retrain workers and not just protect them if it wants to recover from the possible structural damage done to the labor market by the coronavirus pandemic, said Andrea Malacrida, who heads temporary employment company Adecco’s Italian unit.
Out of a labor force of approximately 23 million in Italy, about 3 million contracts were not renewed, particularly in sectors like tourism, entertainment and similar areas hard hit by the country’s strict lockdown of businesses and people, said Malacrida, whose company has 350 offices across the peninsula.
“It was a bloodbath for temporary contracts,” he said. “Now, the important thing is to move forward, it’s not enough to furlough or give handouts, we need to retrain people, to create new skills and growth to replace the jobs that aren’t coming back. So far, the government has not done enough on this front, and it could come back to haunt us in the future.”
Italy, one of the original epicenters of the virus in Europe, began a regional lockdown in late February before expanding to the whole country in early March. The government started to relax its restrictions from last month. The shuttering of businesses led to a 5.3% decline in gross domestic product in the first quarter, and a far deeper slump is anticipated the three months through June.
“There will be some new jobs available, for example people to manage the new normal with the virus, to take temperatures, to make sure people follow directions, to guarantee logistics in the new environment,” the  Adecco  (SIX:ADEN) Group Italy CEO said. “Some areas are growing like online and of course deliveries of all kinds.”
The Bank of Italy sees the economy shrinking between 9.2% and 13.1% this year, which could swell the country’s massive debt ratio to well over 150%. The government has passed two fiscal stimulus packages since March worth a total 75 billion euros ($85 billion) to support businesses and workers damaged by the pandemic and Italian leaders have acknowledged that more may be needed -- particularly to help keep furlough programs going.
Malacrida says the aid has helped soften the blow but there are many pitfalls, even as he anticipates a bounceback in the workforce.
“There are cases where digitalization has actually reduced the labor force, people have realized that activities done in offices can be done remotely, or that a class of 12 in person can become a class of 50 online, and they are cutting staff, or perhaps they no longer need to rent huge office spaces, they can only rent one floor,” he said. “These are changes that could be lasting.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Fears of a second wave of COVID-19 infections sent jitters across global markets on Monday with stocks and oil under pressure while investors bought into safe havens such as government bonds. 
Several districts of the Chinese capital of Beijing closed schools and ordered people to be tested after an unexpected rise in infections linked to the biggest wholesale food market in Asia. 
This latest development, added to rising infections and hospitalisations in several U.S. states, has led investors to reassess the chances of a swift V-shaped recovery.
""I am convinced that if cases continue to rise again, market participants will clearly re-evaluate market valuations and their assumptions"", said Stephane Ekolo, an equity strategist at TFS Derivatives in London. 
""Market are pricing a too-optimistic recovery, in my opinion, and there could be a reality check coming rather sooner than later.""
After falling over 2.5% in early trading, the pan-European STOXX 600 limited its losses to 0.5% with most sectors and regional markets trading in the red after heavy losses in Asia. 
Japan's Nikkei fell 3.5% and South Korean shares tumbled 4.8%. 
Futures for the S&P 500 pared some losses but were still down 1.8%. 
The retreats follows a global rally since late March, fuelled by central bank and fiscal stimulus and optimism about countries gradually lifting lockdowns.
A number of analysts, however, have warned about a possible disconnect between anticipation of a dire global recession and the optimism in stock markets, with the Nasdaq hitting record highs even as U.S. unemployment has surged. 
""The market was pricing in a V-shape recovery. This can't be the case if there is indeed a second wave, the best scenario is U-shaped"", said Steven Leung, executive director for institutional sales at Uob Kay Hian. 
""There will be a bigger impact this time on all those stocks tied to the expected economic recovery such as travel, hotels, if we see a second wave.""
Euro zone bond yields edged down as investors bought safer assets such as government bonds. 
Germany's 10-year bond yield was near a three-week lows at -0.45%. 
Brent crude futures fell 0.7%, to $38.47 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1.7% at $35.65 a barrel.

Airlines are among the worst hit businesses after widespread lockdowns and travel restrictions to contain the spread of the virus forced the grounding of most of their fleets.
""The aim of the plan is to ensure that SAS is fully funded and that shareholders equity will be at levels reported before the COVID-19 pandemic when anticipated business volumes return to pre-corona levels in 2022,"" SAS said in a statement. 
Sweden, which has a 14.8% stake in the carrier, said it would ask parliament for an injection of up to 5 billion crowns and to increase its stake by an unspecified amount.
Denmark, which has a 14.2% stake, said it would support the recapitalisation but declined to say how much money it would invest. It said the amount ""must be matched by a fair share of ownership"".
SAS said in May it was in talks with shareholders to raise funds. Sweden and Denmark have already guaranteed a 3.3 billion Swedish crown credit facility for the carrier.
SAS said it was also seeking support from the government of Norway, which sold the last of its shares in SAS in 2018.
Shares in SAS were up 3.4% at 1029 GMT.
SAS reported losses before tax for the February-April quarter roughly three times the size of its loss a year earlier.
Sweden said its support was conditional on SAS setting tougher emissions goals as part of its new operating model.

""Let me be clear, Sweden will only go in with capital to SAS if clear, quantitative targets for reduced emissions are set in line with the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degree goal,"" Financial Markets Minister Per Bolund told reporters at a news conference.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>","Hedge funds nurse losses on bets against Greek, Italian shares","By Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - Some hedge funds that bet against a series of Greek and Italian companies are nursing losses after the European Union's breakthrough plan for a 750 billion euro recovery fund sent stock markets surging across southern Europe.
The funds, which include Citadel, Marshall Wace and AKO Capital, still hold short positions on companies such as Italy's Banco BPM (MI:BAMI) and Greece's Piraeus Bank ahead of a June 18-19 EU summit to debate the recovery fund, aimed at helping European economies recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Essentially a bet that the price will fall, shorting involves borrowing shares then selling them in expectation of being able to buy them back cheaper and pocket the difference.
Early last month, shorting Italian and Greek shares may have seemed like a no-brainer; heavily dependent on tourism, their economies are expected to contract 9-13% this year. Italy has also witnessed 34,000 coronavirus deaths.
But the May 18 Franco-German proposal for the recovery fund upended those bets, lifting stock markets across southern Europe. The moves accelerated after the European Central Bank upped the size of its emergency stimulus programme on June 4.
(GRAPHIC - Greek and Italian shares have rallied sharply since May 18: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkplwyryvb/shorts.PNG)
Shares in Banco BPM have climbed 10.8% since May 18, while Monte Dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) is up 25.7%.
Many stocks were off limits to hedge funds before May 18, however, when six European states, including Italy and Greece, scrapped short-selling bans introduced in March.
""Greece and Italy are the main beneficiaries of (the) EU bond and ECB quantitative easing,"" said Louis Gargour, chief investment officer at hedge fund LNG Capital, who was not betting against the two countries.
""The expression 'Don't fight the Fed' can also be extended to 'Don't fight the ECB'.""
Filings with regulators show Marshall Wace and Citadel had each taken out five short bets in Italy; aside from the banks, targets include oil and gas contractor  Saipem  (MI:SPMI) and Italian luxury leather goods company Salvatore Ferragamo (MI:SFER). All have so far worked against the funds.
Hedge funds had 20 outstanding shorts in Italian companies and seven short positions in Greek companies, filings show. 
Those trades could still work, say, if the proposal fails to meet approval from the EU, or if markets are hit by another wave of COVID-19 infections that force economies to lock down again.
""In case of a new coronavirus crisis, economies of Italy, Spain and Greece will be the hardest hit and we will probably be targeted as new markets for shorts,"" said Luca Rubini, managing director at investment firm Fidentiis in Milan.
European short-selling laws require only bets of 0.5% and above of the total number of shares to be disclosed. It is also unclear if all the hedge funds have offset those trades with long positions. 
A spokeswoman for Marshall Wace said the investor was currently net long on Italian and Eurozone banks, net long Italy and had a small net long position in Greece.
London-based Oceanwood Capital Management declared a short position of 0.6% of shares in Greek lender Piraeus Bank (AT:BOPr) on May 21. 
Lansdowne, which has a bet of 2.8% against Piraeus Bank, last month took out bets of 0.9% against Greece's Eurobank Ergasias (AT:EURBr), 1% of  Alpha Bank  (AT:ACBr) and 1.7% of  Public Power  Corporation (AT:DEHr).
Shares in Piraeus, Eurobank Ergasias and Public Power have rallied between 30% and 40% between May 14 and June 12 while Alpha Bank rose 17.7%.

Oceanwood, Lansdowne, AKO Capital and Citadel all declined to comment.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open sharply lower Monday, continuing last week’s selloff, amid fears a second wave of the Covid-19 virus will stunt growth just as the economy starts to recover.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 65 points, or 2.2%, lower, Nasdaq 100 Futures down 159 points, or 1.7%. The Dow Futures contract fell 656 points, or 2.6%. 
Several states in America, including some of the most populous, have reported recent spikes in Covid-19 cases as social distancing measures are eased throughout the country. 
There were also signs over the weekend of a resurgence of cases in China, where the virus was first noted, and in Japan, the second and third largest economies in the world, respectively.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average cash index and S&P 500 lost 5.5% and 4.7% last week, respectively, while the NASDAQ Composite shed 2.3%. All three major equity benchmarks suffered their worst week since March 20.
Of major interest this week will be Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Last week the Fed indicated that it plans years of extraordinary support for an economy facing a long hard recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, with policymakers projecting the economy to shrink 6.5% in 2020 and the unemployment rate to be 9.3% at year’s end.
In corporate news, the oil sector will be in the spotlight after BP (NYSE:BP) said it was taking up to $17.5 billion in charges. The crude giant added the pandemic was having an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period.
Additionally, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) will be in focus after announcing a strategic partnership over the weekend as the big box retailer aims to bolster its position in e-commerce.
Meanwhile, bankrupt car rental firm Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ) filed to issue up to $500 million in common stock in a move that will test the strength of demand from retail investors who have pumped it up in recent days. Hertz stock, which rose from 83c to $5.53 in a matter of days, was indicated down 20% in premarket trading.
Oil prices sold off Monday, as new coronavirus infections add to concerns that a resurgence of the virus could weigh on the recovery of fuel demand.
U.S. crude prices fell 2.2% to $35.47 a barrel, while Brent Futures dropped 1.2% to $38.25.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.4% to $1,713.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1244, down 0.1%.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Charging points surge ahead of electric car boom,"By Christoph Steitz
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The number of publicly accessible charging points for electric vehicles (EV) jumped 60% in 2019, the biggest increase in three years and outpacing sales of battery-powered cars, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).
In its annual Global EV Outlook, the IEA said the number of public slow and fast charging spots reached 862,118 globally, with China, the world's largest car market, taking a 60% share.
Fast chargers accounted for 31% of the total. The IEA defines slow charging as providing power of up to 22 kilowatts (kW), taking hours to charge a vehicle battery. Fast chargers, including Tesla's (O:TSLA) superchargers, can take minutes.
""China continues to lead in the rollout of publicly accessible chargers, particularly fast chargers, which are suited to its dense urban areas with less opportunity for private charging at home,"" the report said.
Graphic: Hooked up, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/jbyprlwbmpe/eikon.png
(For an interactive version of the graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2BVCFMu?eikon=true)
The increase reflects efforts to build critical infrastructure ahead of an expected boom in EV sales, which accounted for just 1% of global car stock last year, according to the IEA.
While most EV charging takes place at home or at work, the rollout of public infrastructure is key to convincing prospective buyers that there is no risk of them getting stranded on an empty battery.
As part of its economic stimulus plan, Germany announced earlier this month that it would provide 500 million euros ($563 million) to support the rollout of private charge points, of which there are 6.5 million worldwide.
""I view this as an organic step in the right direction, but not a revolution with big winners or losers,"" said Thomas Daiber, founder of e-mobility advisory firm Cosmic Cat, of the German plan.
As well as Tesla, charge point providers include Anglo-Dutch group Shell (L:RDSa), France's Engie (PA:ENGIE), Germany's E.ON (DE:EONGn), Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and ChargePoint, whose shareholders include  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), BMW (DE:BMWG) and  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn).

9,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Musk’s Maverick Lawsuit Shield Is Sign of Skyrocketing Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- When Elon Musk said in April he was dropping the insurance policy that protects Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc.’s board from shareholder lawsuits, it got Skip McBride’s attention. 
To McBride, who used to manage law firm Bracewell LLP’s malpractice exposure, Musk’s decision to insure Tesla’s directors out of his own pocket was a first—and a risky move.
But it was also the latest sign that companies are hunting for creative workarounds as rates for directors-and-officers insurance skyrocket amid a surge in lawsuits by plaintiffs seeking to sue as a group. That litigation is now driven by a rash of claims that companies bungled the response to the coronavirus outbreak and the economic lockdown that followed. Prices for D&O coverage are up by almost half and, by one reckoning, are headed for a triple-digit increase.
The galloping rates are “clearly related to litigation over the Covid-19 outbreak and a several-year increase in the number of securities cases against directors and boards,” said McBride, who is now of counsel at the Lanier Law Firm and sits on five boards himself.
“I’m not about to serve on a board where I have to rely on a single individual’s wealth to guarantee I have directors-and-officers coverage,” he added. “There’s just too many unexpected things that can happen.” 
Tesla didn’t respond to emails seeking comment on Musk’s D&O arrangement.
Read More: Greenlight’s Einhorn Doubts Tesla Board’s Independence
Tesla’s board may be expensive to insure, given Musk’s Twitter missteps and run-ins with regulators, and his new insurance setup creates the potential for conflicts of interest. But the burgeoning litigation and higher rates are widespread, and companies are pressing insurance brokers for solutions.
More corporations are inquiring about covering risks to the board by using a “captive insurer,” an entity funded solely by the company and dedicated to indemnifying it against risk, according to Sarah Downey, a D&O specialist at Marsh & McLennan Cos.’ insurance brokerage. She declined to cite examples.
Since February, investors have sued more than a dozen boards of companies ranging from cruise lines to drug makers chasing a coronavirus vaccine, alleging they were asleep at the switch as the crisis decimated their businesses, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
“I think the run to the courthouse has really only just started,” Downey said.
Investors in Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd. sued company directors in March over alleged efforts to downplay the risk the virus posed to customers. Bookers were instructed to tell callers the pathogen “can only survive in cold temperatures,” according to court filings. Norwegian now faces other securities cases targeting directors over its handling of the virus. Its stock is down 65% for the year.
Norwegian didn’t return a call and emails seeking comment.
Plaintiffs filed 428 new securities cases seeking class action status in federal and state courts last year, the most on record and nearly double the average from 1997 to 2018, according to a Cornerstone Research report. Evan Greenberg, chief executive officer of insurance giant Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd., has repeatedly addressed the wave of suits in his annual letter. This year he called “excessive litigation” a “tax on society and business.”
Whether the lawsuits spurred by the pandemic will succeed remains to be seen. A volatile stock market generally translates into more securities class actions, but the breadth of the market’s decline might make it harder to prove it was a company’s response to the virus that caused its travails, Travelers Cos. CEO Alan Schnitzer said in April.

In the meantime, rates on D&O policies in the U.S. rose 44% in the first quarter from a year earlier, with 95% of clients experiencing an increase, according to a report by Marsh. AM Best said last week that the pandemic could push those increases to three digits. 
Covid-19 “will ensure that we will see these kinds of increases for the foreseeable future,” said Ty Childress, an insurance lawyer at Jones Day. 
Tesla officials decided not to renew the D&O coverage “due to disproportionately high premiums quoted by insurance companies,” and Musk personally agreed to “provide coverage equivalent to such a policy for a one-year-period,” according to an April securities filing. Tesla said the board doesn’t expect Musk’s arrangement to threaten the independence of its other members, because the new structure is governed by a binding agreement with Tesla and is intended to replace an ordinary insurance policy.
Not everyone sees it that way. Hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who has long bet against Tesla shares, said last month the structure creates an “obvious conflict of interest” that hinders the board’s ability to “curtail Musk’s behavior.” 
The setup is “dependent on his financial ability to honor his commitment,” Kevin LaCroix, a liability insurance expert at RT ProExec, wrote in his D&O Diary blog in April. He warned that if the economy takes another dive, the directors’ “need for coverage could arise in a set of circumstances that could itself undermine Musk’s ability to honor his commitment.”
It’s a risky board to sit on. In January, Tesla’s insurer paid out $60 million to settle investor claims that directors allowed Musk to dupe the company into overpaying for solar panel maker Solar City. The accord covered all the directors except Musk; his trial is set for July. Musk faces other litigation over controversial tweets about taking Tesla private and rosy predictions about initial production rates for the Model 3 sedan.
Read More: Musk Speaks Frankly on Coronavirus, SpaceX, and Rage Tweets
Captive insurers have their uses, said the Lanier Law Firm’s McBride. Johnson & Johnson, for example, set up Middlesex Assurance Co. in 1970 to address a profusion of exposure, according to securities filings. Over the years, Middlesex has helped cover litigation costs tied to liabilities including those from the company’s talc-based baby powder, which has been blamed for causing cancer. J&J took the talc-based version of the powder off the market last month.
Kim Montagnino, a J&J spokeswoman, declined to comment on whether J&J has used Middlesex to self-insure its coverage for the company's directors, who include former  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). chairman and CEO Charles Prince and former  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET). chairman and CEO Ronald Williams (NYSE:WMB).
Captive insurance is generally trickier with D&O coverage because of potential conflicts of interest, said Marsh’s Downey. The inquiries she’s received haven’t necessarily translated into action, she said.
Musk may be at the leading edge here, as he is in electric cars and space travel, but don’t expect a “stampede,” said McBride, whose five boards include Blue Bell Creameries. “Directors are always going to want to have another pocket of money they can rely on,” he said, “in case their interests and those of the company diverge.”
And if he were invited to join Tesla’s board? First he’d need to cut his own deal with Musk. 
“I’m crafting that agreement, and you can be sure it will be airtight,” he said. “Mr. Musk would have no out when it came to my coverage.”

11,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",BP cuts up to $17.5 billion from assets' value with bleaker oil outlook,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) -  BP  (L:BP) will write off up to $17.5 billion from the value of its assets after cutting its long-term oil and gas price forecasts, betting the COVID-19 crisis will cast a lasting chill on energy demand and accelerate a shift away from fossil fuels. 
Like its rivals, the British oil major is set to take a big hit to revenue from an unprecedented collapse in oil demand due to the pandemic. The impairments are set to raise its debt burden sharply and increase pressure to reduce its dividend.
The move comes as Chief Executive Bernard Looney prepares to outline his strategy in September to ""reinvent"" BP including a reduced focus on oil and gas and a larger renewables business.
BP lowered its benchmark Brent oil price forecasts to an average of $55 a barrel until 2050, down by around 30% from previous assumptions of $70. 
The outlook is the lowest among Europe's top energy companies, according to  Barclays  (LON:BARC) research. See GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/30JYclB
REVIEW OF PROJECTS
BP said that the aftermath of the new coronavirus pandemic would accelerate the transition to a lower-carbon economy, in line with the goals of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.
""We have reset our price outlook to reflect that impact and the likelihood of greater efforts to 'build back better' towards a Paris-consistent world,"" Looney added.
BP shares were down 4.1% at 0912 GMT.
Last week, BP said it would cut about 15% of its workforce in response to the coronavirus crisis and as part of Looney's strategy. 
BP said the new price assumptions will lead to non-cash impairment charges and write-offs in second-quarter earnings, due on Aug 4, in a range of $13 billion to $17.5 billion after tax. It said it would also now review its plans for some oil and gas projects that are at early exploration stages.
BP is set to increasingly shift its fossil fuel production from oil to natural gas, which is expected to play a key role in supplying growing demand for electricity.
However, in its new outlook, BP revised down its assumption for gas from Henry Hub in the United States by 31% to $2.90 per million British thermal units. 
It also increased the assumed price it will have to pay governments for carbon dioxide emitted from its oil and gas activities to $100 per tonne of CO2 in 2030, from $40.
DEBT AND DIVIDEND
The large impairment relates mostly to oil and gas exploration assets and will lower BP's asset value by around 10%, pushing the ratio of equity to debt, known as gearing, to about 48% in the second quarter, RBC Capital Markets said in a note.
At such levels, the company will need to lower its dividend, the bank said.
Investors have increased pressure on oil companies to lower carbon emissions to net zero by the end of the century. BP and its European rivals have in recent months outlined plans to sharply reduce their emissions by 2050, although how exactly they will get there remains unclear. 
Charlie Kronick, senior climate adviser for Greenpeace UK, said BP's price revision was ""long overdue"".
""Accelerating the switch to renewable energy will be vital not only to the climate but to any oil company hoping to survive in a zero carbon future,"" he added.

13,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 05:37AM ET</span>",StockBeat: BP Cuts Admit Big Oil Will Never Have It So Good Again,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The oil and gas industry will never have it as good again.
That’s the takeaway from BP’s announcement Monday, which carried a warning of “between $13 billion and $17.5 billion” in asset writedowns in the second quarter.
The move is the first big action by new chief executive Bernard Looney to bring the company into line with the straitened circumstances of the post-Covid world. It’s unlikely to be the last.
The writedowns reflect that BP (NYSE:BP) expects crude oil prices to be lower for longer because the pandemic will have “an enduring impact on the global economy, with the potential for weaker demand for energy for a sustained period.”
The news pushed BP shares down 4.0% by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT) to a two-week low. They also pulled the FTSE 100 1.4% lower, while the broader drag on oil and gas stocks elsewhere contributed to the STOXX 600 falling 1.1%.
Not only will the world want less energy than BP previously thought, it will also want cleaner energy.
“Management also has a growing expectation that the aftermath of the pandemic will accelerate the pace of transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system, as countries seek to 'build back better' so that their economies will be more resilient in the future,” it said in a statement to the stock exchange.
BP now expects Brent crude to average around $55 a barrel in the medium term, down from a working assumption of $60 previously. It also sees benchmark U.S. natural gas prices at $2.90 per million British thermal units, a level they haven’t seen for 15 months.
The new price forecasts are especially ominous for assets that BP has not yet begun developing. The company is expecting to write up to $10 billion off its exploration intangible assets, or 70% of the value they’re currently held at on the balance sheet.
The obvious corollary of Monday’s announcement is that BP’s operations will be generating less cash in future. That leaves Looney with the hard choice of either selling more and more marginal assets, with long-term consequences for its global clout and capabilities, cutting the group’s dividend.
Taking on ever more debt to keep payouts at their current level – as it did in the last quarter – is not an option if the company believes its own forecasts. BP’s road back to financial health from the Deepwater Horizon disaster has been long and painful, and it’s hard to see Looney throwing all of his predecessor’s good work away by simply hoping for things to improve.
The good news is that that much is already in the price. According to Investing.com data, the stock is currently yielding over 10%. In truth, that merely reflects expectations that the payout will be slashed by more than half, as rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) did at its first-quarter results. Having seen what Shell did, and what BP didn't do, in April, the only surprise is that the market was still surprised by the news."

Futures on the S&P 500 tumbled over 3% and European contracts were down about 2.5% in early trading in London. Asian stocks lost about 2.5%, on track for the worst day since March 23.
China is facing the biggest test of its containment strategy after a spike in cases linked to a vegetable market in the capital. Tokyo, which recently lifted its alert, on Sunday saw a resurgence in cases. Along with the threat of fresh, if localized, lockdowns looms the question of whether policy makers have much stimulus ammunition left in the wake of massive easing earlier this year.
“People are correcting the optimistic view they held,” said Mamoru Shimode, chief strategist at Resona Asset Management in Tokyo. “A V-shaped recovery wasn’t possible in the first place, but people had been quick to buy stocks on optimism.”
Second Wave Tests Near-Consensus on ‘Buy the Dip’: Taking Stock
Risk sentiment got no help from Chinese economic data Monday that showed the world’s second-largest economy had a smaller rebound in May than economists had expected. Retail sales continuing to drop and industrial output rising less than forecast.
Here’s a selection of comments on the state of markets from analysts and investors:
Watch China
“It is reports of new virus cases that suggest caution is appropriate right now,” Patrick Bennett, a strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in Hong Kong, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. “We often say China is an easy touchpoint for markets, whether that be for good or bad news. In the present situation and in wake of a sharp risk-off move in equity markets last week, if China hawkishness is rekindled, markets will continue to trade with an overall negative tone.”
Just a Squall?
The question is whether “Monday’s correction has more legs to it,” Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Investment Funds wrote in a note to clients Monday. So-called value-at-risk gauges, along with the Vix measure of volatility in U.S. stocks “have moved significantly higher, forcing risk reductions across the board.” Lags until execution of those trades means “pressure on markets may last ’till Thursday,” he said.
“Such dislocations are often an opportunity,” Galy said. “We remain constructive on our equity outlook, though it might take a week for markets to calm down.”
Fragile Rally
Takeo Kamai, head of execution services at CLSA Securities Japan:The “selloff may have been triggered by CTAs selling U.S. futures,” he said, referring to Commodity Trading Advisors. It “tells you how fragile the market rally was. But as for today, investors may seem to have their focus on the possible second-wave information out from Beijing and Tokyo.”
‘Robinhood Effect’
Amy Wu Silverman, strategist at RBC Capital Markets, in a note Saturday:
“After a steady climb since late March, last week’s move was a wake-up call for retail and institutional investors alike,” she said of the slide in stocks that featured a near 6% drop on Wall Street Thursday. “Veteran investors have experienced bumpy markets before. How will the newly minted Covid at-home day traders react to the first major hiccup since the late March bottom?”
Silverman said the “Robinhood effect” -- the impact of trading by novice investors over the Robinhood Financial platform -- “has been fascinating and a bit frightening to watch.” She recommended put options on names popular on Robinhood.
Less Bad
Khiem Do, head of greater China investments at Barings in Hong Kong:
“In terms of the impact of these second waves on the global economy and financial markets, while certain geographical areas are likely to be affected, the overall and dominating trend in the coming few months is that the global economic re-opening will continue.” Do pointed to experience that officials have gained in battling the coronavirus for months now.
“Long-term investors should use weak correction periods as an opportunity to add to quality growth-sensitive assets.”

15,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 04:36AM ET</span>","European Stocks Retreat on New Infections, Economic Growth Woes","(Bloomberg) -- European equities extended last week’s slump on investor concerns about the second wave of infections and the pace of economic recovery.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index tumbled 2.4%, having lost 5.7% last week in the worst drop since the March market turmoil. Cyclical sectors such as travel, miners and oil sectors led the declines.
The rally that saw European stocks rise more than 30% from March lows came to a halt last week as Covid-19 cases pick-up in more than 20 U.S. states. Value and cyclical stocks have suffered in particular amid concerns that the economic recovery is slower than forecast. Chinese data Monday showed the world’s second-largest economy had a smaller bounce back in May than expected.
“The air should become thinner in the coming weeks” as “much positive has been priced in and positioning is now less cautious,” said Ulrich Urbahn, head of multi-asset strategy and research at Joh Berenberg Gossler & Co. “However, we still believe that the downside is limited given the huge amount of dry powder and the central bank support.”
Urbahn believes that the cyclical rotation is mostly over as strong macro-economic surprises are most likely coming to an end. His comments echo those of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists led by Mislav Matejka, who closed their recommendation for value and cyclical equities, adding that without value’s participation, broad market indexes could also struggle as the internal breadth narrows. The risk is that activity momentum doesn’t just flatten out, when base effects normalize, but may dip lower again in the second half, they said.
U.S. equity futures also retreated, with the S&P 500 e-mini contracts losing 2.8%.
Some market players, like Sebastian Galy of Nordea Investment Funds, remain optimistic that equities can see another leg up as the U.S. economic growth recovers.
“We remain constructive on our equity outlook,” said Galy, a senior macro strategist. “We would posit a third wave upward in the equity market partially disconnected from fundamentals and driven by the quantitative easing of central banks.”

16,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",H&M says recovery uneven after March-May sales tumble 50%,"By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M (ST:HMb), the world's second-biggest fashion retailer, on Monday reported a sharp but slightly smaller than expected drop in second-quarter sales as measures to slow the COVID-19 pandemic slammed the sector. 
The Swedish company's net sales for the three months to May 31 fell 50% from a year earlier to 28.7 billion crowns ($3.1 billion). Analysts had on average forecast a fall to 27.5 billion, Refinitiv data shows. Online sales jumped 36%.
H&M, which began gradually reopening stores in late April after about 80% were shuttered by the pandemic, said local-currency sales in the first 13 days of June were down 30%.
""The pace of the sales recovery varies largely between markets,"" it said.
H&M, which reports full quarterly earnings on June 26, said 18% of 5,058 stores remain closed temporarily. 
RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain, with a ""sector perform"" rating on H&M, said he remained relatively cautious on the margin and inventory outlook, and predicted sales would keep recovering only gradually. 
""In many markets we expect to see customers preferring to shop locally and more pressure on urban locations more reliant on tourism and people using public transport,"" he said.
H&Ms' biggest rival  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, recorded a 44% sales drop for the February-April period, with constant-currency sales down 34% over June 2-8.
Shares in H&M, which has flagged its first loss in many decades for the second quarter, were down 2% in early trade and 26% so far this year.
Before the pandemic, H&M was well on its way to end a years-long rise in inventories after many stores struggled with digitalisation and tougher competition. 
Chamberlain said inventory had been tightly controlled through the pandemic but he expected it to have risen in May as delayed products from China and Bangladesh arrived in stores.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",Commerzbank preparing to make more job cuts: board member,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) will announce ""considerably"" more branch closures and job cuts when it lays out its strategy review in August, a member of the bank's supervisory board said on Monday.
Stefan Wittmann, who represents labour on the supervisory board and is an official at Germany's Verdi union, also criticized top investor Cerberus's demands for seats on the supervisory board and other changes at Commerzbank, put forward last week.
Cerberus wants two board seats as well as cost cuts and a strategy shift at Germany's second-biggest bank. Commerzbank has already rejected the demand for the board seats.
""Cerberus' approach is rude and inappropriate,"" Wittmann told Reuters.
Commerzbank, which last year announced plans to cut thousands of jobs, is currently in the process of identifying more cost cuts and will announce plans when it releases second quarter earnings in August.
Wittmann gave a sense of what is to be expected. 
""There will be considerably more branch closures and more job losses than previously announced,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment.
Last year the bank said it would cut the number of branches to around 800 from 1,000. It also said it would cut 4,300 jobs in some places but add 2,000 jobs in ""strategic areas"", a net fall of 2,300 full-time positions, equivalent to about 5.7% of its workforce.
Since Cerberus bought a 5% stake in 2017, shares in Commerzbank have fallen about 60% as very low interest rates and tough competition hit the bank's performance. 
The bank, which is still partially owned by the state after a bailout during the last financial crisis, warned last month that its target for turning a profit in 2020 now seems ""very ambitious"" after it made a loss in the first quarter as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic drove up loan loss provisions.
In a letter on Friday to Cerberus, Commerzbank's supervisory board rejected the investor's demands for the board seats.
""We don't have any vacancies,"" Commerzbank's Chairman Stefan Schmittmann said in the letter, seen by Reuters.

The outright rejection of Cerberus' No. 1 demand is expected to further embolden the U.S. investor to continue with its push. A person close to Cerberus said: ""Next steps to come"".

18,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",Analysts' view: Market jitters over second COVID-19 wave are an overdue pullback,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A second straight day of record new coronavirus cases in Beijing and a spike in infections across a swathe of the United States has dented investor sentiment and sent stocks sharply lower on Monday. 
Here are analyst views on the shifting mood related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the outlook from here:
HAO HONG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, BOCOM INTERNATIONAL, HONG KONG:
""You basically now have a situation where, as the countries ease the lockdown, the number of cases will go up. In a market, which was already in the over-bought zone, any news on that front can trigger a sell-off.
""It's unrealistic for the markets to factor in a V-shaped recovery, look at the Chinese numbers today ... retail sales are still down."" 
LEE WON, ANALYST, BOOKOOK SECURITIES, SEOUL:
""The fall is heavier in South Korea today because second-wave concerns added to the escalating of tensions with North Korea. North Korea made it clear its next step will be taken by the military, so there's certainly heightened geopolitical risks.
""More may dump shares in the coming days as second-wave fears in China and the U.S. are clouding the outlook. South Korea may or may not prove resilient again, but certainly more and more are bracing for longer-term uncertainties."" 
JAMES MCGLEW, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CORPORATE STOCKBROKING, ARGONAUT, PERTH:
""This is a healthy correction, but I feel there is some way to go as investors try and quantify what lies ahead.
""The market had run up sharply since hitting a low in March and that was based on a lot of optimism about the economy. But now investors are getting a reality check. Markets are now realising the COVID situation is not under control yet.""
MASARU ISHIBASHI, JOINT GENERAL MANAGER OF TRADING, SUMITOMO MITSUI BANK, TOKYO:
""Markets have ignored the number of new cases and rallied until now because everyone jumped on the economic recovery bandwagon. Now positions are so long that people are more likely to react to negative news, like what is happening in Beijing.
""Another factor to consider is volatility has been rising in some markets, which supports risk-off trades. This means sell currencies, sell stocks and buy bonds. In addition, worries about Brexit are starting to return, and this is not fully priced in. There are more downside risks for financial markets."" 
STEVEN LEUNG, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR INSTITUTIONAL SALES, UOB KAY HIAN, HONG KONG:
""The market was pricing in a V-shape recovery. This can't be the case if there is indeed a second wave, the best scenario is U-shaped. There will be a bigger impact this time on all those stocks tied to the expected economic recovery such as travel, hotel, if we see a second wave.
""These past few trading days, when there were uncertainties around the epidemic, the dollar index has been bouncing back. That means pressure on the Asian currencies. Capital may leave Asia for the U.S., that is negative for Asian markets.""
MOH SIONG SIM, FX ANALYST, BANK OF SINGAPORE:
""Usually after such a long run, there's a pause. There's a lot we don't know about the virus itself, and the market is grappling with that uncertainty. But we are now better prepared. We know what sensible things to do.
""So do we get a double dip? I'm not so sure. I tend to think its a more of a scenario where the recovery might not be as strong as what is hoped for. The market is saying a V-shape, the economy is saying a U and the market is beginning to think it's not a V, it's more of a U.""

19,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 03:54AM ET</span>",Biotech Shares Soaring on Virus Leave Some Investors Skeptical,"(Bloomberg) -- Health-care companies that are trying to develop treatments or vaccines to fight Covid-19 have produced some of the best stock market performances in Europe this year. Odds are, investors will end up disappointed.
The urgent need to tame the virus that has crippled economies worldwide has spurred a flurry of companies to announce research into a vaccine or treatments. Investors have piled into those companies’ stocks, driving four-fold gains in small-caps such as  Tiziana Life Sciences  (NASDAQ:TLSA) Plc and Bergenbio ASA. Many of the companies have taken advantage of the surges to sell new shares.
Government officials are placing most of their hopes in major drugmakers such as AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc and Sanofi (PA:SASY). Investors, though, may be over-estimating the opportunity for smaller companies, according to Daniel Mahony, a health-care fund manager with Polar Capital LLP in London.
“It strikes me that some of them look a little overvalued,” he said of companies trying to develop a vaccine. “When you look at the valuations, what are the implied inputs that some investors are putting in to justify that rise in value?”
One sobering statistic: Only 14% of all drugs in clinical trials eventually win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a 2018 study from the MIT Sloan School of Management showed. Vaccines typically take 10 to 15 years to develop, according to Shore Capital Group Ltd. analyst Adam Barker and about 10% find success once they get into human testing.
Big Pharma companies and their research partners are trying to expedite vaccine development because of the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic. Still, any measurable success remains far from certain, especially for smaller companies that lack the significant resources to conduct big clinical trials. As many as 100 experimental vaccines against the novel coronavirus are being worked on globally.
Hurdles include finding the right immune response and checking for adverse reactions. Safety checks are of particular importance when testing a vaccine, since they are designed to be given to healthy people. The time spent on this stage will be harder to compress than the early ones that have seen rapid progress, according to Barker.
At Cost
And even if a vaccine trial is successful, there aren’t necessarily large profit margins to be found. The U.K.’s AstraZeneca, which is seen as one of the front-runners, plans to supply its vaccine at cost during the pandemic.
“It’s best done by large companies,” Mahony said. “They’re doing it for the greater good of both society and their business. The one reason they’re not doing it for is to make money.”
“By and large it’s a difficult place normally for a small company to play, just because you have to run enormous trials,” he added, noting that big companies also have the advantage of being able to run several programs in parallel -- key when you’re dealing with a largely unknown virus.
Evidence Base
Meanwhile, shares of companies such as Synairgen Plc and Abivax SA have surged following announcements that they are testing treatments for people who fall ill from the virus.
“I’m quite skeptical about most of them,” Barker said. “A virus turning up doesn’t change the chance of the success of a drug. Even though there’s optimism around these drugs, the evidence base isn’t there to support them.”
Those valuations will likely remain inflated until investors are driven away by poor data or are lured elsewhere, Barker said. Valuations based on hopes of a therapy also run the risk of becoming less relevant if a vaccine is found, he added.
Mahony is a bit more optimistic. “I suspect we won’t get a silver bullet therapeutic,” he said, though some drugs could slow down the disease and potentially improve the survival rate.
Here are some of the European companies with skin in the game:
Oxford Biomedica
Cell and gene-therapy company Oxford Biomedica Plc has seen its stock rally 40% since it joined a consortium in April led by the University of Oxford that’s fast-tracking trials of a possible vaccine. Oxford Biomedica will be the manufacturing partner should the tests prove successful. AstraZeneca has since agreed to work with the university group on the shot.
For Oxford Biomedica, “the economics of the collaboration will be meaningful only if the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate is confirmed in clinical trials,” Peel Hunt analyst Amy Walker wrote. An Oxford Biomedica spokeswoman declined to comment on the likelihood of success.
Synairgen
Shares of the U.K. microcap company surged more than 1,100% from the start of the year to a peak in mid-April after it began testing a formulation of the human protein interferon beta to treat respiratory illness in people hospitalized with Covid-19. The shares have retreated since early May, though the company’s market capitalization of about 57 million pounds ($71 million) still towers above its value of 6.4 million pounds at the start of the year.
The Southampton, England-based company had no revenue last year, has no products on the market and has lost money every year but two since going public in 2004.
Synairgen is confident its drug can do “something helpful” for patients with compromised interferon-beta production, who are likely to be those most severely affected by Covid-19, based on previous trails in asthma patients, Chief Executive Officer Richard Marsden said in a telephone interview.
The safety of the medicine is well established and “we know we can switch the defenses on in the lungs with the drug,” he said. The company is still targeting hospital trial data in July, Marsden said.
Abivax
One of the most recent entrants is French biotech company Abivax SA, whose shares have climbed 16% since it announced May 14 that it would begin testing an experimental colitis drug, ABX464, on high-risk Covid-19 patients. The company went on to receive 36 million euros in funding from state-owned investment firm BPIFrance and said May 25 it had also received German regulatory approval for the trial.
The drug has anti-inflammatory and anti-viral action that could make it “a game-changer in Covid-19 therapy,” Goetzpartners Securities Ltd. analyst Chris Redhead wrote in a note to clients last month. However, “uncertainty surrounding the progression of the disease and potential impact of a vaccine makes the opportunity difficult to model,” he said. The project should at least expand partnering and financing opportunities for Abivax in the short term, he said.
Abivax decided to test the drug in Covid-19 because it’s shown anti-inflammatory action and tissue repair in ulcerative colitis, CEO Hartmut Ehrlich said in a telephone interview. “That being said, we are not claiming victory at this stage,” he said. “We are just saying that the scientific rationale to evaluate AVX464 in Covid-19 is strong and that this trial will provide the answer on whether we can slow down the progression of the disease with hyper-inflammation and respiratory distress, or not.”
Bergenbio
Shares of Bergenbio have risen 81% since the Norwegian company’s bemcentinib was selected to be fast-tracked in the U.K. as a potential treatment, with data from the Phase 2 trial expected late in the summer. A failure to show positive results probably would send the stock back to its pre-Covid level, Arctic Securities analyst Pal Falck said in an email. As it’s the first human trial with bemcentinib for Covid-19 treatment, “there are obviously uncertainties whether the pre-clinical effect will translate into clinical benefit,” he said. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Tiziana Life Sciences
Tiziana Life Sciences’ stock spiked 166% on March 11 when the company said it would develop a monoclonal antibody, TZLS-501, for treatment of patients infected with the coronavirus. The drug has the same mechanism of action as two anti-inflammatory medicines, Actemra from Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and Kevzara from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN)., that are being studied in Covid-19. The company raised $10 million through a U.S. equity offering the next day.
Shares quickly returned to their pre-announcement levels until late April, when Tiziana said it was seeking a patent for TZLS-501 in combination with an antiviral treatment as a potential therapy. The company, which had no revenue in 2018 and according to Bloomberg data has no analysts following it, said it hadn’t done any clinical or pre-clinical research into the use of the drugs as a treatment for the virus.
Chairman and founder Gabriele Cerrone and CEO Kunwar Shailubhai have experience bringing drugs to market, having won regulatory approval for three medicines at previous companies, Cerrone said in a telephone interview. “Everything is a long shot, but we’re very focused on the fact that the market is not only vaccine-focused,” he said. “Drug therapies will become more scrutinized and appreciated because there’s going to be a large part of the population which will never get vaccinated.”
The stock has pared some of its gains in June though still remains up more than 100% this year with a market value of about 142 million pounds.
Ose Immuno
Shares of French biotech Ose Immuno surged almost 50% in early May after the company said it was developing a vaccine against the novel coronavirus. The company said it expects first pre-clinical results at the start of the second half of the year and if possible, to begin a clinical trial before the end of 2020. The stock had erased those gains by mid-May and trades back at around 6 euros a share. The company didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded sharply lower Monday, as a jump in reported Covid-19 cases over the weekend prompted fears of a second wave of infections. Losses at  BP  (NYSE:BP) after it took hefty charges also weigh.
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.6% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 2.7%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 2.1%.
Earlier Monday, oil giant BP (LON:BP) said it expects to take up to $17.5 billion of charges in its second-quarter earnings to reflect what it expects will be the ""enduring"" effects of the pandemic, in the form of lower oil prices.
BP stock slumped 5%, dragging the dominant sector and other oil majors lower. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) fell 4%,  ENI  (MI:ENI) dropped 3% and  Total  (PA:TOTF) slipped 3.1%.
Prices had already been on course to open lower after China reported a new outbreak in Beijing’s Xinfadi wholesale food market over the weekend, prompting its closure as well as the locking down of nearby housing districts.
In Japan, Tokyo also reported Sunday its highest number of new cases in around a month, with the majority of cases traced back to recently re-opened nightclubs and bars. 
This all followed a spike in cases in the United States, where more than 25,000 new cases were reported on Saturday.
Stock markets had benefited from a strong rally since late March, fueled by central bank and fiscal stimulus and optimism as countries gradually lifted their lockdown policies put in place to curb the spread of the virus.
Back in Europe, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday in a bid to revive stalled talks on post-Brexit ties. So far there hasn’t been much progress on a free-trade agreement and there’s not much time left to extend the end-2020 deadline for a deal.
In corporate news, easyJet (LON:EZJ) aircraft resumed flights Monday for the first time since March 30, beginning mainly with a small number of domestic U.K. flights after weeks of lockdown. Still, easyJet stock fell 2.7% amid these fears of a second wave of the coronavirus. Scandinavian airline SAS (CSE:SAS) stock rose 3.0% after the governments of Sweden and Denmark indicated they would support a $1.3 billion recapitalization plan. Local rival  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC) fell 15%.
Movie theater operator Cineworld (LON:CINE) will also be in focus after it pulled out of its deal to buy Cineplex, a move that will ease concerns about its debt levels. Cineworld stock fell 1.2%, outperforming the wider market.
Oil prices slumped Monday, extending losses from last week, as new coronavirus infections hit China and the United States, potentially hitting the already fragile recovery in fuel demand.
The oil benchmarks fell about 8% last week, their first weekly declines since April. 
At 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.9% lower at $34.83 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.7% to $37.71.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.7% to $1,725.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1245, down 0.1%.

A strike by workers on the nightshift, which started on Sunday at 2000 GMT, caused the entire production of packaging steel at Tata's IJmuiden plant to come to a standstill, FNV spokesman Roel Berghuis said.
It was the third day of strike actions at IJmuiden since they began on June 10, as employees demand a guarantee that a planned transformation of Tata's European steel activities will not lead to redundancies at Dutch operations.
FNV and other labour unions together represent more than 50% of Tata's 9,000 employees in IJmuiden.

The Dutch unions say Tata is planning to cut 1,000 of 9,000 jobs in the Netherlands as part of a wider restructuring of its British-based European operations. Tata Europe says it does not plan forced redundancies.

24,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>","Intesa, BPER revise terms aiming to avert antitrust hurdles to UBI deal","MILAN (Reuters) - Italian bank  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) has increased the number of branches and amount of assets it will sell to rival BPER (MI:EMII) if its proposed takeover of UBI Banca (MI:UBI) goes through in an effort to overcome antitrust objections to the deal.
In two separate statements on Monday, Intesa and BPER said they had agreed that BPER would buy 532 branches from the combined Intesa-UBI group if the bid succeeds, up from 400-500 under a previous accord.
BPER would in this way acquire an additional 4.5 billion euros ($5.06 billion) in assets from Intesa-UBI, adding a total of 26 billion euros in net client loans through the deal and lowering its impaired loan ratio to 8.4% of total lending.
The price mechanism for the sale, which was revised following the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy to take into account a plunge in the value of financial stocks, has been slightly modified, the two banks said.
BPER said it would pay the lowest amount between a sum equivalent to 0.55 times the core capital of the business it was buying and a value corresponding to 0.78 times the implied multiple paid by Intesa for UBI's core capital.
Previously the latter had been set at 0.80 times, which means that the discount potentially granted to BPER has increased slightly.
Following the preliminary findings from the Italian antitrust authority's review of the deal, Intesa has been racing to submit stepped-up remedies by a deadline set at 0800 GMT on Monday.
The competition regulator, which has taken aim with the BPER deal saying it was surrounded by too much uncertainty, had said the UBI takeover could not be cleared because it would create or strengthen a dominant position for Intesa in several areas.
Intesa in February announced a surprise all-paper offer to take over UBI and create the euro zone's seventh-largest banking group, with a focus on insurance and wealth management.
BPER was assisted by Rothschild & Co, BofA Securities and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) as financial advisers and by Chiomenti Studio Legale as legal adviser.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open sharply lower Monday, as a jump in reported Covid-19 cases in Asia over the weekend prompted fears of a second wave of infections and the potential economic damage this could cause.
At 2 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 3% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 3.3%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 2.1%.
China reported a new outbreak in Beijing’s Xinfadi wholesale food market over the weekend, prompting its closure as well as the locking down of nearby housing districts.
In Japan, Tokyo also reported Sunday its highest number of new cases in around a month, with the majority of cases traced back to recently re-opened nightclubs and bars. 
This all followed a spike in cases in the United States, where more than 25,000 new cases were reported on Saturday.
""Any new outbreak will be looked at very, very cautiously by investors. The market is putting into perspective that the COVID-19 issue has not been resolved yet. It's a reality check,"" said James McGlew, analyst at stockbroker Argonaut, reported by Reuters.
Stock markets had benefited from a strong rally since late March, fueled by central bank and fiscal stimulus and optimism as countries gradually lifted their lockdown policies put in place to curb the spread of the virus.
Economic data out of China earlier Monday did little to improve the mood, with industrial output rising only 4.4% in May from a year ago, while analysts had forecast a gain of 5.0%, and retail sales falling a deeper-than-expected 2.8%.
Back in Europe, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday in a bid to revive stalled talks on post-Brexit ties.

Movie theater operator Cineworld will also be in focus after it pulled out of its deal to buy Cineplex, a move that will ease concerns about its debt levels.
Oil prices slumped Monday, extending losses from last week, as new coronavirus infections hit China and the United States, potentially hitting the already fragile recovery in fuel demand.
The oil benchmarks fell about 8% last week, their first weekly declines since April.

The majority of the park's shopping and dining locations will restart operations with ""controlled capacity,"" while social distancing measures will be implemented in queues, restaurants and other facilities. Hotel services will also resume gradually.
Disinfection will be carried out more frequently and hand sanitizers will be made available for visitors, who will be required to go through temperature screening and wear a face mask. A health declaration will be required as part of the reservation process.

Investing.com – Data released by China on Monday showed a continuous economic recovery in May but missed investor forecasts.

Retail sales fell 2.8%, below projections of a 2% drop but much better than the 7.5% drop in the previous month.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg economists Chang Shu and David Qu warned that a new outbreak in Beijing’s Xinfadi market over the weekend could also stem the recovery, with their note saying, “The new surge in coronavirus cases raises the risk of a second wave of infections, which - depending on the public reaction and the nature of the countermeasures - could hold back the recovery.

China reported a new outbreak in Beijing’s Xinfadi market in the weekend and has since closed the market as well as 11 surrounding districts. It reported 57 new cases on June 13, its highest number since mid-April.
Meanwhile, Tokyo reported 47 cases, its highest number in around a month, with 27 cases traced back to nightclubs and bars. The establishments had recently re-opened after the state of emergency over the city was lifted last month.

China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.01% by 10:33 PM ET (3:33 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.35%, with both reversing earlier losses.
The gains came even after Chinese industrial and retail sales data for May missed investor forecasts prepared by Investing.com, with industrial production increasing 4.4% year-on-year and retail sales declining 2.8% year-on-year and disappointed expectations of recovery signs in the country.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.53%.

The footfall data showed a slight improvement on the 84.7% decline seen in April as some garden centres and homeware shops reopened during May.
Other non-essential stores can open their doors on Monday as long as they are able to comply with social distancing rules.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, keen to see the UK economy start recovering from a coronavirus hammering, said on Sunday he was ""very optimistic"" about stores reopening.
""I think people should shop and shop with confidence but they should of course observe the rules on social distancing and do it safely as well,"" he said after touring the Westfield Stratford City shopping mall in east London.    
BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson cautioned that the reopening of non-essential shops was unlikely to bring immediate relief for retailers who had been under immense pressure for three months.

""A mix of low consumer confidence and limits on the number of people able to enter stores mean that many shops will continue to suffer lower footfall – and lower sales – for some time to come,"" she said.

(Reuters) -  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) said on Monday it will invest 1 billion euros in a fund to invest in climate change projects and reduce to net zero greenhouse gas emissions from all its products by 2039, 11 years ahead of the Paris Agreement deadline.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products company whose brands include Dove soap and Knorr soup, said it was responding to the ""scale and urgency"" of the climate change crisis.
The fund will invest in projects including reforestation, water preservation and carbon sequestration over the next ten years, it said.
The net zero emission target is an extension of efforts already underway to cut emissions within the company by 2030 - such as reducing electricity consumption within offices.
Unilever's total greenhouse gas footprint was around 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019 according to its website. 
""We are now going much wider in our commitments, we call it a cradle to shelf commitment...across the value chain,"" Unilever Chief Supply Chain Officer, Marc Engel said.
Unilever, which has an annual turnover of 52 billion euros ($58.5 billion), said it would prioritise partnerships with suppliers who have set emission reduction targets and has set up a system where suppliers must declare the carbon footprint of goods and services provided. All packaging from 2039 will show the carbon footprint of the product, the company said.
Unilever joins a handful of companies in promising net zero emissions from their supply chain. 
Kit-Kat maker Nestle (S:NESN) and German elevator maker Thyssenkrupp AG (DE:TKAG) are others though their targets are set for 2050, which is the deadline set by the Paris Agreement on climate change to limit global warming to 1.5° degrees.
Unilever on Monday also said that it aims to make all product formulations biodegradable and achieve a deforestation-free supply chain by 2023, among a raft of other moves to fight climate change.

The company said it will use satellite monitoring, geolocation tracking and blockchain among other digital technologies to increase traceability and transparency within its supply chain.

Passengers, who under easyJet's new rules must wear face masks, were to board the airline's first flight from London's Gatwick airport to Glasgow that was due to depart at 0600 GMT. 
The airline is starting with a minimal service, flying mainly routes within Britain to cities including Edinburgh and Belfast. It is also resuming some domestic and international routes from France, Switzerland, Italy and Portugal.
While borders across Europe are being opened, a hoped-for travel recovery in easyJet's home market of Britain has been put at risk by a 14-day quarantine rule for arrivals.
EasyJet, alongside rivals British Airways and Ryanair, started legal action on Friday against the British government's quarantine policy to try to have it overturned.
With no revenues for months, airlines have been cutting costs to try to survive the coronavirus pandemic.
EasyJet said in May it was planning to cut 4,500 jobs, or 30% of its workforce. It has said Britain's quarantine could lead to even more cuts.
Safety measures will be in place to protect customers and staff onboard, easyJet said, with masks plus enhanced cleaning of aircraft and no food service offered.
The airline is planning to ramp up services as the summer progresses and by August has said it will be flying about three-quarters of routes but at a much lower frequency than last year. 

Capacity will be at about 30% of usual in the busy July to September season, easyJet said. Bigger rival Ryanair plans to be flying 40% of capacity by July.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - With glowing blue eyes and trusting feline features, a new robot cat by Chinese startup Elephant Robotics seems happily oblivious to the worries of CEO Joey Song as he shows it off at the company's lab in Shenzhen.
Elephant Robotics' main business is the automation of factory assembly lines but revenue has plunged by a third this year due to the coronavirus, leading the company to cut staff by a fifth.
""It's tough,"" said Song. ""Before, we had more than 30 people.""
Due to the downturn, the firm is putting more energy into the robot cat project funded on Kickstarter in December. Readying its first large batch of 1,000 cats for sale, it hopes that as more consumers work from home, interest in pet robots will grow.
""If the industrial robots can't sell right now, we just focus on other robots to lower the risks,"" Song said.
Interest in robots has surged worldwide as the pandemic forces hospitals, manufacturing and services companies as well as governments to look afresh and with new urgency at ways to minimise human contact.
But in China, months ahead of many countries in reopening its economy and the world's biggest market for industrial robots, new business seems largely limited to robots for warehouses and disinfecting. Most clients are now too spooked by the uncertain business climate to invest in expensive factory gear, industry executives say.
""Automation should be a way to fight virus consequences but on the other side if you want to invest, you need to know the market forecasts,"" said Vincent Bury, managing director at equipment maker CNIM China. ""Nobody has a crystal ball now.""
China's industrial robot sales tumbled by a fifth in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to Shanghai-based consultancy Stieler Enterprise. It predicts second-quarter sales will likely decline 15%.
While the pain is being felt widely, major players in China such as Switzerland's ABB (S:ABBN), Japan's Yaskawa Electric Corp (T:6506) and Germany's  Kuka  AG (DE:KU2G) are expected to weather the storm. 
But for domestic robotic startups that have hitched their prospects to a broad shift within Chinese manufacturing to more automated factory lines, the rest of this year could be make or break. Access to fresh funding is tight as venture capitalists wait to see which firms will survive the immediate downturn.
""We'd love to wait for another one or two months (before investing) to see how they've recovered, whether it's going to get back to normal,"" said the vice president of an investment firm with several interests in China's robotics industry.
He declined to be identified to protect business relationships.
FINGERS CROSSED
For startups that either specialise in or have managed to pivot to cleaning or warehouse-related robots, prospects have become brighter after more than a month of lockdown disrupted China's supply chains and made fulfilling orders tricky.
""We're struggling, luckily struggling,"" said Lawrence Han, chief technology officer at Triooo, a maker of industrial cleaning robots backed by Taiwan's Foxconn (TW:2317) and based in the high-tech hub of Shenzhen. ""I think our product was delayed by almost three months."" 
Triooo is working to clear a backlog of orders and hopes to eventually sell in Western markets where its robots, used in places like hospitals and airports, are more cost effective due to higher labour costs there.
Beijing-based Geek+, a maker of robots that transport and stack goods in warehouses, opened its San Diego office in February just as supply chains in China ground to a halt. After three months of uncertainty, it suddenly saw demand soar as the spread of the virus spurred consumers to shift most of their shopping online, said Mark Messina, chief operating officer of Geek+ Americas.
At Youibot, which specialises in robots for power stations and furnaces, the outbreak prompted the company to develop a robot that can patrol public spaces, scanning body temperatures and emitting a virus-killing ultraviolet light when people are not around. 
The Shenzhen-based startup has found buyers in Italy, Singapore and Turkey, while the American Institute of Minimally Invasive Surgery is also trialling a batch. 
""This product's biggest value to us is that it gives us experience deploying robots overseas and provides us with different ways for our business to develop,"" said Youibot CEO Cody Zhang.

BENGALURU/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian companies went on a debt binge as the COVID-19 crisis slammed the economy, with Canada Inc rushing to the bond market at the heaviest pace in at least a decade.
Corporate bond issuance in Canada between January and May jumped 22.5% to C$78.4 billion ($57.9 billion), according to Reuters calculations, as companies raised funds to safeguard their finances during unprecedented businesses shutdowns.
Cash raised via bonds would make issuers financially more resilient should a second wave of coronavirus infections stall economic recovery. Bonds tend to come due over a longer period than bank loans, adding comfort.
""You don't want to be caught in a situation when you do need the access to capital markets and they're closed off to you,"" said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management.
Helping reassure credit markets, the Bank of Canada cut rates to near zero in March and began its first large-scale bond-buying program.
Some borrowing was pre-funding and some was used to pay down lines of bank credit, said Brad Meiers, head of debt capital markets and syndication at HSBC Securities. If additional liquidity was needed, he explained, companies could then have room to borrow more.
Banks, miners, energy firms, retailers and real estate firms were among those raising debt. The increased borrowing could be a problem for companies facing slowdowns or with high existing debt loads.
Already, the debt-to-equity ratio of private non-financial corporations jumped to 212% in the first quarter, the highest since 2009, official data showed on Friday.
""Leverage ratios are definitely a concern,"" said Benjamin Reitzes, a Canadian rates & macro strategist at BMO Capital Markets. ""There may be a hangover from all this."" 
With the central bank forecasting a further sharp drop in second-quarter GDP, companies could be in for more pain.

Iraq has asked BP (NYSE:BP) Plc to cut crude production at the southern field of Rumaila by 10% as part of the nation’s push to comply with OPEC+ quotas, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private.
The deposit, southwest of the oil hub of Basra, produces almost 1.5 million barrels a day.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners agreed to reduce production by around 10 million barrels daily until at least the the end of July to prop up prices. Iraq provoked the ire of Saudi Arabia and Russia by missing its target in May, when it pumped more than 600,000 barrels a day above its quota of 3.6 million barrels, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

41,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2020 10:50PM ET</span>","Ackman says hedge fund up 27% year to date, dumped Berkshire","BOSTON (Reuters) - William Ackman's hedge fund is boasting double-digit gains at a time many portfolios have sunk along with the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, after the billionaire investor plowed cash into a number of companies he already owned and dumped Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway among other stocks.
The public and private funds at Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management have gained between 22% and 27% this year, handily beating both the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the average hedge fund which are each off 7% since January, Ackman said.
Ackman, who began worrying about the health and market impact of the pandemic months ago, famously hedged his portfolio with a $27 million bet that turned into a $2.7 billion windfall that he reinvested in the stock market in late March, buying bigger stakes in companies he was already betting on.
""We like what we own and we still think these stocks are cheap,"" Ackman told investors on a conference call on Wednesday, adding that his portfolio contains companies whose businesses can withstand unpredictable events with severe consequences.
Positions in Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa), Blackstone Group (N:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (N:PK) were liquidated because the cash could be used more efficiently elsewhere, he said.
Money was used to buy more stock in Agilent Technologies (N:A), Starbucks (O:SBUX), Restaurant Brands International (TO:QSR), Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (N:HLT), he said, arguing these large companies have best-in-class technology to weather the pandemic.
This year's gains come on the heels of last year's 58.1% return, the single best year since Pershing Square's founding in 2004, and signal that Ackman is still having success with his back-to-basics strategy where in 2018, he took back control of making investments instead of being the firm's chief marketer.
Ackman was early in closing down his Manhattan office and sending staff to work from home. When millions of other Americans were told to stay away from the office, Ackman pounced on the beaten-down stock of Lowe's, arguing that the time for long-delayed home improvement projects is now.
""We bought Lowe's at $84 a share and it was the bargain of a lifetime,"" he said with the stock now at $127.62.

In the wake of nationwide protests in the U.S. against police brutality and racial inequality following the killing of George Floyd last month, companies have issued statements in support of the black community and set up funds to fight systemic racism.
The change in policy at both companies comes after a Walmart customer complained the practice of locking up items that cater to people of color was discriminatory.
""We have a firm-nondiscrimination policy that applies to all aspects of our business and our product protection measures have never been based on the race or ethnicity of our customers,"" CVS said in an emailed statement on Friday.
The drugstore chain said it had expanded its selection of products in its textured hair and color cosmetics categories by 35% over the past year to add new brands that appeal to communities of color.

The approval comes against a backdrop of high Sino-U.S. tensions, with disagreements over trade and Beijing's imposition of a national security law for Hong Kong.
The People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) (PBOC) said in a statement Saturday that it had approved the license for Express (NYSE:EXPR) (Hangzhou) Technology Services Co., a joint venture between American Express and LianLian DigiTech Co Ltd. It said the move reflected China's continued opening up of its financial industry.
The PBOC said in January that it had received American Express's application to start operations in China.
In a statement, American Express said it expects to begin processing transactions later this year.
""This approval represents an important step forward in our long-term growth strategy and is an historic moment, not only for American Express but for the continued growth and development of the payments industry in mainland China,"" Stephen J. Squeri, chairman and chief executive officer of American Express, said. 
The PBOC has also approved an application by Mastercard's (N:MA) China joint venture to conduct bank card clearing operations in the country, but the company has not yet received a network clearing license. 
Card giant Visa (N:V) submitted its application in early 2018 and is still awaiting approval.
China is opening its local currency payments market to foreign companies after a decade of lobbying by foreign players seeking direct access to what is expected to soon become the world's biggest bank card market.

The inquiries focus at least in part on how Amazon treats sellers in its online marketplace, the Wall Street Journal and the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) reported on Friday.
Amazon declined to comment on the report of an investigation by California. It was not immediately available for comment outside regular market hours on the Washington review report.
The reports said California state is reviewing Amazon's practices on selling its own products in competition with third-party vendors. Amazon said its in-house products only account for about 1% of its total annual retail sales. 
Washington state is also investigating whether Amazon makes it harder for sellers to list their products on other websites, the NYT reported. The inquiries did not appear to be in advanced stages, the NYT report added, citing sources.
A spokeswoman for the Washington attorney general told the NYT that the office did not confirm or deny investigations. California attorney general's office told the NYT that it does not comment on any pending or potential investigations.
The California and Washington attorney generals were not immediately available when approached by Reuters for comment.
The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee last month called on Chief Executive Jeff Bezos to testify about allegations that Amazon uses data from its own third-party sellers to create competing products.
Amazon is already being investigated by the European Commission for its dual role as a marketplace and as a rival, after complaints from traders.

It may also face EU antitrust charges in the coming weeks over its use of data on merchants with whom it competes on its platform, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing a source.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 11:30PM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors bet bounce in value stocks will stick,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the U.S. economy begins to emerge from the sharp slowdown during the coronavirus pandemic, some fund managers have been drawn to value stocks, a sector that underperformed during the recent rally. 
Value stocks, which typically sport lower price-to-earnings valuations, tended to underperform growth stocks during the bull market that ran for more than a decade and ended this year.
That pattern has recently reasserted itself: The S&P 500 Value index was up just 4.5% over the last month compared to a 5% gain in the S&P 500 Growth index. 
Yet better-than-expected readings on U.S. employment and other indicators have money managers thinking about lightening up on the stocks driving the rally in favor of sectors such as financials and energy. A sustained bounce in these economically sensitive areas could be an encouraging signal for the nascent recovery, investors said. 
The coronavirus pandemic ""reset the economy back to a recession, and now you're in a brand new economic cycle. That typically favors value names,"" said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management.
Ramos has been buying shares of companies he believes will get a boost when consumer spending rebounds, including Sprouts Farmers (NASDAQ:SFM) Market Inc. Shares of the company trade at a trailing price two earnings ratio of 15.5, well below the broad S&P 500's trailing ratio of 22.2. He also owns shares of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc and U.S. supermarket chain Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co.
Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), has been shifting away from technology and healthcare stocks and into financial and energy companies. Technology stocks in the S&P 500 are up nearly 30% since the start of April, while finanical stocks are up 20%. 
""We think they will provide leadership here as the market starts to shift from a risk-off position to more of a risk-on,"" he said. 
Investors will watch a raft of U.S. data next week including retail sales and business inventories for more evidence of an economy on the mend. On Thursday, the S&P 500 notched its biggest daily drop since mid-March after a cautionary economic forecast from the U.S. Federal Reserve and concerns over a possible resurgence of Covid-19.
""We’ve always said that what started with the virus will end with the virus,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management. 
Increased uncertainty over growth or the pandemic's trajectory could push investors back into the growth companies that have delivered performance in recent months, even as the U.S. economy reeled from countrywide shutdowns, she said. 
Despite those concerns, some fund managers who have benefited from the jump in momentum stocks are becoming more cautious, expecting that value will soon regain favor. 

""In the short-term, people have been hiding out in a handful of names,"" said Mike Lippert, portfolio manager of the Baron Opportunity Fund. ""Sooner or later we will get a real economic recovery and from that point the stocks that were thrown out will lead the market.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has finalised new rules for companies looking to list on Shenzhen's ChiNext board, streamlining the listing process and allowing IPO pricing to be fully determined by the market.
Spurred on by the trade war with the United States, China has sought to make it easier for startups, particularly tech firms it sees as strategically important, to gain access to domestic capital and to be less reliant on other venues such as New York and Hong Kong.
The ChiNext reforms are modeled on rules used by Shanghai's Nasdaq-style STAR Market launched last July. Companies wanting to go public will no longer need approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission. 
Instead, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, located in the southern tech hub, will vet applications based on disclosure rules.
There will be no price limits during the first five trading days of a newly listed stock, after which shares will be allowed to rise or fall up to 20% during a trading session，compared with 10% previously.
The new rules allow companies that have yet to turn a profit to list, but the exchange said pre-profit companies would only be allowed to apply after the first year of the reform. Companies with weighted voting rights can also now pursue a listing.

Released on Friday, the documents show the involvement of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) in the December 2018 arrest of Meng Wanzhou, which soured diplomatic ties between Ottawa and Beijing.
Meng is chief financial officer of China tech giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the company at the center of next generation 5G wireless technology and a long-running dispute the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
A CSIS report was disclosed in the court documents as part of Meng's extradition proceedings. In a redacted Dec. 1, 2018 memo, CSIS said it was advised by the U.S. FBI of plans to arrest Meng when she arrived on a flight to Vancouver International Airport later that same day.
""The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,"" CSIS said. ""The planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,"" the report said.
Huawei lawyers called the documents proof that authorities had conspired against Meng.
Meng is accused by U.S. authorities of bank fraud for misleading HSBC (L:HSBA) about Huawei's relationship with a company operating in Iran, putting HSBC at risk of fines and penalties for breaking U.S. sanctions on Tehran.
Meng's lawyers have argued the case should be thrown out because Canada did not have sanctions against Iran. Meng says she is innocent. Last month, a Canadian judge allowed the case to continue, rejecting defense arguments that the U.S. charges against Meng do not constitute crimes in Canada.

The new court documents show the CSIS was concerned about when Meng's arrest might become public. Her lawyers noted the point was of particular interest, since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were attending the G20 summit in Argentina and dining together on the evening of Dec. 1.

Britain's Transport Select Committee said that BA and its parent company IAG (L:ICAG) were trying to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis to cut 12,000 jobs and downgrade the terms and conditions of other employees. 
""It is unacceptable that a company would seek to drive this level of change under the cover of a pandemic,"" Conservative lawmaker Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said in a report published on Saturday. 
In response, a spokeswoman for the airline said:
""We will do everything in our power to ensure that British Airways can survive and sustain the maximum number of jobs consistent with the new reality of a changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy.""
BA is engaged in a battle with unions and in legal action against the government over its quarantine policy, which requires all international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days.
The lawmakers said in the report that quarantine would damage the economy and called for the government to replace it with more targeted measures, such as travel corridors between low-risk countries. 
""It is imperative that the UK Government finds a way to get aviation back on its feet,"" Merriman said.
BA, along with competitor airlines easyJet (L:EZJ) and Ryanair (I:RYA), launched legal action on Friday to try to overturn the quarantine policy. 
All three have announced job cuts, but so far only BA has been singled out for its tactics. 
BA, which is burning through 20 million pounds ($25.2 million) a day and has no revenues, is preparing for what most airlines and travel experts expect to be a smaller travel market after in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Home rental firm Airbnb struck a partnership with Brazil's Sao Paulo state to encourage tourism once the novel coronavirus crisis has passed, a company executive said on Friday.
Virus hotspot Sao Paulo is the first destination in Latin America chosen by Airbnb as part of a global push to revive its business as authorities ease coronavirus-related restrictions on tourism.
""Sao Paulo state is at the core of our Brazil strategy and originates many travelers,"" Airbnb's director of governmental and institutional relations for Latin America, Flávia Matos, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.
Airbnb will have an exclusive page on Sao Paulo state's destinations in its platform and will also share with the local government data and information on what is happening elsewhere in the globe.
""It is likely that most travels will be made by car once the state economy reopens and our platform will provide users with all domestic options available,"" Matos said.
In 2019, Airbnb has had an economic impact of 10.5 billion reais ($2.08 billion) in Brazil, including the entire chain such as restaurants and shops. The company does not break down Sao Paulo numbers.
Brazil's death toll from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, overtook Britain's on Friday to become the second highest in the world after the United States, according to numbers released by the Brazilian Health Ministry.
Brazil has 828,810 confirmed cases with 25,982 new infections in the last 24 hours, and 909 more fatalities, raising the death toll to 41,828.

Early in May, Airbnb announced it would lay off nearly 1,900 employees, or 25% of its workforce, after the coronavirus pandemic led millions of customers to cancel travel plans, hitting the company's revenue.

""We've been trying to get somebody to the table to finally put this behind us,"" First Majestic CEO Keith Neumeyer told Reuters. 
The miner wrote to Canadian ambassador Graeme Clark this week and is hoping to set up a meeting with Lopez Obrador, Neumeyer said. 
The Vancouver-based company, which owns several mines in Mexico, disputes reassessments issued by Mexico's tax authority totaling $209.2 million, filings show.
Lopez Obrador has made cracking down on tax breaks a priority. Several major companies, including the Mexican unit of U.S. retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Mexican conglomerate Femsa, have recently agreed to make tax payments to Mexico.
Neumeyer said the company had proposed three settlement offers since 2018 before launching the trade challenge last month. 
""Each of the offers has been rebuffed,"" he said, declining to provide details.

The tax authority, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria, could not immediately be reached.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), under fire for its strategy and leadership, on Friday rejected demands by top investor Cerberus for two seats on the German bank's supervisory board, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Earlier this week, Cerberus launched a public campaign for change at Germany's second-biggest bank, demanding the seats, as well as cost cuts and a strategy shift.
""We don't have any vacancies,"" said the letter from Commerzbank's chairman Stefan Schmittmann to Cerberus.
The outright rejection of Cerberus' No. 1 demand is expected to further embolden the U.S. investor to continue with its push.
Knowing Commerzbank ""and the people involved, we expected this answer,"" said a person close to Cerberus. ""Next steps to come"".
A spokeswoman for Commerzbank confirmed that it had sent the letter.
In the launch of its campaign this week, Cerberus complained that the bank had failed to heed its advice after more than 70 meetings with managers. Shares in the bank have fallen about 60% since Cerberus bought a 5% stake in 2017.
Cerberus described Commerzbank's performance as ""disastrous"", demanding it appoint two ""highly qualified individuals to be identified by us"" to its supervisory board. 
Schmittmann said in Friday's letter that all shareholder representatives had been elected with an overwhelming majority until 2023. 
""For the time being we therefore don't see neither the necessity nor a basis for a change regarding the composition of the supervisory board,"" Schmittmann wrote. 

The letter said that Cerberus was a ""very important shareholder"" and would have ""ample opportunities"" to offer its input to the bank's leaders.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investment firm Knight Vinke Asset Management on Friday appealed to investors in Swiss energy company Alpiq to block a planned squeezeout transaction which it calls too cheap and threatened to challenge it in court if it passes.
""Should Resolution 9 pass, as is likely, it is our firm intention to challenge the (70 Swiss francs) per share squeezeout valuation in court,"" Eric Knight wrote to shareholders in a letter seen by Reuters.
Oxera Consulting, a firm commissioned by Knight, found errors in the method used to set a value for Alpiq.
""Correcting these errors would result in PwC’s valuation of Alpiq increasing by 50-75%, thereby supporting our view that CSA’s proposed squeeze-out price massively undervalues the Company,"" the letter said.
A representative for Alpiq did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Knight has long criticized plans by Alpiq's controlling investors to acquire the 10% stake they do not yet own, noting outsiders would be deprived of participating in the company's future gains. Besides Knight Vinke, index fund Vanguard and U.S. pension fund California Public Employees Retirement System, known as Calpers, also own stakes. 
Roughly a year ago the Credit Suisse-managed CSA Energy Infrastructure Switzerland fund announced a takeover bid, offering shareholders 70 Swiss francs for each Alpiq share.
Alpiq's shares were delisted late last year from the SIX Swiss Exchange as part of the takeover bid. 
Shareholders will have an opportunity to vote at the annual meeting on June 24.

58,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. senators draft plan to reform new plane design approvals after 737 MAX crashes,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two key U.S. senators are circulating a bipartisan draft bill that would reform how the Federal Aviation Administration certifies new aircraft in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people.
The measure seeks to eliminate the ability of aircraft makers like  Boeing Co . (N:BA) to unduly influence the certification process and marks the most significant step toward reforms following the 2018 and 2019 crashes, which sparked calls to change how the FAA approves new airplanes.
The draft, which was completed this week and reviewed by Reuters, is authored by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, and the top Democrat on the panel, Senator Maria Cantwell.
The FAA, Wicker's office and Boeing declined to comment on the draft bill.
It aims to grant the FAA new power over the long-standing practice of delegating some certification tasks to aircraft manufacturer employees. It would give the agency authority to hire or remove Boeing employees conducting FAA certification tasks and allow the FAA to appoint safety advisers.
One congressional aide said the bill would put the FAA ""back in the driver's seat"" overseeing airplane certification.
Boeing's best-selling plane has been grounded since March 2019 and the manufacturer faces an ongoing criminal probe and investigation by the Transportation Department's inspector general. The largest U.S. planemaker hopes to conduct a key certification test flight late this month as it works to resume flights.
The draft bill would require reforms aimed at preventing ""undue pressure... or instances of perceived regulatory coziness or other failures to maintain independence between the FAA and"" Boeing employees conducting certification tasks.
It would also require regular audits and authorize $150 million over 10 years for new FAA training and to hire specialized personnel to develop technical standards for new technologies and operations.
""Congress needs to make sure aviation safety in the United States is the strongest in the world,"" Cantwell said in a statement to Reuters. ""Strong technical aviation expertise on the ground cannot simply be ignored by senior management at the FAA.""
The Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on Wednesday with FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson to review agency oversight of aircraft certification. Aides hope to release a draft of the bill by then.
MORE OVERSIGHT
An October report by a panel of international air safety regulators raised significant questions over the certification process, finding the FAA had just 45 people in an office overseeing Boeing’s Organization Designation Authority and its 1,500 employees.
For the 737 MAX, the FAA initially delegated 40% of the certification tasks to Boeing, an amount that increased as the five-year review progressed. The panel said FAA involvement in the certification of Boeing's MCAS flight control software, a key safety system faulted in both fatal crashes, ""would likely have resulted in design changes that would have improved safety.” 
The review also found “signs of undue pressure” on Boeing employees performing tasks for the FAA and said they should be able to speak ""without fear of reprisal.""
The draft legislation would ensure no one could prohibit a Boeing employee from talking to the FAA and grant new whistleblower protections to workers at airplane and parts manufacturers. It would also require the FAA to create a new safety reporting system for employees to detail concerns anonymously. 
PILOT BEHAVIOR
The draft bill also addresses concerns about ""human factors,"" saying the FAA must review and potentially modify existing assumptions on how pilots identity and respond to cockpit situations.
A federal review concluded Boeing underestimated the effect a malfunction of new automated software in the aircraft could have on pilots, who were dealing with a cacophony of alerts in both 737 MAX crashes.
When certifying a new aircraft type, the FAA must address the cumulative impact new technologies may have on pilot response, consult outside experts and notify other international regulators and encourage them to make evaluations.
The draft bill was shared with aviation associations, unions and family members of those killed in the fatal Boeing crashes, seeking their input.

Michael Stumo, who lost his daughter, Samya, in the second 737 MAX crash in Ethiopia, praised the draft but called for improvements to ensure the FAA is in charge, especially overseeing ""major hazardous and catastrophic systems"" like MCAS.

Puebla's Governor Miguel Barbosa signed a decree on Friday stating that the conditions for return of the automotive and construction sectors are not favourable, according to a statement published on the state's Twitter account.
Barbosa, an ally of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has said he wants to reopen the state's economy but not if that means people's lives will be at stake.
The Mexican unit of Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) had previously said it was ready to resume operations in Puebla and the state of Guanajuato on June 15. 
Mexico has registered 133,974 official coronavirus cases and 15,944 deaths, though the government says the real number of infections and deaths is significantly higher.
Most Mexican car plants began reopening earlier this month after Lopez Obrador's administration classified operations in carmaking, mining and construction as essential activities from June 1.

The automotive industry represents 3.8% of Mexico's gross domestic product (GDP) and 20.5% of its manufacturing GDP, and directly employs nearly a million Mexicans.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU competition regulators plan to loosen the bloc's state aid rules to make it easier for private investors to team up with EU governments to bail out virus-hit start-ups and small companies, and also to allow aid to firms struggling even before the pandemic.
The European Commission said on Friday it would amend its rules to allow private investors to help recapitalise start-ups and small companies, including those in which the state holds a stake.
It said incentives would be provided to private investors to encourage them to take part and to lighten the burden on state coffers.
A separate change would allow state aid offered to small companies that were hit by the coronavirus to be granted also to those that were in trouble before the virus hit.
""This amendment will effectively increase the possibilities to support start-up companies, especially innovative ones which may be loss-making in their high-growth phase, which are crucial for the economic recovery of the Union,"" the Commission said.

It is now seeking feedback from the 27 EU countries before it decides on a final draft.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago brokers and traders worry the novel coronavirus will kill more of the city's once famous shout-and-gesture trading pits.
CME Group (O:CME), which owns the Chicago Board of Trade, said this week that most of the pits it closed in March because of the pandemic will remain shuttered indefinitely. The news disappointed some brokers who hoped to return to the trading floor this month and are looking for other ways to make money.
McGathey Commodities President Virginia McGathey, who trades in grain options pits, said her income dropped about 90% since the shutdown. Her customers are executing orders for themselves, instead of coming to her, because she can no longer offer an advantage of being on the floor. 
""The powers that be, in my opinion, were moving to try to get the floor closed,"" McGathey said. 
A CME spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the company intends to shut any trading pits permanently.
Open-outcry trading was a raucous tradition in which traders jostled and screamed to execute orders in pits packed with people. CME closed most futures pits in 2015 due to the rise of computerized trading, although more than 20 products like Eurodollar and grain options were still traded in pits.
The Eurodollar options pit will reopen on Aug. 10 with a reconfiguration to allow for social distancing, while all others will stay closed until Chicago and Illinois move into the final stages of their economic reopening plans, CME said. That will not occur until there is a COVID-19 vaccine, a treatment that ensures adequate healthcare capacity or a sustained period without new cases of the virus, according to the state.
CME must be cautious about reopening pits because social distancing is impossible, Chief Executive Terry Duffy told investors last month. 
The London Metal Exchange's open outcry trading floor may also remain closed for many more months because it cannot reopen under social distancing restrictions.
CME has a rule that it will keep pits alive as long as they account for 30% of total trading volume. Eurodollar options are the only product that meets the threshold, Duffy said. 
Floor brokers said health risks appear lower in the grain pits because they are less crowded than Eurodollars. 
CME's shutdown has pushed customers away from complex options trades the pits specialize in, the brokers said. The company said all strategies from the floor are being used electronically.
Agricultural brokerage Futures International will likely scale back its presence on the floor when and if CME reopens pits because floor employees have transitioned well to working in an office, President Gary Sandlund said. 
""The longer that we go without a trading floor, people adapt and get comfortable with a new way of getting things done,"" Sandlund said.

""Sadly it's likely that it's the end of a 180-year era.""

(Reuters) - A Kansas regulatory commission has disclosed that it is considering an investigation into whether power utility Evergy Inc's (N:EVRG) agreement with hedge fund Elliott Management could end up costing consumers. 
The accord with Elliott established a committee within Evergy's board of directors that is exploring whether the company should be sold or implement a significant cost-cutting program. The committee is due to make a recommendation to the company's board by July 30.
Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) staff petitioned the utility regulator to launch a probe into Evergy's ability to provide efficient service at ""just and reasonable rates"" as a result of any transaction the company pursues, according to a Thursday filing.
A commission spokeswoman said on Friday the regulator's leadership will decide on the staff's request as early as next week.
""Staff is very concerned that Elliott's focus on increasing shareholder value will place Evergy's customers at a high risk of paying higher rates or receiving lower quality service in order to support an increase in shareholder value,"" the KCC filing said, laying out questions it wants Evergy's management to answer.
Evergy serves 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri. Its stock was flat on Friday, giving it a market capitalization of $13.8 billion.
An Evergy spokeswoman said the company was reviewing the KCC filing and agreed on the importance of a ""robust and transparent"" process allowing input from all stakeholders. 
Elliott declined to comment.
Should the KCC launch a probe, it would mark the second major intervention in the company's dealmaking in recent years.
Evergy's creation followed a two-year regulatory battle. First announced in 2016 as Great Plains Energy buying  Westar Energy  for $8.6 billion, the transaction was restructured as a merger-of-equals after the KCC objected to how a Great Plains purchase would impact the combined company's finances and customer bills.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU wants to crack down on foreign companies using ""unfair"" state subsidies to acquire EU firms, according to a European Commission proposal seen by Reuters, as part of a strategy to protect its key industries and the single market.
European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who will present the proposal on June 17, outlined her plan in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, saying foreign subsidies risk fragmenting the single market and tilting the level playing field.
""There is an increasing number of incidences in which foreign subsidies appear to have facilitated the acquisition of EU undertakings, influenced other investment decisions or have distorted the market behaviour of their beneficiaries,"" the EU draft said.
It cited the aluminium, steel, semiconductor, shipbuilding and automotive industries as prone to foreign subsidies such as zero-interest loans, unlimited state guarantees, zero-tax agreements or dedicated state funding.
Foreign companies seeking to buy a stake of more than 35% in EU firms which have a turnover of more than 100 million euros would have to inform the Commission if they have received more than 10 million euros in state aid in the past three years. 
Failure to do so could lead to fines or a veto of the deal, and the buyers may have to sell assets to counter any unfair advantage.
The EU proposal also targets companies operating in the bloc and benefiting from foreign subsidies to grow market share or underbid European rivals to gain footholds in strategically important markets or access to critical infrastructure.
Such companies may also have to sell assets, reduce market share or capacity, or make payments to the bloc to rebalance any distortions. 

The EU draft recommends a three-year ban on foreign aided companies taking part in public procurement tenders if they receive unfair foreign subsidies.

Argentina and its biggest bondholders are at loggerheads over plans to restructure $65 billion in foreign debt, with some of the world's biggest asset management companies negotiating with Buenos Aires.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has previously met with Fink, said Argentine President Alberto Fernandez had called him to ask him to speak to the BlackRock (N:BLK) boss and explain Argentina's restructuring proposal.
""He knew I had a good relationship with Larry Fink,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference.
Argentina had been asking for a multi-year halt on bond payments, plus a large reduction in coupon payments.
Fernandez had an idea about how much of the debt Argentina could repay and told him the plan was ""to pay 41% of the debt, a 59% reduction to reach an understanding"", Lopez Obrador added.
The president, describing Fink as a ""good person"", said he spoke to the BlackRock chief to inquire if he was aware of the proposals. Fink responded it was not solely down to him and that he would propose to the board a reduction of 50-55%, he added.
BlackRock declined to comment.
Holders of Argentine debt include asset managers Amundi, Ashmore, BlueBay, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and several hedge funds.
Lopez Obrador said he advised Fernandez that the usual recommendation was to reach a deal that would be convenient for all parties.

The deadline set by the Argentine government to negotiate the debt restructuring is due to expire later on Friday, although this week Fernandez said the deadline for the negotiations would be extended by at least 10 days.

68,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 01:09PM ET</span>",Stock Pickers Are Failing to Beat the Whiplashed Pandemic Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Stock pickers are getting schooled on just how hard it is to outsmart this pandemic-driven market.
After the S&P 500’s biggest plunge since the March madness on Thursday, expectations are rising that shares will move in lockstep again, a headwind for stock pickers looking to divine winners and losers. Add the fact that fewer companies are leading market gains this week, and it’s looking like a tough summer for those who pick securities for a living.
Active managers are coming off a dispiriting stretch. More than 60% of domestic equity funds underperformed the S&P Composite 1500 in the first four months of 2020, according to data this week from S&P Dow Jones Indices. That means investors largely failed to prove their mettle during the most extreme price swings in modern history.
After finding reason for cheer in calmer trading conditions just weeks ago, the question is whether active managers can find overlooked stars and discover securities that sway to their own beat.
“The intra-sectoral correlation is very high again,” said Roger Jones, head of equities at London and Capital Asset Management Ltd. “This normally happens when volatility picks up, when markets are driven more by the top-down than the bottom-up.”
The benchmark U.S. stock gauge pared the early advance in Friday trading, while Wall Street frets a second virus wave and a rally that’s defied the economic downturn.
Anyone with stock-picking smarts has been grappling with virus headlines in a macro-driven market for months now, but lately there’s been reason for optimism. As early as Monday, correlations had dropped to levels last seen before the sell-off, and beaten-up shares were in the midst of a historic comeback. Money was rushing in to chase the rebound as major economies gradually re-opened and U.S. jobs data unexpectedly improved.
Yet on Thursday, pros who had been sounding the alarm over elevated valuations looked prescient, as shares slumped after the Federal Reserve warned of a long path to recovery and infection rates ticked up in parts of the U.S.
The implied correlation of S&P companies spiked to the highest in more than two months, while an equal-weighted version of the index looks set for its second-worst week versus the regular capitalization-weighted version in data going back three decades.
Meanwhile the outlook for small caps looks grim after economic shutdowns across the world. The Russell 2000 Index of small caps is set for its worst week versus the S&P 500 since April.
That’s a problem for active managers who are known to overweight the cohort. The correlation between the outperformance of small caps and the excess returns of active managers has only risen further since the global financial crisis, according to an analysis by Sanford C. Bernstein.
“Given the unprecedentedly abrupt nature of the drop in revenues, it is likely that more small caps will not survive than would be the case in a ‘normal’ recession,” the Bernstein analysts wrote. “The skew to mega cap returns means that managers need to be ever more concentrated in order to outperform.”
The dominance of mega caps is another fly in the ointment. As their stellar returns make the market more concentrated -- just pull up a chart of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). or Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). for evidence -- it’s become hard for stock pickers to have sufficiently large wagers to beat their benchmarks, strategists Alla Harmsworth and Harjaspreet Mand suggested in a note last Friday.
Another challenge for active managers lurks in the underbelly of the stock market beloved by quants.
Factors -- the characteristics of shares tracked by systematic funds -- are driving the largest portion of the S&P 500’s returns in about a decade, Evercore ISI’s calculations show. That suggests that a fund manager picking stocks by slicing and dicing the corporate earnings trends might find their skills overwhelmed by broader forces like a global rush for havens.
Of course, individual managers correctly positioned for market turns have notched stellar returns from the turmoil. And one bull case holds that as easing credit stresses alleviate immediate anxiety over bankruptcies, investors can re-focus on the basics of stock-picking.
Over at London and Capital, Jones’s team tries to take advantage of sell-offs by scooping up stocks with longer-term appeal. But when it comes to a once-in-a-generation pandemic, some humility is in order.
“What confidence do I have in my views? It’s probably not great in terms of all the moving parts in the economy,” he said.

All are listed among the top 11 most-traded names on Robinhood, whose users some have tied to outsize moves in certain stocks recently. 
The bounce was part of a broader equity rebound: The S&P 500 (SPX) was recently up around 1.7%, after notching its worst loss since March the day before. 
Retail investors have grabbed the spotlight in recent months, as markets have rallied in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Some traders and analysts have attributed rallies of between 300% and 500% in stocks of bankrupt or soon-to-be-bankrupt companies such as Hertz (N:HTZ), Chesapeake (N:CHK), Whiting (N:WLL) and JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ) last week to individual investors. The unpredictable moves have left some professionals avoiding the stocks of companies popular on Robinhood. 
Mark Travis, a portfolio manager at Intrepid Capital, has stayed away from airlines and other stocks that appear to have drawn retail buyers. 
""With no sports right now, people have turned to day trading as their new sport,"" he said. ""There's a lot of speculation in the market now."" 
Others, however, have doubts whether retail investors have been a major force in a rally that has seen the S&P 500 climb around 40% from March lows. 

An analysis by  Barclays  (LON:BARC) comparing Robinhood customer holdings to daily returns for S&P 500 constituents found that ""all else equal, more Robinhood customers moving into a stock has corresponded to lower returns, rather than higher,"" the bank said in a recent note.

70,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",European shares edge higher after torrid week of losses,"By Sruthi Shankar and Ambar Warrick
(Reuters) - European shares closed slightly up on Friday after heavy losses in the previous session, but marked their worst week since the peak of the coronavirus sell-off due to persistent concerns over the pace of an economic recovery.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) ended 0.3% higher, after clocking its worst single-day loss since March 23 in the previous session.
The index has lost about 5.7% for the week, with travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) the worst performers as fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections in the United States rattled sentiment. 
Markets had come off three-month highs through the week, with the sell-off intensifying on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve pointed to a long road to economic recovery for the world's largest economy. 
""You have run up for so long, the market is looking for an excuse to pause,"" said Neela Gollapudi, head of portfolio management and research at GenTrust.
""Fed's Powell said we are not going to have a V-shaped recovery, and the markets were priced to perfection in terms of how quickly things are going to turn around."" 
On the day, battered shares of automakers (SXAP), basic resources (SXPP) and real estate companies (SX86P) rose between 1.4% and 2%. 
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa),  BP  (L:BP) and  Total  (PA:TOTF) rose between around 0.6% and 1.7%, despite a drop in oil prices. [O/R]
Data also showed that euro zone industrial output fell the most on record in April as lockdowns halted activity across the region, with analysts pointing to an arduous recovery for the sector.
""As restrictions on industry have been gradually lifted since late April, expectations are that May will be the start of a drawn-out recovery of output,"" wrote Bert Colijn, Senior Economist, Eurozone, at ING. ""It could be a long road ahead before industry reaches output seen at the start of 2020.""
Italian stocks (FTMIB) rose 0.4% on the day. Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said on Friday that the country's economic contraction this year may be slightly worse than the 8% decline currently forecast by the government.
France's Interparfums (PA:IPAR) surged 13.3% after Italy's Moncler (MI:MONC) entered an agreement with the company to start selling perfumes.

Italian infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) gained 3.9% as said it hoped for a positive solution to its row with the transport ministry over its motorway concession. The company swung to a net loss in the first quarter.

72,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 12:27PM ET</span>","USO Oil ETF Gets OK to Issue More Shares, Paves Way for Inflows","(Bloomberg) -- The largest oil exchange traded fund was cleared by U.S. regulators to issue 1 billion new shares, paving the way for renewed investments into the popular retail product that’s been at the center of controversy in recent months.
The Securities and Exchange Commission approval comes nearly 8 weeks after the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) said that it issued all remaining registered shares, a move driven by tremendous interest in the sector as crude prices plunged into negative territory for the first time in history. In that period, it’s been subject to limits from the world’s biggest commodity exchanges, had to find new brokers and even found itself subject to regulatory investigations.
The $4.9 billion ETF, known by its ticker USO, has came under close scrutiny as oil’s rapid plunge forced it to quickly shift some of its giant positions on short notice. While West Texas Intermediate crude is down about 40% so far this year, USO has lost more than 70% of its value, becoming unhinged from tracking just the front-month futures contract due to restrictions from various regulators and brokers.
Both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have opened probes into USO, people familiar with the matter said late last month, examining whether its risks were properly disclosed.

While its ability to accept new money has been halted, United States Commodity Funds, which runs USO, has been actively signing agreements with new brokers, including Marex Spectron and ED&F Man. The moves supplement an existing agreement with RBC Capital Markets, whose risk mitigation measures had stopped the fund from being able to add more exposure.
Throughout April and May, the ETF roiled oil prices after receiving record inflows from investors trying to call the bottom in crude’s rout. Its position in the June WTI contract at one point grew to represent 30% of the total open interest, worrying some about its outsized impact in the market.
The growing scale prompted CME Group Inc. (NASDAQ:CME), the exchange, to instruct it to limit its position in several futures contracts. That forced it to spread its holdings out to different contracts for delivery as far in the future as June 2021, reducing its impact on any single calendar month.
Some of the USO’s stress has also been felt on other similar products after crude’s tumble toward negative $40 a barrel on April 20 forced issuers into a series of unusual steps. The broker for the $500 million Samsung (KS:005930) S&P GSCI Crude Oil ER Futures ETF, for example, in early May restricted any new buying of crude futures. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc forced the $500 million WisdomTree ETP to shut down amid increased scrutiny of how retail investors are punting in the oil market. Others had to delist completely.

73,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",France looks to insure businesses for future pandemics,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's private insurers would provide business-interruption cover of up to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) a year in total for small companies hit by the fallout of any future pandemics, under a system proposed by the industry body.
The proposals, which would not apply to the current crisis, are aimed at helping 2.9 million small and mid-sized companies to cover some losses should they be required by the state to shut down their businesses if disaster strikes again.
The plan follows confusion and recriminations around the world as the COVID-19 pandemic has blindsided governments and insurers. Businesses facing unprecedented lockdowns have struggled to claim back massive losses from an industry that may not be able to cover them.
Insurers in the United States and Europe, facing political pressure and lawsuits from clients, are discussing with authorities new ways to cover future crises.
Existing French business-interruption policies usually cover revenue losses stemming from some physical damage, such as fire. They typically either exclude or do not specifically cover a pandemic.
Under the proposed mechanism, known as CATEX, private insurers and reinsurers would provide coverage of up to 2 billion euros annually to businesses overall, beyond which the state would step in via public reinsurer CCR.
The new guarantee would be built into either fire insurance contracts, which all France companies have; or into business interruption policies, which 50% of businesses have.
The proposal has been put forward by the FFA insurance trade body. It is among plans being examined by a working group set up by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, which includes lawmakers, business lobbies, France's insurance association and public reinsurer CCR.

""The compensation would be a lump sum and paid without prior expertise,"" the FFA said. ""The financing of the CATEX system would be ensured via a premium paid by the companies concerned, and via a public-private partnership.""

74,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 12:00PM ET</span>","After jolt, investors still see stocks as long-term bet","By Kate Duguid and Megan Davies
NEW YORK (Reuters) - An interruption to a searing rally gave a jolt to equity investors who had been getting used to weeks of steadily rising U.S. stocks. 
But long term, even with the rocketing valuations that equities have commanded and the risk of another fall, investors say stocks would still be a winning bet. Underpinning that confidence is the force of unprecedented moves by the Federal Reserve to support the financial system and buy assets, which had propelled some stock indexes to fresh highs.
""If you're a longer-term investor, you still have to like your equities exposure more than fixed-income exposure, where you basically have no upside at this point and your earnings are your paltry yield,"" said Troy Gayeski, Co-CIO of SkyBridge, an alternative investments firm.
Gayeski said if stocks fall a total of 10-15%, he would consider skewing more to equity-centric managers.
Following a sharp rise from March lows, The S&P 500 slumped 5.9% on Thursday, its steepest one-session loss since March 16, after renewed fears of a new wave of coronavirus infections and gloomy economic forecasts from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Prior to the fall, the S&P 500 had traded at 22 times expected earnings, its most expensive level since the dot-com boom. 
Stocks opened sharply higher on Friday.
Still, stocks look more attractive compared to bonds than at any time since the 1950s, with the S&P 500 dividend yield nearly three times the yield on the 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR), analysts at BofA Global Research said in a recent report. 
Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Capital Management said he is not changing his mind on his decision to add riskier assets during the early days of the crisis. 
""We got repositioned in risk assets back in late March, early April so that has helped us,"" said Ablin. ""But we're content to hold for right now.""
Past equity market drops of similar size have not necessarily been a precursor of more declines. The S&P 500 has averaged gains of nearly 19% in the year following one-day declines of 5% or more, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, for some, caution remains. 
Guggenheim Partners global chief investment officer Scott Minerd told CNBC on Thursday that stocks could retest their lows and that the S&P, which closed Thursday at just above 3,000, could nearly halve to 1,600. If the market rallies in coming days, he told CNBC that his biggest challenge will be whether to use the opportunity ""to reduce exposure."" 
David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors, said he sold stocks and raised cash into the rally. He has not committed any cash yet despite the sell-off. 
""I don't want to catch a falling knife,"" he said. 
This week, credit spreads - the premium investors demand to hold riskier debt over safer Treasuries - have widened. The spread of the ICE/BofA investment grade <.MERC0A0> and high yield (MERH0A0) credit indexes widened by 14 basis points and 89 basis points, respectively. Spreads typically widen when the perceived risk of default rises. 
Spreads are still far narrower than during March, when they widened to 11-year highs, but are not yet back to pre-coronavirus levels. 
Monica Erickson, investment grade credit portfolio manager at DoubleLine, said she had lightened up on particularly hard-hit sectors such as travel, energy and real estate investment trusts (REITs) when equities were rallying and spreads tightening. Erickson said she has not changed positioning due to Thursday's market drop. 
""I think there was too much tightening in spreads too quickly and the market is now taking a breather,"" she said. 
William Zox, portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management, said he has been selling fully-valued corporate bonds in favor of higher quality but undervalued bonds such as BBB- and BB-rated regional banks. 
""There is still a massive amount of uncertainty that must be reflected in prices,"" Zox said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An anti-China advocacy group that includes former White House adviser Steve Bannon is calling on the Trump administration to exclude Chinese companies from U.S. financial markets, as the White House studies new ways to crack down on China.
In a letter dated Thursday, The Committee on the Present Danger: China (CPDC) urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to make the move in light of a recent Senate report that found deficient oversight of Chinese state-owned telecoms companies operating in the United States. 
It also comes after U.S. President Donald Trump tasked a working group on financial markets, which includes Mnuchin, with studying U.S.-listed Chinese companies with an eye to protect American investors. China hawks in Washington have raised concerns that U.S. investors in Chinese companies are vulnerable to unforeseen risks because they are not subject to the same auditing and disclosure rules as American companies.
The letter from the group, whose membership also includes hedge fund manager Kyle Bass, notes that the Chinese companies flagged by the Senate report -  China Telecom  Americas (HK:0728) (N:CHA), China Unicom Americas (HK:0762) (N:CHU), and ComNet USA, as well as China Mobile (N:CHL), which was ousted from U.S. consumer markets last year - have tapped U.S. capital markets to help underwrite their allegedly ""malevolent activities.""
The document urges Mnuchin's working group to find that ""Chinese companies may not be listed or traded on U.S. equity and debt exchanges ... unless they conform to all relevant U.S. laws, accounting standards and other financial sector regulations.""
The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Treasury did not respond to a request for comment, but a Treasury Department official who declined to be named acknowledged the letter had been received. 

The letter comes amid growing pressure on Chinese telecoms companies operating in the United States. In April, the U.S. Justice Department and other federal agencies called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke China Telecom (Americas) Corp's authorization to provide international telecommunications services to and from the United States.

The International Trade Commission, in a decision released late Thursday, said Mahindra's Roxor off-road utility vehicle violated the ""trade dress"" of FCA's Jeep Wrangler SUV. The ITC issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting sale or import of the infringing vehicles and parts, as well as a cease and desist order to Mahindra and its North American unit. 
Trade dress consists of the unique characteristics that make a product stand apart and is generally accepted as identified with that product by the public. For example, FCA sees the Jeep Wrangler's boxy body shape, front grille and round headlights as distinct to the brand.
The order is effective immediately, but the U.S. Trade Representative has 60 days to potentially disapprove for policy reasons.
The ITC, which initially opened its investigation in September 2018, had been reviewing an administrative law judge's initial determination from last November. The coronavirus outbreak delayed the ITC's decision.
Mahindra, which previously said FCA's claims were without merit, did not immediately comment on Friday. The Indian automaker previously said it launched its model year 2020 Roxor with what it described as ""significant styling changes"" and would make additional changes if required.
FCA said in a statement on Friday it was pleased with the decision and that the Italian-American automaker reserved further comment while it studied the ruling.
The Roxor is assembled in Auburn Hills, north of Detroit, by Mahindra's North American subsidiary.

Mahindra on Friday reported a quarterly loss and said it planned to give up control of its struggling South Korean unit SsangYong Motor (KS:003620) as it looks to cut costs during the coronavirus pandemic.

Retail receipts in North America fell 36% on a rolling three-month basis, the most since January 2010, the company said in a government filing Friday. Sales in Latin America had the biggest decline since December 2016. Overall global sales dropped by the most since early 2010.
The figures underscore concerns over prospects for a halting recovery at the heavy-equipment maker after coronavirus shutdowns dented the profit outlooks for miners and construction companies. The data comes on the heels of a report that the Deerfield, Illinois-based company is keeping some of its plants across North and South America shut for longer than expected.
BMO Capital Markets analyst Joel Tiss earlier downgraded Caterpillar’s stock to the equivalent of a hold, citing a “catatonic recovery.” Near-term recovery of the company’s end markets will be challenged by customers’ budgetary constraints and stretched government finances, Tiss said.
“These factors will likely overwhelm the myriad internal improvements occurring at the company, at least for the next few years,” Tiss said in the note.
Chief Executive Officer Jim Umpleby took the helm at the start of 2017 with a focus on boosting efficiency and profit margins, and expanding services to help offset the traditionally cyclical nature of the bellwether producer’s markets. In an earnings call in April, Umpleby departed from his normally staid commentary to warn analysts of a “severe and chaotic” impact from the crisis.
Caterpillar’s stock is down about 16% this year. Shares rose more than 2% in New York on Friday morning as the broader equity markets advanced.

78,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 11:09AM ET</span>",Engineers Found Guilty of Stealing Micron Secrets for China,"(Bloomberg) -- A Taiwanese court ruled Friday that current and former engineers from United Microelectronics Corp. stole trade secrets from U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). and shared them with a government-backed mainland Chinese company, closing one chapter of a global dispute that’s stoked U.S.-Chinese tensions.
The district court of Taichung fined UMC NT$100 million ($3.4 million) after finding three engineers guilty of theft or assisting in the alleged theft. The trio was jailed for periods ranging from 4.5 to 6.5 years and fined between NT$4 million and NT$6 million.
The case is part of a years-long dispute spanning two continents that’s deepened divisions between Beijing and Washington. Intellectual property theft is among the Trump administration’s chief complaints as it wages a campaign to contain China that’s rattled global markets. China, which is trying to become a major player in semiconductors, has repeatedly denied that its companies poach trade secrets.
UMC said it will appeal the ruling, saying it has mechanisms to protect its customers’ intellectual property rights and it did not violate trade secrets laws. “In its appeal against the ruling and the excessively disproportionate penalty, UMC will cite many irregularities in both the investigation and the case itself,” the Taiwanese company said in a statement.
Micron welcomed the verdict in a statement and said justice had been served. “The misappropriation of trade secrets and their transfer outside of Taiwan is detrimental to the country’s entire semiconductor industry and threatens future competitiveness. This judgment further reinforces the importance of intellectual property protection in Taiwan, demonstrating that criminal misappropriation will be appropriately addressed,” the company said.
Micron first sued UMC and its Chinese partner -- Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., which is said to have benefited -- in 2017 in the U.S. for stealing trade secrets, setting off the dispute between the top U.S. memory chipmaker and one of Asia’s largest manufacturers of made-to-order semiconductors. In January of the following year, UMC counter-sued in mainland China and that July, a Chinese court banned sales of some Micron chip sales in the country. In November 2018, UMC and Jinhua, along with the three individuals, were indicted in California, charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets from Micron.
Friday’s decision coincides with growing scrutiny of the role that Taiwanese companies play as global leaders in chipmaking and electronics assembly. In May, the U.S. slapped a ban on the sale without approval of silicon made with American gear to Huawei Technologies Co., a move regarded as an attempt to prevent industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. from supplying its top Chinese customer.
“The U.S. is intensifying its scrutiny of Chinese investors and companies and it will not allow Taiwan to become a loophole,” said Carol Lin, a law professor at National Chiao Tung University, speaking before the verdict was announced. She said that Taiwan’s legal process for IP theft cases is long and there is no knowing when this UMC case will be finalized. “This actually may undermine foreign companies’ confidence in Taiwan,” said Lin.
Taichung prosecutors had indicted UMC employees J.T. Ho and Kenny Wang in 2017 on charges of breaching Micron’s trade secrets. Both are former employees of the U.S. chipmaker. Ho and Wang replicated Micron’s DRAM data onto their own devices and used the material for their work at UMC including a partnership project with China’s Fujian Jinhua, prosecutors said in an indictment document reviewed by Bloomberg News.
Wang is no longer with UMC, according to a company spokesman. A third UMC staffer, Rong Leh-tian, instructed Wang to incorporate Micron’s design information into UMC’s own, according to the indictment. The intent of that was to shorten chip development times the court said in Friday’s statement.
In reaching its verdict, the court cited evidence including how Ho was on both UMC’s and Jinhua’s payroll at the same time and it was clear the allegedly stolen technology was intended for use in China.
“J.T. Ho earned two salaries respectively from UMC and Jinhua, so it is very clear he intended to use [Micron data] on mainland China,” the court said in a statement. “Kenny Wang and Rong Leh-Tian both leaked Micron’s trade secrets to UMC for the use of UMC’s relevant business units ... and the final research was to be transferred to Jinhua for mass production, so they had the intention to use [Micron’s data] in mainland China.”
Rong, a senior manager, instructed the other two defendants to wipe any Micron data on their computers before Taiwanese prosecutors raided their workstations, but investigators found a large volume of material from the U.S. company on the devices regardless, according to the court.
The court said Ho had received some NT$5 million from both UMC and Jinhua, while Wang got NT$1.5 million and Rong NT$1.6 million from UMC.
“The defendants’ conduct have led to Micron’s loss of advantage and competitiveness in the market of products connected to the leaked trade secrets and undermined Micron’s interests. This damage is difficult to remedy due to the leak,” the court said in a statement.

The company's shares, which have lost more than a quarter of their value this year, rose 8% in premarket trading.
Like a big portion of corporate America, Dick's had suspended its dividend and share buyback program earlier this year to shore up its cash reserves, as restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus brought brick-and-mortar retail to a virtual standstill.
The sporting goods retailer said it expects to have nearly all its stores reopened by the end of the month and has restored previously cut salaries for all its employees, except certain executives. The company has also returned nearly all its employees from furlough. 

Dick's said it would pay a dividend of $0.3125 per share, unchanged from last quarter, on June 30.

101,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>","As Colombia eyes pensions, market shudders","By Nelson Bocanegra
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's financial market cringed last week when it learned the government was planning to order pension funds to transfer some $7.34 billion worth of contributions to the public retirement fund.
The measure would have allowed 350,000 people with fewer than 10 years before retirement to move funds to the public pension fund, Colpensiones. It immediately sparked speculation the money would be used for some of the $11.7 billion in pension costs the government faces this year, allowing it to redirect other funds toward coronavirus needs.
Although the measure was later ruled out by the government, a proposed law working its way through congress has kept market worries high. 
The law would also allow those with private pensions to voluntarily move to the public fund. The provision is meant to correct legal complaints that savers were not given sufficient advice when they joined private funds two decades ago.
A significant movement out of private pensions would have ripple effects in public bonds, as pension funds are major buyers, and in the stock market, where funds invest a large part of the $71.6 billion they control.
""We ended up in the same place by a different route,"" said Munir Jalil, BTG Pactual's chief economist for the Andean region. ""What it shows is the level of cash flow need... for the national government, which makes them consider these ways of getting funds.""
The country's economy, usually one of the region's heartiest, looks set to contract 5.5% this year because of a months-long coronavirus quarantine and lower oil prices.
""These proposals don't help at all because we'd have to calculate how much money would leave private funds,"" said Daniel Velandia, Credicorp (NYSE:BAP) Capital's chief Colombian economist. ""They would have to sell their positions or transfer debt titles to the government; it isn't at all a positive impact.""
The policy has echoes of Argentina in 2008, analysts said, when private pensions were nationalized to make $24 billion available to the government.
Bogota's ""fortunate reversal"" kept Colombia off Argentina's ""disastrous path,"" former Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo said on Twitter.
The government was considering allowing partial withdrawals from pension funds, Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla said on Wednesday. A day later, President Ivan Duque rejected the idea. 
""This shows the deficiencies of the system and makes the need for a structural pension reform even more urgent,"" said Mauricio Olivera, director at the Econometria consultancy. ""If everyone moves to Colpensiones, it could create a pension time bomb because the subsidies are really high.""

102,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",Indian automaker Mahindra seeks to give up control of struggling unit SsangYong,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) -  Mahindra & Mahindra  (NS:MAHM) plans to give up control of struggling South Korean unit SsangYong Motor (KS:003620), the Indian automaker's managing director said on Friday, as it looks to exit loss-making ventures amid the coronavirus pandemic.
""SsangYong needs a new investor. We are working with the company to see if we can secure investment,"" Pawan Goenka told reporters.
Mahindra earlier reported a consolidated net loss of 19.55 billion rupees ($258 million), compared with a net profit a year ago, as it booked a writedown on its investment in SsangYong and other international units.
Mahindra, which owns a 75% stake in SsangYong, rescued the sport-utility vehicle (SUV) maker from near-insolvency in 2010 but has struggled to revive its fortunes. The company said in April it would not invest further in SsangYong.
""If a new investor comes on board, that automatically takes our stake down, or they may even buy our stake,"" Mahindra's deputy managing director, Anish Shah said.
As part of a wider restructuring effort by the company to cut costs and prioritise capital expenditure as it rides out the coronavirus pandemic, Mahindra would review all its loss-making businesses over the next 12 months, Shah said.
Where there is no clear path to profitability it would look for a partnership or close down those businesses, but in those that can clearly generate equity returns of 18% or those that are of strategic importance, Mahindra would continue to invest, Shah said.
Mahindra, which entered into a joint venture with U.S. automaker Ford Motor (N:F) last year, said the pandemic had delayed the completion of merger formalities between the two companies but they continued to work together under the new alliance.

103,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",U.S. manufacturers struggle to keep workers in face of weak demand,"By Timothy Aeppel and Rajesh Kumar Singh
(Reuters) - Cheryl Wellman was able to bring back most of her furloughed workers last month with the help of a special government loan.
Now she's laying them off again.
Wellman, president of Integrity Metals LLC in Romeoville, Illinois, which makes metal parts for big companies including  General Electric  Co. (N:GE) and Honeywell International Inc. (N:HON), was hoping for a surge of orders as the pandemic shutdowns lifted and companies moved to restock shelves. She also hoped the disruptions of recent months would pull more businesses back to U.S. shores, creating new opportunities for smaller suppliers like Integrity, which has 20 employees. But neither of those things has happened yet, she said.
Integrity was able to rehire with the aid of just over $200,000 from the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, which offers forgivable government-backed loans. The Small Business Administration has approved 4.5 million of these loans averaging $113,000 in size for a total of $512 billion as of June 10.
Some of the strength in the U.S. payrolls report for May - which included a startling 225,000 manufacturing jobs added - was the result of companies taking part in this program.
The problem now is that demand in many industrial sectors, from oil and gas to construction equipment, remains depressed, and that underscores the subdued response key policymakers such as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have shown over the big upsurge in hiring in May.
""It is a long road. It is going to take some time,"" Powell said in a press conference on Wednesday after the Fed's latest meeting, cautioning that while encouraging, the surprise 2.5 million jump in jobs in May remains a single data point for now. Data on Thursday showed more than 20 million people remain on unemployment benefits even as new claims fell for a 10th straight week.
FULL RECOVERY YEARS AWAY
To be sure, some U.S. factories are booming. 
Detroit is rushing to build trucks and SUVs, for instance. And Polaris Inc. (N:PII), the maker of all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, recorded record sales in April and May, CEO Scott Wine told Reuters. ""All our plants are running at full capacity,"" he said.
Chad Moutray, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, said he thinks the worst of the downturn is behind us, but that demand will remain weak as companies fret about the potential for another virus surge and the political uncertainty of an election year. ""I don’t see us getting back to pre-recession levels of output until 2022,"" he said.
He notes that while manufacturers added an impressive number of jobs for a single month in May, the sector is still down 1.1 million jobs from its pre-crisis level in February.
The impact is most visible in some of America's biggest industrial names. Both  Caterpillar  Inc. (N:CAT) and  Deere & Co . (N:DE) are expected to see about a 30% drop in revenues in the current quarter, compared to a year ago, according to analysts. Both companies have curtailed work at U.S. factories.
This filters out through the economy as companies conserve cash by cutting costs and capital spending. Weaker demand for machinery means less demand for basic metals and electronic components. U.S. Steel Corp. (N:X) has idled 4.5 million net tons of flat-rolled and 1.9 million net tons of tubular steel capacity. Similarly, miners have slashed their 2020 capex estimates by 20%.
One business that sits at the foundation of many supply chains is metal foundries like Bremen Castings Inc., in Bremen, Indiana, which cranks out castings used in an array of industrial and transportation equipment. 
Bremen used its PPP loan to keep its workers on the job through the shutdowns. Even as business wilted, its workers continued to get paid for full-time work.
They won't be so lucky in the months ahead.
""We see weakness across the board in all our markets,"" said J.B. Brown, president of the family-owned business. The company's workforce has shrunk over the past two months, down 18% from 245 to 202 workers, through attrition. The company didn't replace people who left or were fired.

But this Friday, Brown plans to post a sign in the factory, warning workers that they will soon face reduced shifts, due to the lack of work. They'll be able to apply to a program offered in Indiana that allows workers to make up for lost wages.

The brokerages, while reiterating that their long-term view on the stock remains positive, noted the current valuation underestimates risks including increased competition in the electric vehicle industry.
Top automakers including General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) have doubled down on their investments in the space by offering more electric vehicles, aiming to cash in on a sector that is touted as the most promising alternative to conventional cars.
""We highlight risks to Sino-U.S. trade, near-term demand, capital needs and tech competition as the key bear vectors we think deserve more attention,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note on Friday.
Morgan Stanley cut its rating to ""under-weight"", joining 12 other brokerages who recommend selling the stock.
Following Goldman Sachs' downgrade to ""neutral"", Tesla now has 12 analysts with a ""hold"" rating, and nine brokerages recommending ""buy"" or higher.
The bar for the automaker's fundamentals is higher, Goldman analyst Mark Delaney said on Thursday, while increasing the price target to $950 from $925.
Morgan Stanley cut its price target on Tesla's stock to $650 from $680, in line with the median price target, according to Refinitiv data.

Tesla's shares, which have jumped a whopping 360% in the last twelve months, were down nearly 1% in premarket trading.

MOSCOW/FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Russian steelmaker Severstal (MM:CHMF) has no plans to get involved in industry consolidation in Europe, its finance chief said, effectively narrowing a list of potential partners for Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG).
Thyssenkrupp said last month it could put its steel unit, Europe's second-largest, on the block, prompting investment banks and law firms to jostle for a role in the expected shakeout, people familiar with the matter said. 
India's  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) is also looking to sell its European division, the people said, adding its struggling Port Talbot plant in Britain needed 500 million pounds ($632 million) in state aid.
Meanwhile, industry-leader ArcelorMittal (AS:MT) has run into trouble with the purchase of Italy's Ilva plant.
""We have not considered the cases,"" Severstal's CFO Alexey Kulichenko told Reuters when asked whether the group had received proposals from the three firms. ""Europe today does not look like an attractive option.""
Severstal has no plans for any big mergers or acquisitions but remains mindful of market opportunities, he added.
Hit by oversupply, a struggling car sector and cheap Chinese imports, Europe's steel industry was already struggling to make a profit before the coronavirus pandemic worsened conditions. 
A tie-up between Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel in Europe could materialise quickly, the people said, pointing to their long relationship that was dealt a blow last year when a planned joint venture was blocked by Brussels on antitrust grounds.
Regulatory concerns are also seen as a hurdle to any deal in Europe, including with Sweden's SSAB (ST:SSABa) and Germany's  Salzgitter  (DE:SZGG), which has said it would look at consolidation proposals if they made sense.
While Thyssenkrupp is also in talks with China's Baoshan Iron & Steel (Baosteel) (SS:600019), involvement of Asian players is certain to draw political opposition, the sources said.
Thyssenkrupp could even revive plans for an initial public offering for the unit -- which made a 498 million euros ($564 million) first-half operating loss -- once the market recovers, they added.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment and referred to comments made by CEO Martina Merz last month, saying nothing was off-limits with regard to the steel division.

Baosteel declined to comment. Tata Steel and SSAB did not respond to requests for comments.

""Richemont announces that Sophie Guieysse is stepping down from the senior executive committee with immediate effect, and will not stand for re-election to the board of directors at the annual general meeting on 9 September 2020,"" it said in a statement that gave no more details.
A source close to the company said Guieysse was still in her HR post but no longer on the senior committee. 
Richemont - which also makes Piaget, IWC and Vacheron Constantin watches - had said a week ago it was reviewing its human resources function and could make a change.
The abrupt switch is another headache for Richemont, which has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic and as employee anger over pay issues mounts.
Richemont announced strict cost-cutting measures including pay and bonus cuts for staff in May, but its annual report revealed that compensation for its top executives, including Guieysse, rose by about a third for the fiscal year to March, causing irritation among staff, sources told Reuters. 
The group had already undergone a management reshuffle at the time of Guieysse's appointment in 2017, with the replacement of almost all its brand heads and surprise departure of potential CEO candidate Georges Kern to competitor Breitling.
Guieysse's appointment was seen as an attempt to bring back stability, but more high-profile departures followed. 
Chief Technology Officer Jean-Jacques Van Oosten left in May 2018 after just four months on the job, and Eric Vallat decided to return to his previous employer in 2019 after trying for a year to fix Richemont's fashion and accessory business.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank's (T:9984) share buybacks slowed in May, a company filing showed on Friday, although total purchases to support its share price since March reached 312 billion yen ($2.9 billion).
The buybacks, funded by a major asset sale programme, are part of a record up to 2.5 trillion yen undertaking by SoftBank, which spent 61 billion yen buying back its shares in May, compared with 235 billion yen in April.

""Market sentiment was strong for its underlying holdings so SoftBank may have decided to keep some powder dry,"" said Kirk Boodry, analyst at Redex Research. 
SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is trying to stabilise the group, which has been hit by underperformance at some of its biggest technology investments.
The group's earnings were reported in May, where its $100 billion Vision Fund reported a 1.9 trillion yen operating shortfall, pushing SoftBank to a record full year loss. 
The company's buybacks have caused concern at credit rating agencies, with S&P Global Ratings saying on Thursday it puts SoftBank's financial rigour in question.
SoftBank's shares, which have gained around 90% from their March lows, closed down 2.2% on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways, easyJet (L:EZJ) and Ryanair (I:RYA) said on Friday they have begun legal action against the British government's quarantine policy in a bid to overturn what they see as overly strict rules. 
All three airlines had hoped to resume regular flights after air travel came to a total standstill during the coronavirus pandemic, leading to almost 20,000 job losses between them. 
But Britain's 14-day quarantine, introduced on June 8 for arrivals from abroad, is deterring bookings at a time when other European countries are beginning to open their borders. 
The airlines said in a statement issued by BA's parent company IAG (L:ICAG) they had lodged their complaint with the High Court, asking for a judicial review as soon as possible. 
If judges agree, lawyers have said the government would have to show the scientific evidence that underpinned the rule.
There was no immediate response from the British government, which has previously defended quarantine as necessary to prevent a second wave of the coronavirus.
Britain's chief scientist said earlier in June that politicians decided the policy, adding quarantines worked best for restricting travel from countries with high infection rates.
The airlines said there was no scientific evidence for the policy and there had been no consultation with the industry on the new rules. 
Their legal action escalates tensions with the British government, and the relationship is in contrast to France and Germany where governments have bailed out their carriers. 
The airlines said they wanted the government to re-adopt its previous quarantine policy introduced on March 10 which applied only to passengers arriving from countries deemed as high risk. 

They also dismissed ""air bridges"", bilateral deals between countries with low infection rates, which the government has presented as a potential alternative to the quarantine, saying they had not yet seen any evidence of how these would work.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bank of Singapore, the private banking arm of lender OCBC (SI:OCBC), plans to grab a bigger share of the fast-growing family office business by expanding its investment products and targeting clients outside the region, its CEO said.
Its assets under management declined to $104 billion in the year to March from $108 billion a year ago due to the market downturn but assets of the segment catering to family offices, which manage the fortunes of the rich, rose 20%.
""The family office is a big segment, not only from China but also from the Middle East as well as other parts of the world,"" Bahren Shaari told Reuters in an interview.
Bank of Singapore, which was ranked No. 6 in Asian Private Banker's league table last year, competes with UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) in providing family offices of rich Asians with services including investments and wealth transfer.
Incentives offered by Singapore to set up such private investment vehicles has boosted demand for services by wealthy individuals in the Middle East and other places.
""There is wealth transfer happening between the first generation to the next generation. Managing money in the past was a part-time business, now it's a full-time business,"" said Bahren, 57.
""There is a big interest in private markets. We make sure we have a complete offering on hedge funds, private equity, direct investments and real estate. That has grown quite a fair bit over the last one year.""
Bank of Singapore is also evaluating setting up an onshore presence in China at a time when Beijing's crackdown on shadow banking is pushing investors to the mainstream wealth management business.

""We look at the opportunities. Of course, there's an urgency to really look at what we can do onshore,"" said Bahren, adding this could be done with local partnerships.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged lower Friday, with the U.K. markets underperforming after very weak GDP figures illustrated the depth of the slowdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak.

116,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",Scrub that: Pandemic forces ship owners to shelve anti-pollution gear,"By Jonathan Saul
LONDON (Reuters) - Ship owners are postponing or cancelling the installation of ""scrubbers"" that extract harmful sulphur emissions from their vessels as the coronavirus pandemic tightens finances. 
Regulations from United Nations agency the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which took effect in January, were viewed by the oil and shipping industries as one of the first worldwide efforts to enforce environmental change.
The rules aimed to make ships use fuel with a sulphur content of 0.5%, compared with 3.5% previously. Operators had the alternative option to install devices - scrubbers - to strip out the pollutant, which causes lung problems among humans and contributes to acidification of oceans and acid rain, but has not been directly linked to climate change like carbon. 
In the run-up to IMO 2020, dozens of traders and ship owners, bet on installing scrubbers hoping to make a profit from buying cheaper high-sulphur fuel as the newly developed 0.5% alternative would be in tight supply. 
But with an average cost of $2 million to install just one, the stakes were already high for fleet operators often facing investments of more than $100 million. Now the industry financial squeeze, caused by a decline in demand for freight services due to the COVID-19 crisis, may mean scrubbers become less of an option for ship owners to comply with regulations. 
Leading Norwegian firm Wallenius Wilhemsen (OL:WALWIL), which transports cars and other vehicles, told Reuters it had cancelled scrubbers for nine ships in the past few months and postponed an additional eight until later this year or 2021. 
""As a result primarily of the COVID-19 pandemic, customers have significantly reduced their output of vehicles,"" a spokeswoman said. ""With that comes a reduction in revenues and we are taking all necessary steps to reduce cash outflows.""
The global oil price crash has also prompted a slide in the differential between lower (LSFO) and higher-sulphur fuel (HSFO) to as low as $40 a tonne, from over $300 at the start of the year, eating into profitability for companies who paid for scrubbers and lengthening the time for a return on their investment. 
""The scrubber play is not so much a technical or scientific issue, it is much more of a commercial issue,"" said Knut Orbeck-Nilssen, chief executive of risk management group DNV GL's maritime division.
Other companies, including Scorpio Tankers (K:STNG), Frontline (OL:FRO) and International Seaways (N:INSW), said they had postponed instalments. Frontline said the postponement of scrubbers for four of its tankers would provide an estimated ""positive cash impact"" of $7.6 million in 2020. 
SCRUBBER PAYBACK 
Lois Zabrocky, chief executive of International Seaways, said the company had also decided to postpone the installation of scrubbers for three vessels. 
""With the narrow price differential, it doubles the length of time for scrubber payback. Seaways installed scrubbers on our highest-consuming ships and the payback period is likely within 2-3 years,"" she told Reuters.  
Clarksons Research said it recorded a significant slowing in the number of ships already in service installing scrubbers, estimating there were under 100 vessels undergoing retrofits versus over 300 at the start of the year. 
Clarksons said the number of ships pending retrofits was 750 – some of which may be postponed or cancelled – versus a peak of over 2,000 pending in the middle of 2019. They estimated there were now 3,015 ships fitted with scrubbers, from 506 at the start of 2019.
The global ocean-going fleet is widely estimated at over 90,000 ships. 
Even though COVID-19 restrictions at Chinese shipyards have gradually eased, shipping sources say industry appetite to install scrubbers is at its lowest since a rush in 2018. 
Finland's Wartsila (HE:WRT1V), which manufacturers scrubbers, said while it had not had any cancellations, there were postponements, mainly due to delays and congestion at the yards or other scheduling issues.
'WE ARE VERY HAPPY'
Asked about the impact of slowing demand for scrubbers, the IMO said it would have no effect on adherence to its rules as ships would instead have to use fuels that meet its criteria. 
When asked about how the regulations have gone so far, a spokeswoman added: ""It seems to have gone very smoothly. Availability of compliant fuel also seems positive"". 
Tanker group  Euronav  (BR:EUAV) was among shipping companies opting to use low-sulphur fuel. 
""We are very happy not to have spent $350 million retrofitting our fleet with scrubbers,"" CEO Hugo De Stoop told Reuters. 
Companies that have bought scrubbers say, however, that a rebound in oil prices – and a narrower difference in costs between high and low sulphur fuel - will once again make the devices more cost-effective.

G. Shivakumar, chief financial officer with the  Great Eastern Shipping  Company (NS:GESC), said it would go ahead with a number of scrubber installations despite the change in the fuel differential, which he described as ""disappointing"".

""Once we've made all the necessary assessments ... we will make a decision, probably in July, also considering public finance needs, which by then will be clearer,"" Conte was quoted by Corriere della Sera after meeting with several dailies. ""In any case, the parliament will have the last word on the matter."" 
Italy's 5-Star Movement, the largest party in the ruling coalition, is opposed to using ESM, fearing it could lead to economic policy conditions and austerity measures.
Conte said it would be ""insane"" to dedicate even one thought to the idea of creating his own party. 
Asked about the prolonged dispute over the motorway concession of Atlantia's unit Autostrade per l'Italia following the deadly Genoa bridge disaster, Conte said Rome would take a decision in a week or two. 

He added the government had no plans to again speak to Autostrade on the matter, saying ""there is a procedure ongoing and needs to be closed"", according to quotes in La Repubblica.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's street-level shops are seeing a surge of bargain buying and leasing interest in a sign that some believe the worst may be over for the protest-hit city, although as yet the enquiries had not sparked an increase in deals.
The territory's two major realtors specialising in the sector said the increased activity has followed Beijing's move to impose national security legislation on the basis that while politically divisive, the new laws might bring stability.
""For businesses, peace is very important; they think the law is positive to the business environment ... there won't be tear gas and breaking shop windows any more,"" said Daniel Wong, the chief executive of realtor Midland IC&I.
Many retailers were forced to close in the past year as anti-government demonstrations and, in recent months the coronavirus pandemic, disrupted business. Retail sales plunged 36.6% in April from a year earlier.
The new law aims to curb sedition, secession and terrorism and retailers hope it will bring more than a year of protests to an end.
Still, the law has prompted concern over freedoms in the semi-autonomous city and alarmed some in the financial and diplomatic communities. Authorities say it will target a minority of ""troublemakers"".
Wong said enquiries for buying and leasing street-level shops have increased at least 50% in the three weeks since the legislation was proposed.
""They think the worst is over and prices should have bottomed; now it's time for bargain hunting,"" he said, noting his company is managing deals worth over HK$100 million ($12.90 million).
Dennis Cheng, senior sales director at property agency Ricacorp, said enquiries to buy are up 40%, while calls from those looking to rent are up 50%.
""It's turned around from a buyer/tenant market. Now the market is more balanced,"" he said.
However, the bargain hunting had not yet boosted the number of deals, they said, because sellers and buyers are still too far apart in their price expectations.
""Some sellers decided not to sell any more after potential buyers offered very low prices,"" Cheng said.
""They think where shall they put the money after selling the shop? There's monetary easing globally now and it's better to keep brick and mortar.""
Property activity in shopping malls has not picked up as quickly and the office sector is stalled as businesses and investors wait to see how the security law impacts the global financial hub.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Argentina's stocks are rocketing, outpacing equity market peers around the world in the second quarter as growing risk appetite has lured investors to the country's listed firms despite biting economic and debt crises.
The S&P Merval stock index (MERV) plunged near 50% from mid January to mid March. But this quarter, price returns in pesos for the 20-stock index have climbed as much as 100%. When translated to U.S. dollars using the official exchange rate, they are now up 64%, the most among the largest stock markets globally.
Investors jumped in even as Argentina's government has scrambled to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt and forecasts called for the economy, mired in recession since 2018, to contract as much as 10% this year.
""There are periods of time where it gets just so cheap that people come rushing and move it to the opposite side for a while,"" said Robert Lutts, chief investment officer at Cabot (NYSE:CBT) Wealth Management in Salem, Massachusetts.
Lutts recently added to his holdings of Buenos Aires-based e-commerce giant Mercado Libre (O:MELI) but said he would not broaden his exposure to Argentina partly on concerns over financial markets' lack of confidence in the country.
Argentina defaulted for the ninth time in May following turmoil sparked last year by the sharp political decline of President Mauricio Macri, seen as a market reformer.
Yet his successor, moderate Peronist Alberto Fernandez, is now seemingly closing in on a debt restructuring deal with international creditors, a development credited as one reason behind the latest leg of the stocks rally. 
Graphic: Stock price Q2 returns in USD, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopakroqpa/2020-06-11_18h22_34.png
Some analysts said tight capital controls have added luster to the rally. Parallel trades of the peso value the currency much more cheaply than the official rate, a gap which has widened sharply this year.
""The record in peso terms is more an effect of the currency's devaluation than anything else,"" said Gustavo Ber, senior economist at local consultancy Estudio Ber.
""The stock market is not reacting to fundamentals as much as it is to money flows,"" said Ber, adding it was ""mostly hot money"" meaning traders ready to cash gains.
The Merval is off 12% since hitting a record high on Monday. 
Ber said the global ""risk-on"" mentality was first seen in the performance of Argentine stocks traded in U.S. exchanges and those speculative bets were later reflected in the local market.
Graphic: 2020 performance: Argentine ADRs, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwyzegvw/ArgentinaADRs.png
The return on Argentina's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) is 22% for the quarter so far (BKAR), compared to a 16% increase for the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 (SPX).
What makes Argentina exceptional is that all its major stocks are listed in New York as ADRs, offering international investors an easy way to play Argentina.
""That means a lot of stocks remain investable under a sovereign default which would normally put equities off limits,"" said Dubai-based Hasnain Malik, emerging markets equity strategist at Tellimer.
Some like Mercado Libre (O:MELI) and Globant (K:GLOB) offer investors exposure further afield. They are based in Argentina but generate most revenues internationally.
""While there are still massive uncertainties ahead for the sovereign debt restructuring and the economy, there are unique circumstances for one or two of these ADR listings,"" Malik said.
Mercado Libre's ADR is up near 50% this year and 75% this quarter alone. The local stock (BA:MELI), up 137% this quarter, is not part of the Merval index.
Argentina exposure has the sixth-largest overweight among active global emerging market funds at +0.66% above benchmark, according to Copley Fund Research. Some 40% of active Global EM funds in a sample of 224 were invested in Argentina and 38% are overweight the country. 
Mercado Libre is also a favorite. GQG Partners, Merian Global Investors and Fisher have all opened new positions in that stock this year, said Copley founder Steven Holden.
""Confidence is starting to return with ownership and allocations rising over the last 6 months,"" said Holden.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open mixed Friday, with investors searching for direction after the sharp losses of the previous session interrupted the remorseless move higher of the last month.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.9% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were down 0.2%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.6%.
Stock markets sold off aggressively Thursday, after the Federal Reserve had warned of a slow recovery for the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, from the ravages of the Covid-19 virus as well as renewed fears of a second wave as economies are gradually reopened.
The three major U.S. stock indices fell more than 5%, posting their worst day since mid-March, while the three main indices in Europe--the DAX, the CAC 40 and the FTSE 100--all dropped around 4%.
However, this selloff came after equities had been on the tear since late March, with the NASDAQ Composite reaching record highs and the S&P 500 climbing over 40% from March lows in the U.S.. Europe has seen a similar picture.
This has created a difficult decision for investors - do they accept this hefty drop as a blip and continue positioning for the upward trend, or is this move lower the start of a concerted selloff?
“Certainly there are going to be some second-wave concerns so it is right for the market to be worried about that...we also had seen an incredible rally from the bottom so the idea that investors might be looking to take some profits here is certainly what’s driving the sell-off as well,” said Lori Heinel,  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors deputy global chief investment officer, Bloomberg reported.
The latest Gross Domestic Product data from the U.K., usually one of the early G7 members to release their preliminary numbers, may help investors choose a path, and the news earlier Friday wasn’t good.
Britain’s economy suffered a record collapse during April’s coronavirus lockdown, with GDP dropping 20.4% on the month, weaker than the predicted 18.4% collapse. 
In corporate news, U.K.-based publishing and education company  Pearson  (LON:PSON) may be in the spotlight after it was reported that activist investment firm Cevian Capital had built a stake of just over 5%.
French catering firm Sodexo (PA:EXHO) could also be in focus after dropping out of the CAC 40 Index following a quarterly review, to be replaced by call-center operator  Teleperformance  (PA:TEPRF)
Oil prices continued to head lower Friday, heading for the first weekly loss since late April on fears a second Covid-19 wave could derail a fragile recovery, while swelling stockpiles raised fresh concerns about excess supply.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>",U.S. lawmakers ask Zoom to clarify China ties after it suspends accounts,"By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Three U.S. lawmakers asked  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) to clarify its data-collection practices and relationship with the Chinese government after the firm said it had suspended user accounts to meet demands from Beijing. 
The California-based firm has come under heavy scrutiny after three U.S. and Hong Kong-based activists said their accounts had been suspended and meetings disrupted after they tried to hold events related to the anniversary of China's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) crackdown. 
Zoom said on Friday it was notified of the events and asked to take action by the Chinese government in May and early June. It said it has now reinstated these accounts and will not allow further requests from China to affect users outside the country.
""We did not provide any user information or meeting content to the Chinese government,"" Zoom said in a statement. ""We do not have a backdoor that allows someone to enter a meeting without being visible.""
The online meeting platform, which has surged in popularity as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced millions around the world indoors, has seen its downloads soar in China.
The service is not blocked in China, unlike many Western platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, which abandoned efforts to crack China's market years ago due to government demands to censor and monitor content. Twitter on Thursday said it had removed accounts tied to a Beijing-backed influence operation. 
Representatives Greg Walden, the top Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the ranking member of a consumer subcommittee, sent a letter to Zoom CEO Eric Yuan on Thursday asking him to clarify the company's data practices, whether any was shared with Beijing and whether it encrypted users' communications. 
Republican Senator Josh Hawley also wrote to Yuan asking him to ""pick a side"" between the United States and China. 
The three politicians have previously expressed concerns about TikTok's owner, Chinese firm ByteDance, which is being scrutinized by U.S. regulators over the personal data the short video app handles.
""We appreciate the outreach we have received from various elected officials and look forward to engaging with them,"" a Zoom spokesman said. 
China's internet watchdog, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment from Reuters. 
SEPARATE CHINA FROM THE WORLD
Wang Dan, a U.S.-based dissident and exiled student leader of the crushed 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, had his Zoom account suspended. He said he was shocked to hear Zoom acknowledge it had interrupted meetings he was participating in. His June 3 event with about 200 participants was deactivated midstream, he said. 
""Zoom compiled with China's request, preventing us from going about our lives smoothly,"" Wang said in an email to Reuters. ""It cannot get away with just a statement. We shall continue to use legal means and public opinion to ask Zoom to take responsibility for its mistake.""
The company said it is now developing technology to enable it to remove or block participants based on geography, allowing it to comply with requests from local authorities. It said it would publish an updated global policy on June 30.
U.S.-based Humanitarian China founder Zhou Fengsuo said he welcomed Zoom's acknowledgement of the suspensions but told Reuters it was unacceptable for the company ""to separate China users from the rest of the world.""
The company's China links have been called into question before.
Toronto-based internet watchdog Citizen Lab said in April it had found evidence some calls made in North America, as well as the encryption keys used to secure those calls, were routed through China. Zoom said it had mistakenly allowed Chinese data centres to accept calls. 
Zoom says it has many research and development personnel in China. Its founder Yuan grew up and attended university in China before migrating to the United States in the mid 1990s. He is now an American citizen.

Bill Bishop, editor of the China-focused Sinocism news letter, wrote on Friday that ""Zoom should no longer get the benefit of the doubt over its China-related issues and given how many people, organizations, government bodies and political campaigns now rely on its services the company must err on the side of transparency.

Investing.com – Asian stocks ended the week with losses, feeling the effects of a slump in U.S. markets overnight over mounting fears of a second wave of COVID-19 cases.
This fear was triggered with the number of cases in the U.S. surpassing 2 million after some states loosened lockdown measures. Globally, there are now almost 7.5 million cases.
“All of a sudden the coronavirus, which has been an also-ran story for some days now, became more important as the virus began picking up in some states, and the market began thinking there may be delays to reopening,” Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel, told Reuters.
The fears added to investor gloom over a grim picture of U.S. economic recovery painted by the U.S. Federal Reserve as it wrapped up its policy meeting on Wednesday.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.31% by 10:36 PM ET (3:36 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI slid 2.34%, clawing back its opening losses of over 4%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 was down1.68%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 1.11%. China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.60% while the Shenzhen Component lost 0.63%.
But other investors presented a more optimistic view.
“Certainly there are going to be some second-wave concerns so it is right for the market to be worried about that...we also had seen an incredible rally from the bottom so the idea that investors might be looking to take some profits here is certainly what’s driving the sell-off as well,” Lori Heinel,  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors deputy global chief investment officer, told Bloomberg."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Taco Bell parent Yum Brands Inc sued Grubhub Inc on Thursday for allegedly violating a delivery contract, a day after Europe's Just Eat Takeaway.com agreed to buy the U.S. food delivery company for $7.3 billion.
Yum invested about $200 million in Grubhub in 2018 and struck a partnership to deliver food from thousands of its KFC and Taco Bell restaurants across the United States.
But the relationship apparently soured after Yum - which also owns Pizza Hut and Habit Burger – broadened its delivery partners to include two of Grubhub's biggest rivals, Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats and Postmates, according to the complaint in New York state court.
That led Grubhub last week to throw out its exclusive five-year contract with Yum after just two years. Now Grubhub seeks to impose steeper fees on Yum's franchisees and customers and said Yum had lost its right to a seat on Grubhub's board, the complaint alleged.
Grubhub ""vigorously"" denies the allegations and will protect itself from Yum's breach of exclusivity provisions, a spokesman said, adding that it is ""very sorry about the situation Yum franchisees are in with millions of dollars now at risk especially in the midst of this challenging environment.""
The dispute comes as more restaurant brands have opened up once exclusive relationships with individual delivery partners amid an increase in demand, which accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic.
While Yum franchisees would still pay Grubhub 0% commissions for marketing and delivery, they would now pay the full 3.05% plus $0.30 per transaction, the complaint said.
Grubhub would also start collecting a 17% diners fee, which customers themselves could have to pay if Yum franchisees increase menu prices or charge service fees to make up for the extra cost.

The delivery agreement had required Grubhub to pay Yum a $50 million termination fee should Grubhub become controlled by a third-party - which could apply to Just Eat Takeaway.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",Palantir close to registering for stock market debut: sources,"By Joshua Franklin and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) - Data mining firm Palantir Technologies Inc is aiming to file confidentially with U.S. regulators to go public in the coming weeks, emboldened by the strong performance of other initial public offerings (IPOs), people familiar with the matter said.
A string of successful IPOs is paving the way for Silicon Valley firms, concerned about the economic fallout of the global coronavirus outbreak, to follow suit. Shares of online used car seller  Vroom  Inc (O:VRM) more than doubled in their Nasdaq debut on Tuesday, on the heels of eight companies last week that raised more in their IPO than they had planned.
Becoming a publicly listed company would subject Palantir to new scrutiny from investors and the media. Co-founded in 2004 by billionaire Peter Thiel, the data analytics company has been involved in some of the U.S. government's most politically sensitive projects, from identifying terrorists to the tracking of illegal immigrants. 
Palantir is still deliberating whether to go public via a traditional IPO or a direct listing, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the deliberations are private. 
Palantir could go public as soon as September, though the timetable is subject to change and market conditions, the sources said. 
A spokeswoman for Palantir declined to comment.
Palantir has not yet hired investment banks for a listing, but is in discussions with potential advisers that could serve as underwriters, the sources said.  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) is expected to have a leading role, the sources added.
A Morgan Stanley spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Palantir was valued at around $20 billion in its most recent fundraising round in 2015. In the private market, its shares have been trading in recent weeks at a valuation of between $10 billion and $12 billion, according to market sources. 
Palantir expects revenue in 2020 to grow to $1 billion from around $700 million in 2019, according to the sources. For 2021, Palantir expects revenues growing to around $1.5 billion, the sources said. In 2015, the company had told investors it anticipated revenues of around $4 billion by the time it went public, one of the sources added. 
The company has communicated to existing investors the success it has had of late in winning government contracts, both in the United States and overseas, sources said.
Palantir specializes in analyzing large quantities of data. Its customers range from global banks to the U.S. government and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The company's technology aided the U.S. government's successful search for Osama bin Laden, according to multiple media reports.
Public scrutiny of major technology companies working with law enforcement authorities and government agencies has intensified in the wake of protests over the treatment of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) said on Wednesday it was implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of its facial recognition software, halting a business it long defended as many protested law enforcement brutality against people of color. Amazon said it would continue to permit the technology's use by customers that help law enforcement find human trafficking victims.

Palantir has also been working with a number of countries to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, by tracing the spread of the virus and managing the production of critical medical supplies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian equities are set to fall sharply on Friday after Wall Street stocks and oil tumbled over growing concerns that a resurgence of coronavirus infections could stunt the pace of reopening economies.
The three major U.S. stock indexes fell more than 5%, posting their worst day since mid-March, when markets were sent into freefall by the abrupt economic lockdowns put in place to contain the pandemic.

Cases of the disease have jumped in several U.S. states in recent days, raising concern among experts who say authorities have loosened restrictions put in place to contain the spread too early.
Cases in New Mexico, Utah and Arizona rose by 40% for the week ended Sunday, a Reuters tally shows. Florida and Arkansas are other hot spots.
The U.S. Federal Reserve released a gloomy economic outlook at the end of its two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell warned of a ""long road"" to recovery.
Economic data appeared to back up the Fed's projections, with jobless claims still more than double their peak during the Great Recession and continuing claims at an astoundingly high 20.9 million.

(Reuters) - A stock market that shook off the coronavirus pandemic, economic devastation and sky-high equity valuations was reminded of all three on Thursday, as Wall Street took its biggest dive in three months. 
The S&P 500 slumped 5.9% in its steepest one-session loss since March 16, following renewed fears of a coronavirus resurgence as U.S. states gradually reopen their economies after a nearly countrywide shutdown. Investors also reacted to dour economic forecasts from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
(GRAPHIC: U.S. stocks and COVID-19 cases - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dgkvlweqdpb/Stocks%20and%20covid.jpg)
Equities have surged since late March, with the Nasdaq (IXIC) reaching record highs and the S&P 500 (SPX) climbing over 40% from March lows as the number of coronavirus cases nationwide declined modestly. 
The pace of growth in new cases has recently picked up again, although the increase may be partly due to more testing. The one-week moving average of daily new cases stands at 30,553. This measure fell to 27,753 on June 1, from a high of 44,000 on April 14.
Investors also bought stocks on expectations that, following trillions of dollars of economic stimulus, the government and Federal Reserve would step in again to protect the economy if necessary. 
The rally has pushed over 90% of S&P 500 stocks to levels above their 50-day average prices. 
(GRAPHIC: Nearly all S&P 500 companies above 50-day average - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpygrjxpg/50daysma.jpg)
Even as stocks soared, some signs have illustrated many investors' doubts about the rally. Investors have moved increasing amounts of money into money market assets in recent months.
(GRAPHIC: Dash for cash - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmovakrbqva/Dash%20for%20cash.JPG) 
Prices for gold and Treasuries, both popular destinations during uncertain times, have also increased.
Many companies have declined to give earnings forecasts in recent months due to uncertainty about the coronavirus, leading investors to put less emphasis on valuations based on earnings expectations. Still, following Wall Street's recent climb, the S&P 500 is trading at 22 times expected earnings, its most expensive level since the dot-com boom. 
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500's PE revisits dot-com highs - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdkbqypo/SPX%20PE.jpg)
Increased savings, stimulus checks from the government, and ultra-low interest rates have led to a flood of money into the markets from first-time traders, leading to chaotic trades via mobile phone apps.
However, most retail investors have remained very cautious in recent months, according to TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD)'s Investor Movement Index. That index shows the behavior of TD Ameritrade's overall customer base recently becoming slightly less pessimistic after their sentiment fell to eight-year lows in recent months.

128,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>",Microsoft bans face-recognition sales to police as Big Tech reacts to protests,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) said on Thursday it would await federal regulation before selling facial recognition technology to police, making it the latest big firm to back away from the business following protests against law enforcement brutality and bias.
The announcement came shortly after rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) declared it was pausing police use of its ""Rekognition"" service for a year and International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) said it no longer offers the software generally.
In a statement, Microsoft said it has worked on enacting principles and legislation for the software's use.
""We do not sell our facial recognition technology to U.S. police departments today, and until there is a strong national law grounded in human rights, we will not sell this technology to police,"" the company said. The Washington Post first reported the news.
The death of George Floyd, a black man pinned down by a white officer who kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, prompted worldwide protests against racial inequity. Concerns also arose over whether facial recognition could be used against protesters unfairly.
Research found that face analysis was less accurate for people with darker skin tones, adding to activists' warnings that false matches could lead to unjust arrests.
Matt Cagle, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, said, ""When even the makers of face recognition refuse to sell this surveillance technology because it is so dangerous, lawmakers can no longer deny the threats to our rights and liberties.""
Congress has weighed possible regulation for months. 
RIPPLE EFFECT?
Facial-recognition vendors working with police have included Idemia and DataWorks Plus.
One of Amazon's early law enforcement customers, the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon, decided to halt its program after the tech company's policy change. 
""This program was an innovation in law enforcement technology worth exploring, but until stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of it are in place, our program has been suspended indefinitely,"" the office said on Thursday in an internal memo seen by Reuters.
It was unclear if others would follow suit.
Microsoft and Amazon did not answer a request for comment on whether their bans applied to law enforcement broadly, such as an unnamed prison to which Microsoft had previously said it would provide software.
Militaries and intelligence agencies also use facial recognition, an old tool that has become common in recent years because of newer computer models that detect patterns in faces and objects.
But concerns persist over weaknesses with people of color and targeted use against minorities. 
Microsoft said it was updating how it reviews customers looking to deploy the technology widely.
Mike Jude, a director at research firm IDC, said the big companies' decisions - at a time of regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Europe - would earn goodwill without sacrificing much business.

""Is facial recognition a big deal for any of the companies right now? No,"" he said. ""It will be smaller players that provide specific solutions to law enforcement that will be put in a bind.""

129,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 06:36PM ET</span>",Exxon Slows Gulf Refinery Expansion After Slump in Fuel Demand,"(Bloomberg) --  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). will delay the startup of its Beaumont refinery expansion on the Texas Gulf Coast by a year as the oil giant weathers low demand for petroleum products and seeks to save cash amid the Covid-19 pandemic, people familiar with the plans said.
The project, which will make Beaumont the biggest refinery in the U.S., will now be up and running sometime in 2023, compared with a previous target of 2022, the people said.
Exxon is “evaluating all appropriate steps to significantly reduce capital and operating expenses in the near term as a result of market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and commodity price decreases,” spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry said in a statement. He declined to comment on individual projects.
By the time it’s complete, Beaumont’s daily refining capacity will be about 619,000 barrels a day, a 65% increase that will put it ahead of Saudi Aramco’s 607,000 barrel-a-day Motiva plant in Port Arthur, Texas.
A key reason for the expansion was to use crude from Exxon’s aggressive production ramp-up in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. But the Covid-19 pandemic caused the oil major to slash its 2020 capital spending plans 30%, with the Permian the largest component of the cutback, lessening the immediate need for an increase in refining capacity.
Despite the startup delay, construction of supporting slabs for the new units at Beaumont is continuing, and the pace of the work will accelerate in January, the people said. The refinery continues to run at reduced rates because of lower demand for its products like gasoline and jet fuel.
Also Read: Exxon Refinery to Become Biggest in U.S. on Permian Oil Boom
Exxon hasn’t given a cost estimate for the expansion, but has said it will add a unit with the capacity to process 250,000 barrels a day of light, low-sulfur crude, as well as supporting hydrotreaters, which remove sulfur from the fuel. Beaumont is about 80 miles (129 kilometers) east of Houston, in the heart of the Western Hemisphere’s primary refining and petrochemicals hub.
Before the shale boom, Gulf Coast refineries customized their equipment to process heavy, high-sulfur blends from places such as Canada, Venezuela and Mexico. But production growth from the Permian has been so strong that, before the pandemic, there was sometimes a lack of refining capacity for its light, low-sulfur crude.

The trade group estimated losses for airlines in Latin America at $4 billion this year, with total losses for the industry expected to reach $84 billion globally.
Latin America has imposed stricter travel restrictions than most regions to fight coronavirus. Colombia and Argentina have banned international flights through to Aug. 31, while other countries including Peru, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama have also grounded all flights and repeatedly extended those bans as the disease has spread.
Airline revenues from passenger transport in Latin America are expected to fall $18 billion this year. Some 93% of regular flights are grounded, while operations in some countries have been practically stationary for four months, said IATA's regional vice president for the Americas, Peter Cerda. 
""They can't hold out beyond July, we have to begin planning for domestic flights in Latin America to be in the air soon and then shortly restart international flights,"" Cerda during a virtual press conference. 
He highlighted the urgency of restarting flights in Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Panama, and also called on governments across the region to implement processes which will allow airlines to transport passengers safely. 
Cerda called on governments to financially support airlines which have already exhausted their two to three month liquidity limits. 
""If we continue down this road we are going to see many more airlines declaring Chapter 11 bankruptcy as well as others who won't be able to restart flights or will be forced to close,"" he said. 

Following long weeks of quarantine to halt the spread of coronavirus, LATAM Airlines (NYSE:LTM) and Avianca Holdings (NYSE:AVH) were forced to declare bankruptcy, putting Latin America in pole position as the region with airlines in financial ruin.

""Enable us to do some reasonable amounts of business,"" he said, according to the report, while speaking on a webcast with publishing and event production company Aviation Week.
Rovinescu's remarks were in the context of a letter sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau from the Canadian travel and tourism industry, calling for a national plan to cut back pandemic travel restrictions, Air Canada said.
He is a signatory to the letter, which featured in the Globe and Mail newspaper on Thursday.
Canada and the United States are set to extend a ban on non-essential travel to late July as both countries seek to control the spread of the new coronavirus, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing three sources familiar with the matter.
Washington and Ottawa introduced month-long restrictions in March and renewed them in April and May. The ban, due to expire on June 21, does not affect trade.
Airlines, including Air Canada, have been among the worst hit as coronavirus-led travel bans resulted in thousands of flight cancellations, forcing carriers to cut jobs and costs as revenue dried up.

Rousseau said last month Air Canada was seeing fewer cancellations and an improvement in demand for air travel as lockdowns eased. Canada's largest carrier has announced a summer schedule with nearly 100 destinations.

Supermarket operator Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co. finished in the green, eking out a 0.4% advance after BMO raised its price target for the stock. That’s in stark contrast to the benchmark equity gauge, which plummeted 5.9% as fears of a second wave of U.S. coronavirus infections gripped markets. More than 60 of the index’s members lost at least 10%.
Thursday’s selloff unwound risk-on sentiment that had been building for several weeks, with investors bidding up battered industries best poised to profit as states reopened. However, signs that virus cases are rising in some regions halted the rotation: airlines and cruise companies were among the hardest hit, with Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd. plummeting over 16% in the day’s worst performance. Meanwhile, in the technology-heavy Nasdaq 100, virtual meeting company  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), Inc. was the only stock to gain.
“The entire thesis that the virus was over was pretty flawed,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. “The catalyst is the second-wave narrative, but the precondition is stocks were fully valued at best and overvalued at worst.”
Taken against the S&P 500’s 45% advance since late March, Thursday’s slump is but a blip. And despite the selloff -- which erased nearly $2 trillion of market value -- the index’s forward valuation was still 13% higher than in February, when the virus crash began.

LATAM, the bondholders and Moelis did not immediately comment on the matter. Blackrock declined to comment.
LATAM filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection last month, aiming to restructure $18 billion in debt. It was the world's largest airline to date to seek an emergency reorganization due to the coronavirus pandemic.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Argentine takeover of soy crusher Vicentin may scuttle Glencore's Renova bid - sources,"By Hugh Bronstein
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A planned bid by  Glencore  (L:GLEN) to buy out the remaining stake in its Argentine soy crushing joint venture Renova will likely be scuttled by the government's plan for a state takeover of bankrupt partner Vicentin, two sources close to the situation told Reuters.
However, the government's planned takeover of Vicentin, which holds 33% of Renova alongside majority partner Glencore, should not dent agricultural exports from Argentina, said both sources, who asked not to be named due to the political sensitivity of the matter. 
Glencore and the president's office declined to comment. A government source, who also asked not to be named, said it was too early for the state to decide what it would do with Vicentin's stake in Renova. 
Center-left Peronist President Alberto Fernandez on Monday decreed an intervention in Vicentin, once Argentina's No. 1 exporter of soy byproducts, while his administration seeks Congress approval for a state takeover.
Renova, located on the banks of the Parana River in Argentina's soy hub of Rosario, is one of the world's biggest soy crushing plants. Glencore, which owns 66.7%, had offered to buy Vicentin's stake in the plant for $325 million, Reuters reported previously, but the deal had become bogged down in Vicentin's bankruptcy proceedings.
""Glencore would still like to buy the remaining share of Renova, but the government is very unlikely to sell. I don't see that happening,"" one of the sources close to the bid talks said, adding that neither Vicentin nor Glencore was told in advance of Monday's decree.
A second industry source with knowledge of the situation also said that Glencore's bid for full ownership of Renova would likely be stalled by the government's intervention in Vicentin.
""But this will mean nothing in terms of Argentine supply of soy products. Argentina will keep crushing 40 million to 42 million tonnes of soybeans per year,"" the source close to the talks said.
Fernandez is set to meet with Vicentin's management late on Thursday.
Asked earlier this week about Vicentin's stake in Renova, Fernandez said it was ""premature"" to make any announcements. 
Local media reported that Fernandez might bow to private sector concerns and cancel the takeover. But the two sources said that was unlikely. 
""The government now has a strategic foothold in the most important sector of the economy. No one has ever seen a Peronist government say, 'Lets stop and go in reverse.' The question is how will Glencore deal with having the government as its new partner,"" said the first source close to the talks.
Vicentin went broke after going on a credit-fueled expansion last year. Argentine political uncertainties related to the October 2019 presidential election sparked a market crash and led international banks to pull back from the crisis-prone country, further pressuring the company.
Vicentin has more than $300 million in commercial debt and more than $1 billion in loans from local and international banks. 
Renova had been owned 50-50 by Glencore and Vicentin until the local company ran out of money late last year. Glencore bought an additional 16.7% of Renova in November and had been angling to purchase the rest. 

Vicentin, founded in 1929, stopped crushing after defaulting on its debt but Glencore had continued paying Renova employees in anticipation of an eventual takeover.

Investing.com -- Stocks went into a tailspin on Thursday as investors sold on fear that a second wave of Covid-19 cases could interfere with a return to business as normal.
The major stock indexes each fell sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled nearly 7%, the S&P 500 fell 5.9%, and the NASDAQ Compositeshed 5%, coming off an all-time high close above 10,000 a day earlier. Crude Oil WTI Futures also fell nearly 10% on Thursday.
Investors will be watching Friday to see whether stocks can halt their losing streak or whether they will head into the weekend on a down note.
Consumer sentiment data for June is expected out on Friday, as well as data on imports and exports.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Consumer Sentiment Expected to Improve Despite Covid-19
The Covid-19 virus hasn't dampened consumers' outlooks, at least as far as expectations for Friday's Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey, due out at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT). The number is expected to be 75 for June, up from 72.5 the prior month. Businesses are reopening and individual restrictions are being loosened in much of the U.S. even though cases of the virus continue to rise in some areas. Of course, the survey comes out two days after the Federal Reserve chairman said the recovery would take a long time, remarks that sent stocks plunging on Thursday.
2. Import Price Data Expected to Show Gain
May's import price index is due out Friday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). The monthly figure for May is expected to come in at 0.6% compared to a contraction of 2.6% for the prior month. The index measures the change in the price of imported goods and services purchased in the U.S.
3. Export Price Data Also Expected to Be Positive
Also on Friday, May's export price index is due out at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). The monthly figure is expected to be a gain of 0.6% compared to a contraction of 2.6% the prior month. The figure tracks changes in U.S. exports to determine whether there was an increase in goods sold abroad or merely an increase in the price of exported goods.

Investing.com – The Dow plunged Thursday, suffering its biggest one-day decline since March, as a jump in new Covid-19 infections that threatens to slow down the pace of the reopenings prompted investors to ditch stocks and flee to safety.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.90%, or 1,861 points. The S&P 500 fell 5.27%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 5.27%. 
New coronavirus cases increased by 20,486 from 17,376 yesterday, the Center for Disease Control reported, taking the total infections nationwide to 2 million with nearly 116,00 dead so far.
With new infections on the rise, investors were forced to assess whether their recent bets on the swift rebound in the economy may have been overdone just a day after the Federal Reserve's gloomy outlook on the economy.    
Energy stocks, travel, energy, and bank stocks, which together had been pushed on the progress of the economic reopening, bore the brunt of selling, sending the broader market sharply lower.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) fell 13%,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) was down 9.8% and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) fell 8.3%, pressured by falling Treasury yields and fresh fears that a long road to economic recovery could force banks to sock away more cash to offset loan defaults.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Carnival (NYSE:CCL), and Norwegian Cruise (NYSE:NCLH) were among the biggest decliners in travel.
Losses in energy, meanwhile, were exacerbated by a slump in oil prices as concerns about demand persisted a day after the U.S. reported that weekly crude supplies swelled to a record last week.
Technology, which has held firm in recent days, also came under pressure, paced by a decline in FANG stocks and chipmakers.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slumped 6%, led by declines in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).
On the economic front, the labor market continues to steady, with initial jobless claims falling to 1.5 million in the week ended June 6, less than the 1.6 million expected.
""On the heels of last week’s better-than-expected May employment report, this morning’s continued decline in the pace of weekly claims reinforces the notion the U.S. labor market is on the mend – or at least noticeably improving from more massive weakness reported earlier in Q2,"" Stifel added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday unveiled its version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a $740 billion bill setting policy for the Defense Department on everything from troop salaries and equipment purchases to great power competition with China. 
The 2021 bill also wades into current controversies revolving around racial issues highlighted by protests after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, an African American.
The proposed NDAA, which is several steps from becoming law, backs renaming bases named after Confederate generals and bars the use of the military against peaceful protests.
This year's bill, like others in recent years, includes provisions focused on China, including creating the ""Pacific Deterrence Initiative,"" a nearly $7 billion fund focused on competition in the Indo-Pacific.
It also includes measures to strengthen the U.S. supply chain, after the coronavirus crisis exposed companies' dependence on China, and extends limitations on integrating missile defense systems with those of China.
The NDAA authorizes $44 million for vaccine and biotechnology research, another response to the pandemic.
It requires new reports on risks posed by the use of technology from Huawei, a Chinese company regarded in Washington as a security threat but whose 5G networking products are widely used around the world.
The bill also authorized $9.1 billion for 95 F-35 aircraft, which are made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). And it authorized the Air Force to modify six F-35s originally sold to Turkey. They were never delivered due to a disagreement over Ankara's purchase of a Russian missile defense system.
The Republican-led panel backed the bill by 25-2.

To become law for the 60th consecutive year, the 2021 NDAA must be reconciled with a version of the bill from the Democratic-led House of Representatives before it can pass Congress and be sent for Republican President Donald Trump's signature or veto.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street tumbled in a broad sell-off on Thursday, with the Dow plunging well over 5%, as a cautionary economic forecast from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the prospect of a possible resurgence of COVID-19 infections put investors in risk-off mode.
The S&P 500 and the Dow were on course for their worst day since March 18, when markets were shocked by the abrupt economic lockdowns put in place to curb the coronavirus pandemic. The Nasdaq was set to snap a three-day streak of record closing highs.
Everything's for sale,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""There's fear we're near a top."" 
""The chatter today is back on the virus and the potential for a second wave of the virus,"" he said.
Deaths of Americans from COVID-19 could reach 200,000 in September, a grim result of the United States' economic re-opening before getting growth of new cases down to a controllable level, according to a leading health expert.
At the conclusion of its two-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve released its first pandemic-era economic outlook, after which Chair Jerome Powell warned of a ""long road"" to recovery.
Economic data appeared to back up the Fed's dour economic projections, with jobless claims still more than double their peak during the Great Recession and continuing claims at an astoundingly high 20.9 million.
A year-on-year drop in core producer prices also reflected the central bank's disinflationary concerns.
""The (economic) data points are so far away from consensus, it's hard to say we're headed in the right direction,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""We're going to have fits and starts, and it won't be a smooth ride until the end of the year.""
The CBOE volatility index (VIX), a barometer of investor anxiety, hit its highest level since May 14.

All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 were in the red, with energy (SPNY) and financials (SPSY) suffering the largest percentage drops.
Interest rate-sensitive banks <.SPXBK> slipped 8.3%, after the Fed indicated key interest rates would remain near zero through at least 2022. 
Travel-related companies, among the hardest hit by mandated lockdowns, were sharply lower.

The number of stocks falling on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded those rising by 2,058 at one point, sending the NYSE TICK Index to a record low. It happened as the S&P 500 Index fell more than 4%, declining for a third straight day in the longest losing streak since early March.
The downturn comes less than a month after the TICK Index set a record high, but there were signs recently that pointed to the inevitability of a quick reversal. Measures of positioning looked stretched, technical gauges pointed to an overbought market, and retail investors were scooping up badly beaten down shares left and right. Previous equity bulls who called the stock rally began to dial back their optimism, concerned an S&P 500 up more than 40% had run too far too fast.
After two days of more modest declines, that pullback came sharply Thursday. As of 12:55 p.m. in New York, every stock in the Dow was lower. In the S&P 500, only seven stocks were trading in the green.
This isn’t the first time extreme TICK readings have appeared this year, but most thrusts have been in favor of buying. On May 18, there was a moment when the number of stocks rising on the NYSE exceeded those falling by 2,049, an all-time high. Today’s record to the downside out-paces even that.
“All of the historic absolute TICK readings we’ve seen depict a market that remains tied to emotion,” said Frank Cappelleri, Instinet LLC’s senior equity trader and market technician. “When that’s the case, big moves can incite momentum swings like we’re seeing today.”

Nestle's water business, which generated sales of 7.8 billion Swiss francs ($8.3 billion) and growth of just 0.2% last year, has been underperforming for years, leading the group to announce an overhaul of the division last year.
In a statement on Thursday it said it was expecting to conclude a strategic review of the regional spring water brands, purified water business and beverage delivery service at its Nestle Waters (NYSE:WAT) North America unit by early 2021 after deciding they were not main areas of focus.
It said the business, excluding international brands, had sales of around 3.4 billion francs in 2019. 
Its focus will for now on be on its international water brands, Perrier, S.Pellegrino and Acqua Panna, as well as high-margin premium and functional water brands, it said. 
Strategic acquisitions were also an option to grow in this category, it added.

Nestle has been trying for some time to revive sales in the United States, where it has lagged rivals such as PepsiCo (O:PEP), LaCroix (O:FIZZ) and Coca-Cola (N:KO) in the sparkling and flavoured water market.

(Reuters) - European shares suffered their worst day in more than 11 weeks on Thursday after a sobering economic outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve and worries of a second wave of COVID-19 cases.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) fell 4.1%, its fourth straight daily fall, with automobile stocks (SXAP) leading losses. 
 Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) fell 7.7% and  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA (PA:PEUP) 10% after a report that the carmakers will face a lengthy EU antitrust probe over their planned $50 billion merger.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) fell 14.1% after its chairman said nationalisation was not being contemplated. The carmaker recently obtained a 5 billion euro ($5.7 billion) loan, backed by the French state.
The STOXX 600 came further off three-month highs after the Fed indicated that it would take more than just the easing of coronavirus-related curbs for a full-fledged economic recovery, undermining optimism that has buoying markets recently. 
The central bank also forecast a 6.5% contraction in the world's largest economy for 2020. 
The possibility of a fresh rise in U.S. cases also upset hopes for a smooth easing of coronavirus curbs, with a Reuters analysis showing confirmed infections had risen slightly after five weeks of declines, partly due to more testing. 
""Government, companies and people would be better prepared for second wave than for the first one,"" said Roland Kaloyan, European equity strategist, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
""But the problem is there is a limit to the governments injecting money. They're using all the resources now for a V-shaped recovery.""
Travel and leisure stocks (SXTP) were pressured by the prospect of new infections, with British cinema operator Cineworld (L:CINE) the biggest loser on the STOXX 600, plummeting 17.1%.
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) slumped 9.1% after admitting that the positions of up to 26,000 employees are surplus to requirements, suggesting many more jobs will be cut at the German carrier.
European stocks also extended losses late in the session after Wall Street indexes opened substantially weaker, with the S&P 500 (SPX) falling 3%. (N)
Consumer goods giant  Unilever  (NYSE:UL)'s UK-listed shares (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) fell nearly 1% after it proposed to combine its Dutch and British legal entities in a single holding company based in Britain.

The regulator said UniCredit (MI:CRDI),  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), Banca Sella and consumer credit group Findomestic were suspected of making it harder for businesses and households wanting to access state measures to help them through the pandemic crisis. 
In a statement on Thursday, the regulator also said the banks may have failed to provide clear information regarding the eventual increase in interest payments stemming from payment suspensions under debt holiday schemes.
The authority said it was exercising ""moral suasion"" towards another 12 financial institutions - including state-owned bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS) and rivals UBI Banca (MI:UBI) and  Banco Popolare  (MI:BAMI) - after finding similar shortfalls in the information provided to customers about the timing and cost of the loans.
Reuters was unable to contact Banca Sella and Findomestic and the other banks were not immediately available for comment. 
Italian banks have come under fire for delays in granting state-backed loans under liquidity schemes which the government had said could unlock at least 400 billion euros in new financing.
Paolo Angelini, head of supervision at the Bank of Italy, told a parliamentary hearing on Thursday that the central bank had written to a group banks to check why they lagged behind the industry median in meeting requests for state-backed loans.
Angelini said the situation had improved after a slow start and, by the end of May, 61% of requests for fully-guaranteed loans for small firms had been met compared with just 33% two weeks earlier.
He said loans to non-financial companies had increased by 22 billion euros between March and April, compared with 27 billion in Germany, 59 billion in France and 35 billion in Spain.

Investing.com – Wall Street extended losses on Thursday, as the Federal Reserve's sobering outlook on the economy and growing Covid-19 infections in U.S. served as a gut check for investors betting on a ""V"" shaped economic recovery.
A climb in coronavirus infections has stoked fears the pace of reopening the economy in some states could come under threat just a day after the Fed warned the road to economic recovery is paved with uncertainty.
The central bank projections, including expectations for a 6.5% drop in GDP, highlights ""the Fed’s ongoing concerns regarding the state of the U.S. economy and the likely lingering impact of the economic shutdown,"" Stifel said in a note.
Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.22%, or 1409 points, the S&P 500 slipped 4.29%, while the Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3.61%.
Energy stocks, travel, energy, and bank stocks, which together have been pushed higher on bullish bets on a rebound in economic growth in the second half of the year, bore the brunt of selling, sending the broader market sharply lower.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) plunged more than 6%, pressured by falling Treasury yields and fresh fears that a long road to economic recovery could force banks to sock away more cash to offset loan defaults.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Carnival (NYSE:CCL), and Norwegian Cruise (NYSE:NCLH) were among the biggest decliners in travel.
Losses in energy, meanwhile, were exacerbated by a slump in oil prices as concerns about demand persisted a day after the U.S. reported that weekly crude supplies swelled to a record last week.
Technology, which has held firm in recent days, also came under pressure, paced by a decline in FANG stocks and chipmakers.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index slumped 4%, led by declines in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU).
On the economic front, the labor market continues to steady, with initial jobless claims falling to 1.5 million in the week ended June 6, less than the 1.6 million expected.
""On the heels of last week’s better-than-expected May employment report, this morning’s continued decline in the pace of weekly claims reinforces the notion the U.S. labor market is on the mend – or at least noticeably improving from more massive weakness reported earlier in Q2,"" Stifel added."

160,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>","U.S. auto suppliers cheer as carmakers relaunch, but long-term worries remain","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto parts suppliers across North America said they are encouraged as major automakers accelerate production after coronavirus pandemic shutdowns, but are holding back on hiring and investment because of longer-term uncertainty.
U.S. automakers reopened most assembly plants in late May after states began loosening restrictions, and stronger-than-expected retail auto sales in May have automakers ramping up production of the highly profitable trucks and SUVs consumers are buying. [nL1N2DF0VG] 
However, several auto suppliers interviewed by Reuters worry about demand heading into 2021. U.S. and global auto sales are not expected to recover to pre-COVID-19 crisis levels until 2022 or 2023, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst John Murphy said during a presentation on Thursday.
Andreas Weller, CEO of aluminum parts maker Aludyne, sees very strong orders for July, but he laid off more than 10% of his workers because the days of Americans buying 17 million new vehicles a year will not return any time soon. 
""What's the market going to look like for the rest of the year, going into next year? That's a bigger unknown,"" he said.
 Magna International Inc  (TO:MG) CEO Don Walker said orders from automakers were good and the ""big unknown"" was how consumers respond.
""I'll be surprised if anybody moves to shut part of the auto industry production down again,"" he said at a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) conference on Thursday. 
HIRING FREEZES 
Other concerns include the potential for smaller parts makers to fail and bring production to a halt, and the possibility of another COVID-19 outbreak in the fall.
""We don't know what the world is going to be,"" said Joe Perkins, chief executive of engineering and machining firm Busche Performance Group, which counts General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) among its customers. ""I'm very hesitant to predict where the market goes through the balance of 2020 and 2021.""
Most of the 11 supplier executives contacted by Reuters said they are closely watching spending, in some cases laying off or slowly recalling furloughed workers, implementing hiring freezes and delaying capital spending.
In the short term, suppliers said they welcome the accelerating pace of production as automakers try to restock depleted showrooms. Ford said on Wednesday it expected its U.S. assembly plants to regain pre-COVID-19 operating levels by early July. [nL1N2DN0W7]
""They're basically ramping up to full production ... quicker than we thought,"" said John Dunn, Americas CEO for Clean Energy Systems, a  Plastic Omnium  (PA:PLOF) unit that makes fuel and emissions-reduction systems.
The happiest suppliers are those building pickup trucks and SUVs as demand continues to shift from sedans, said Pierre Labat, vice president of global auto for aluminum provider Novelis Inc, which is owned by India's  Hindalco Industries  Ltd (NS:HALC).
Some product-development plans have been delayed by the outbreak, or canceled in some cases like the electric vehicle Ford's Lincoln brand was going to build with Rivian. Bob Roth, co-owner of RoMan Manufacturing, which builds tooling and equipment, lost that job.
""I would be hard-pressed to place my bet at the moment, which puts me in the cautious camp,"" Roth said. ""We've just got to get through the next six-to-18 months.""
The pressure on automakers to reduce CO2 emissions through electrification is a bright spot for some suppliers.

""Automakers realize this isn't a game of poker,"" said Andrew Storm, CEO of Eckhart Inc, which builds robots and automated tools for GM, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and others. ""Either they commit the capital or the disruptive forces of innovation obliterate their long-term existence into the bin of history.""

165,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon set to revive North Sea sale after months of delays - sources,"By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) is preparing to restart the sale of its British North Sea assets after weaker oil prices and the coronavirus outbreak led to months of delay, industry and banking sources said.
The sale process, initially planned for late last year, is expected to raise less than originally expected after a 40% drop in oil prices since January and their weakened long-term outlook.
The top U.S. oil company has in recent weeks held talks with a number of potential North Sea buyers to gauge interest in the portfolio, four sources with direct knowledge of the discussions said on condition of anonymity.
Exxon is unlikely to officially launch the sale process if it finds there is insufficient interest, the sources said.
Exxon declined to comment.
""As a matter of practice, ExxonMobil does not comment on market rumours or speculation about our business plans,"" Exxon spokeswoman Julie King said.
Most of Exxon's British operations are managed through Esso Exploration and Production UK, a 50-50 joint venture with Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), and include interests in nearly 40 oil and gas fields. 
The JV, one of the industry's oldest, has been producing gas since 1968 and oil since 1976. 
The portfolio's value, however, is unclear.
Initially, Irving, Texas-headquartered Exxon hoped to raise over $2 billion from the sale, according to the sources.
They said $1 to $1.5 billion was more likely now given the oil market's weakness.
A spokeswoman for investment bank Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), which is running the sale process, declined to comment. 
With many of the assets approaching the end of their lives, their value will depend largely on how the buyer and Exxon agree to manage the costs of plugging wells and removing unused platforms, a process known as decommissioning.
Potential buyers could include large private equity-backed North Sea producers such as Chrysaor and NEO Exploration & Production. HitecVision, which owns NEO, and Chrysaor declined to comment.
Exxon produces around 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day in the British North Sea, roughly 5% of Britain's daily demand, its website says.
Exxon plans to sell up to $25 billion of assets globally over the coming years to release cash to focus on a handful of mega-projects, three banking sources said.

Last month Exxon also revived the sale of its stake in Azerbaijan's largest oil field, sources told Reuters.

166,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",UK grocer Morrisons' pay policy opposed by 35% of AGM votes,"LONDON (Reuters) - British supermarket group Morrisons (L:MRW) said it would engage with investors over its remuneration policy after it was opposed by more than one third of votes cast at its annual shareholders' meeting.
Ahead of the meeting on Thursday, investor advisory group ISS had recommended shareholders vote against the policy because the pension contribution rate of 24% for Chief Executive David Potts and Chief Operating Officer Trevor Strain was not aligned with the 5% received by most of the company's workforce.
Morrisons said 34.8% of votes cast at the annual general meeting (AGM) were against the resolution to approve the pay policy, while 65.2% were in favour. 
Morrisons said it had undertaken an extensive consultation process before proposing the new remuneration policy. 
""Although the policy vote passed, and we received considerable positive feedback during consultation, the board acknowledges a number of shareholders decided to vote against the policy,"" it said.
""Kevin Havelock (chair of the remuneration committee), on behalf of the board, will therefore continue to engage with shareholders and will report in due course on the outcome of those discussions.""
The AGM, held at Morrisons' headquarters in Bradford, northern England, was not attended by investors, who had to vote by proxy because of the coronavirus lockdown in Britain.
Last month, Morrisons reported a boost to first quarter sales from the lockdown, and said costs related to the pandemic should be broadly offset by the government's business rates relief.

Separately on Thursday the group said it was extending its 10% discount for 1.5 million National Health Service (NHS) workers to the end of September. The discount was introduced in April.

170,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 12:27PM ET</span>",‘Overheated Momentum’ Doomed Stock Market to Quick Reversal,"(Bloomberg) -- In a stock market inundated with retail investors rushing in to buy anything that moves, the swift reversal we’re seeing was more or less inevitable.
That was the warning from Bloomberg Intelligence’s Gina Martin Adams 48 hours ago, just as the S&P 500 Index embarked on what seems likely to be a three-day decline, the longest losing streak since early March. In her view, investors were too optimistic and sentiment was running hot, a recipe for a pullback.
“The strong surge since March lows has finally resulted in an overheated momentum signal, and combined with extremely bullish options positioning, suggests stocks are likely to go through some short-term consolidation,” the chief equity strategist wrote Tuesday.
Hints the stock market was looking stretched were abundant. Martin Adams pointed to the S&P 500’s 14-day relative strength index, or RSI, punching above the critical overbought threshold for the first time since the rally began in March. She also highlighted the Cboe Equity Put/Call Ratio, which measures the relationship between bearish and bullish options, at the lowest level since 2011.
On Monday, the S&P 500 capped its fastest 50-day rally since the Great Depression to wipe out all its losses in 2020. At one point, there wasn’t a single stock in the benchmark that was lower since the rebound began. The Nasdaq 100 surpassed 10,000 for the first time ever, and by Wednesday’s close the index was up 16% this year.
During the runup, the fingerprints of retail investors were everywhere -- with frenzied gains in everything from airlines and cruise stocks to companies in bankruptcy and a Chinese real estate firm with a name similar to the popular “Faang” grouping of U.S. tech stocks. Now, after the bets of individual investors looked prescient, they’re experiencing what it’s like to be on the losing side of a trade.
A Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) basket of stocks beloved by retail investors -- which includes the likes of  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd., United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. -- has dropped 13% since Tuesday, the most since just before the market’s bottom in March. The group rose and fell with the S&P 500 in 11 of the past 12 sessions, a stretch of near lock-step moves not seen since December.
The pain has been worse in companies that have seen individual investor interest surge in recent weeks. After bankrupt Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ) Inc. rose 577% in the three days through Monday and tens of thousands of users of the Robinhood investing app added the stock to their portfolios, half those gains have been wiped out.
In the last three days, the U.S. Global Jets ETF, which has seen its assets surge in recent weeks, is down 20%, the worst stretch since March 20. Over the same time period, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc., Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL). and Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp. have all plunged more than 22%. Each rank high on the list of stocks most favored by retail investors. According to website Robintrack, which tracks Robinhood’s data but isn’t affiliated with it, roughly 500,000 or more users of the app hold each of the three stocks.
Momentum was running hot across large swaths of the market at the week’s start. At Monday’s close, 224 members in the S&P 500 had their 14-day RSI exceeding 70, the level that indicates a stock or index is overbought. That was the most since 1991.
“We felt like a pullback was inevitable because the fundamentals aren’t supporting the levels of return we have seen so far,” said Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation strategy for  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute. “It was largely driven by momentum and not driven by the fundamentals.”
The S&P 500 fell 3.7% on Thursday as of 11:50 a.m. in New York, bringing its losses over three days to almost 5%. Pockets of the market hit hardest in the original coronavirus crash, including small-caps and cyclical industries, again bore the brunt of the losses.
To Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) Mutual Wealth Management, the stock market fell too much on the way down, yet also bounced too quickly on the way up.

Investing.com - President Donald Trump blasted the Federal Reserve on Twitter Thursday after a grim outlook on U.S. recovery from the central bank’s chief took down the stock market by more than 3%, cutting short Wall Street’s weeks-long rally.
“The Federal Reserve is wrong so often,” Trump tweeted, a day after Fed Chairman Jay Powell said he anticipated a ""long road"" ahead for U.S. recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, and that the central bank might keep interest rates near zero through 2022.


Trump, who has consistently criticized Powell and the Fed in the past, purportedly for not cutting rates quickly enough, disagreed again with the central bank’s assessment of Covid-19’s effect on the economy.
""I see the numbers also, and do MUCH better than they do,” tweeted Trump. “We will have a very good Third Quarter, a great Fourth Quarter, and one of our best ever years in 2021. We will also soon have a Vaccine & Therapeutics/Cure. That’s my opinion. WATCH!”
By 12:00 PM ET (16:00 GMT), Wall Street’s Dow was down more than 1,200 points, plunging 4.6%. The S&P 500 lost 3.8% while Nasdaq fell almost 3%.
Total U.S. Covid-19 cases topped 2 million, with a jump in cases reported in Florida, Texas, and Arizona after five weeks of declines across the country. The potential for a second wave of infections from the virus prompted fears there could be another at least partial shutdown of the US economy, which was mostly closed in March and April.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) on Thursday confirmed it plans to start a trial of 30,000 volunteers of its much-anticipated coronavirus vaccine in July as the company enters the final stage of testing.
The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech said the primary goal of the study would be to prevent symptomatic COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The key secondary goal would be prevention of severe disease, as defined by keeping people out of the hospital.
The company's shares jumped 6 percent in premarket trading.
Moderna said it has selected the 100-microgram dose of the vaccine for the late-stage study. At that dose level, the company is on track to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, starting in 2021 from the company's internal U.S. manufacturing site and strategic collaboration with Swiss drugmaker Lonza (S:LONN).
The company said it chose the 100-microgram dose to maximize the immune response and minimize adverse reactions. 
Moderna said is has completed manufacturing of enough vaccine to start the phase 3 trial.
In the midstage study, the company said it has enrolled 300 healthy adults, who have each been dosed with at least one shot, as well as the first 50 older adults, aged 18 to 54.
Testing the vaccine in older adults with be critical because this group is at higher risk for the most severe effects of the virus, and older adults typically have less efficient immune function. The midstage study is testing the safety and preliminary effectiveness of two doses of the vaccine given 28 days apart.

Study participants will be followed for a year.

187,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Volkswagen blames cultural insensitivity for ad criticised as racist,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Thursday apologised for posting on its Instagram page last month an advert widely criticised as racist, and said it was published because of a lack of cultural sensitivity.
In the clip of a few seconds, a black man is depicted next to a new VW Golf, being pushed around by an oversized white hand, meant to be that of his girlfriend, which then flicks him into a building bearing the sign ""Petit Colon"".
Petit Colon is a real cafe in Buenos Aires, Argentina, located near the Teatro Colon. In French the term translates into ""small settler,"" which has colonial undertones. 
Volkswagen withdrew the advert on May 20. and announced on Thursday the findings of a review into how it came to be published. 
""We can state that racist intentions did not play any role whatsoever. We found a lack of sensitivity and procedural errors,"" Hiltrud Werner, Volkswagen's management board member for integrity and legal affairs said in a statement. 
""On behalf of the Board of Management, I would like to formally apologise for hurting people as a result of a lack of intercultural sensitivity,"" he added. 
Volkswagen's management board said it condemned racism and the company explained that the ad was part of a series of clips from the Golf 8 ad campaign depicting a couple who play tricks on each other. 
Without watching the entire campaign however, it is unclear that the white hand is the man's girlfriend.
Volkswagen pledged to boost diversity training and improve controls.
""This advert is tasteless. It is deeply racist. So deeply, that one has no idea where to start,"" said a commentary piece in ROSAMAG, an online magazine for AfroGerman women and friends.
No member of staff at Volkswagen has been dismissed as a result of the campaign, which was produced by Voltage, an ad agency belonging to New York-based DDB Worldwide.
Voltage was not immediately available for comment.
Katja Heintschel von Heinegg, head of Germany's Advertisting Standards Council said: ""the company has withdrawn the advert, and clearly distanced itself from the content.""
""Doubtless the company advertising as well as the agency are now sufficiently sensitive to the issue that something like this will not happen again,"" she added.
PAST BLUNDERS
Volkswagen, which has seen its reputation tarnished in the last five years after it admitted cheating diesel emissions tests, has a history of insensitive blunders. 
Last year Britain's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled an advert for Volkswagen's eGolf, which showed two male astronauts and a male para-athlete followed by a woman sitting with a pram, presented gender roles in a way that was likely to cause harm and should not appear again.
In March last year the company's supervisory board condemned remarks made by the company's chief executive after he appeared to allude to a Nazi-era slogan. 
At the time, Herbert Diess said ""EBIT macht frei"" beforeapologising for the comments and explaining he in no way wantedto draw a comparison to the Nazi-era slogan ""Arbeit macht frei"",which appeared on the gates of Auschwitz during the Holocaust. 
EBIT refers to a company's earnings before interest andtaxes and Diess had sought to emphasise that Volkswagen's operational freedom would increase with higher profitability.

193,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>",Top 1% EM Money Manager Says Couldn’t Ask for Better Bond Market,"(Bloomberg) -- The steep decline in developing-nation debt earlier this year has created an opening for investors to scoop up notes with low default risk on the cheap, according to a top Vanguard Group Inc. money manager.
Dan Shaykevich, the firm’s co-head of emerging-market and sovereign bonds, has bought into a rebound in those securities since March, when the intensifying Covid-19 outbreak spurred the worst selloff since the 2008 financial crisis.
“For an active manager, you cannot ask for a better market because there have been so many opportunities,” Shaykevich said in an interview. “You had some very high-quality assets trading at some very distressed levels.”
The Malvern, Pennsylvania-based firm is shifting its stance toward relative value and is particularly keen on Ukraine, Indonesia and Panama, where Shaykevich says the bonds got beaten down too far. He also snapped up debt from Ecuador and Sri Lanka, betting the nations will avoid defaults and offer higher recovery values. Their dollar notes have returned about 47% and 16% respectively in the second-quarter, trouncing the emerging-market benchmark bond index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The $597 million Vanguard Emerging Markets Bond Fund, which Shaykevich helps oversee, has topped 99% of peers over the past three years with an annualized return of 8.5%, the data show. It also ranks in the 93rd percentile in 2020 with a total return of 4.2%, even as most portfolios suffer losses and as some competitors pile more cash into money-market funds.
DoubleLine Trims Argentina Bet as Fund Builds Up Cash Buffers
While Shaykevich doesn’t expect assets to recover to pre-Covid levels anytime soon, he said there’s room for some notes to rebound further. For instance, bonds from emerging-market exporters and paper-and-pulp companies, which benefit from increased demand for packaging materials, also look attractive, he said. His firm also bought new bonds from higher-rated developing nations including Abu Dhabi and Israel.
“The level of financing needs for emerging-market governments remains very high,” Shaykevich said. “That is going to ultimately benefit investors in emerging markets because countries will have to continue to offer concessions in order to access the markets to fund these gaps.”

Bastian did not say how many would initially be tested but said the program would ""evolve into a full testing protocol – something that will be essential as we ... begin the return to normal operations.""
U.S. airlines have canceled hundreds of thousands of flights as the industry weathers a sharp downturn in air travel due to the coronavirus pandemic but have recently pointed to a modest increase in demand.
Airlines are requiring employees and passengers to wear facial coverings while traveling and have heightened aircraft cleaning procedures among measures aimed at stemming the spread of the virus in-flight and restoring confidence.
Bastian said the infection rate among Delta's employees who come face-to-face with customers has been minimal, nearly five times lower than the national average in May, thanks to the measures it has put in place.
The testing program will begin in Minneapolis, followed by Atlanta, Detroit and New York. 

On Wednesday, Delta said it had created a new division to oversee its standards and policies on cleanliness.

202,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",PayPal pledges over $500 million to support minority-owned U.S. businesses,"By Anna Irrera
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) said on Thursday it was pledging $530 million to support black and minority-owned businesses in the United States and foster diversity, amid worldwide protests over racial injustice.
The bulk of the money - $500 million - will be devoted to the creation of a economic opportunity fund that will invest in black and under-represented minority businesses and communities, the U.S. electronic payments firm said, according to an internal memo and company statement.
The funding will be invested through community banks and credit unions serving minority communities or through direct investments, the company said.
""Let me be clear: I stand with our Black teammates and with the Black community, as does the entire PayPal community,"" CEO Dan Schulman said in the internal memo. ""We stand with you and we support you – and we must publicly declare that Black lives matter.""
PayPal joins a string of U.S. corporations who have committed funds to address racial inequality in the wake of protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. African-Americans have also suffered disproportionately from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) has pledged $1 billion over four years to help communities address economic and racial inequality. Goldman Sachs (N:GS) last week created a $10 million fund for racial equity, while  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) pledged $40 million over four years and $100 million over 10 years. San Jose, California-based PayPal said $10 million of the total pledged will be used for emergency grants to black-owned U.S. businesses hurt by the effects of the coronavirus lockdown.
The grants of $10,000 each will be aimed at covering expenses needed to stabilize and re-open businesses, said Connie Evans, president and CEO of the Association for Enterprise Opportunity, the organization co-managing the program.
""Those businesses aren't going to make it if we can't get immediate resources into their hands,"" Evans told Reuters.
A further $15 million will be used to foster diversity within the company by expanding its inclusion programs, according to the statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - A new European Union law requiring closer scrutiny of foreign clearing houses used by customers from the bloc has been simplified after the United States threatened retaliation.
The law was triggered by Britain's departure from the bloc as the  London Stock Exchange  's (L:LSE) LCH clearing house clears the bulk of interest rate swaps denominated in euros.
U.S. regulators threatened retaliatory measures if Brussels began to closely supervise U.S clearers such as CME Group (O:CME) and ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) (N:ICE), saying it would increase their costs.
Brussels had dismissed the threats as ""blackmail"" but proposals for implementing the law published by the European Commission on Thursday rejected the catch-all approach recommended by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU watchdog that will supervise foreign clearers.
The commission, the EU's executive, said its proposals streamlined and simplified ESMA's approach, making it easier and substantially cheaper for foreign clearers to predict how closely they will be supervised.
Foreign clearers used by customers from the EU will now fall into two tiers with different levels of supervision.
A clearer will only have to give ESMA the sort of access usually reserved to domestic regulators if it is deemed to be ""systemic"". Otherwise, it will only have basic ESMA supervision.
A clearer will be deemed systemic if it clears more than a trillion euros of securities transactions denominated in EU currencies in a year, or its notional outstanding amount of swaps positions was over a trillion euros.
An industry official said the proposals mean that no U.S. clearing house is likely to fall into the tier attracting heightened ESMA supervision.
The EU has long wanted euro clearing to be based in the bloc rather than predominately in London and long-term EU access for the LCH has still to be determined.
LCH cleared swaps worth a notional 117 trillion euros ($133 trillion) in the 12 months to June 10, indicating it will almost certainly be deemed a systemic clearer under the new EU law.
LCH declined to comment on the proposals.

211,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pershing Square's Ackman eyes $1 billion-plus 'blank-check' company - sources,"By Joshua Franklin and Svea Herbst-Bayliss
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management has filed confidentially with U.S. regulators for an initial public offering (IPO) of a blank-check investment vehicle that could raise more than $1 billion and be the biggest of its kind, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Ackman, whose New York-based hedge fund has more than $10 billion in assets under management, is working with investment banks Jefferies (NYSE:JEF), UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) on the IPO, referred to on Wall Street as a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), the sources said. 
The sources requested anonymity because the IPO is still confidential. Pershing Square, UBS and Citi declined to comment. Jefferies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Ackman's new vehicle could eclipse dealmaker and former Citigroup Inc executive Michael Klein's Churchill Capital Corp III as the largest U.S. SPAC IPO ever. Churchill III raised $1.1 billion earlier this year. 
An SPAC uses proceeds from its IPO, together with borrowed funds, to acquire a company, typically within two years. Investors in the IPO do not know in advance which company a SPAC will buy, although many outline in advance the sectors they want to be active in. It is not clear which sector Ackman's SPAC is will target.
Ackman, best known as an activist shareholder who calls for changes at companies, was also a co-sponsor of Justice Holding Inc, a SPAC which acquired restaurant chain Burger King for $1.4 billion in cash in 2012. 
Justice Holdings is now called Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR), and has been a big contributor to Pershing Square's recent investment gains.
Ackman's hedge fund has gained 33% since January, making him one of the industry's best performers after he engineered a hedge for his portfolio that translated into a $2.6 billion windfall. 
In March, he reinvested the money in the stock market, raising his stakes in companies such as Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT), among others. 
Ackman's new venture is the latest high-profile SPAC in what has already been an active year, with the likes of Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya and Starwood Capital Group CEO Barry Sternlicht each raising hundreds of millions of dollars for them this year. 
SPACs have raised $9.8 billion through U.S. IPOs so far in 2020, according to SPAC Research, already three-quarters of the $13.6 billion raised by SPACs in all of 2019, a record year. 

SPACs have been behind some of the most high-profile public listings of the last 12 months, with the likes of space tourism company Virgin Galactic Holdings (NYSE:SPCE), sports betting platform DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) Inc and electric truck maker Nikola Corp going public through SPAC mergers.

212,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",Big Gains on Small Firms Helped U.K. Fund Win the Market Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- When U.K. stocks were cratering in March as the coronavirus outbreak threw markets into turmoil, fund managers Gervais Williams and Martin Turner made a bet that helped them outperform all their rivals.
The pair, who run a fund for Premier Miton Group Plc, bought a stake in Synairgen Plc, a 52 million-pound ($66 million) respiratory drug developer that began clinical trials of a Covid-19 treatment at the end of that month. As the study advanced, the company’s shares soared; they’re up nearly 500% this year.
Boosted by such dramatic performance, Williams (NYSE:WMB) and Turner’s LF Miton U.K. Smaller Companies Fund has gained 20.5% this year, far outstripping its closest competitor, according to Morningstar Inc. data. In fact, most of the biggest U.K. small-cap funds are down, and the benchmark index has dropped about 20%.
The Miton fund was well placed for the virus chaos because it invests in companies with strong balance sheets that can potentially benefit in a recession, Williams said. And when it comes to scooping up bargains in the aftermath of a massive sell-off in the market, focusing on small companies can be an advantage.
“These stocks are traded less frequently, so you don’t have to move extra fast,” Williams said. “There’s plenty of time to load up on stocks after they’ve sold off.”
Virus Test
The U.K. stock market was pummeled in March by the outbreak and the economic lockdown the government imposed to slow it down. Many stocks have since recovered some of their value, buoyed by the massive stimulus unleashed by the government and the Bank of England, but most U.K. equity funds remain down for the year, Morningstar data show.
Williams and Turner came into 2020 with key holdings already in place, particularly the stake they acquired in life sciences firm Avacta Group Plc. Its shares have rocketed 755% this year with a diagnostic test for the Covid-19 infection reaching the prototype stage this week.
Their 54 million-pound fund was also lifted by its long-held stake in digital privacy firm Kape Technologies Plc, which benefited from the surge in people working from home during the lockdown. Kape’s share price has been “resilient even through the market sell-off, where it fell a bit before rising back to an even higher level,” Williams said.
Looking ahead, the managers in May bought “stunningly cheap” shares in ink-jet printing technology company Xaar Plc and Cenkos Securities Plc, Williams said. Both are profitable businesses with cash on hand to fuel growth while many of their competitors struggle with stretched balance sheets, he said.
Woodford Effect
What these small-cap specialists didn’t do was invest in unlisted companies, the strategy that helped bring down once-famed stock picker Neil Woodford. The collapse of his business, combined with uncertainty about the outcomes of Brexit and the U.K. general election last year, scared a lot of investors off small British companies.
“All of that contributed to people avoiding U.K. small-cap stocks generally,” Williams said. “Even though the balance sheets and underlying fundamentals of companies we hold were fine, people just weren’t interested.”
Looking ahead, a lot of small companies could go bust during what could be the U.K.’s deepest recession in three centuries. Banks will be hit with loan defaults and may become more careful about lending, and the times of “easy gushing debt and equity” will come to an end, Williams said. And that will make a focus on solid research and strong balance sheets all the more important.
“We don’t tend to buy the exciting growth stocks,” Williams said. “We’re much more about keeping our feet on the ground, and we’re interested in cash and cash paybacks.”

213,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>",Argentina jockeys to get its barley into Chinese beer,"By Hugh Bronstein and Maximilian Heath
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina is jockeying to get more of its malt barley into Chinese beer, now that Asia's mega-economy is locked in a trade fight with its top barley supplier Australia, according to industry sources in the South American grains powerhouse.
China is the top global importer of malt barley for making pale lagers and other beers, while Saudi Arabia is the top importer of feed barley, which it uses as camel food.
Argentina is expected to export 120,000 tonnes of barley to China this year, said Agustin Baque, foreign trade chief and farm consultant for export firm Alea y Cia S.A. 
""For the next season, if the Chinese maintain import taxes on Australian barley, I think it could double to 240,000 tonnes, maybe more if barley farms in France and Canada have bad crop weather,"" Baque said. Alea y Cia is based in the Atlantic port city of Necochea and specializes in malt barley. 
Argentina's CIARA-CEC export chamber said it was working with the trading companies it represents and the government ""to satisfy current and future Chinese demand for high quality barley.""
Earlier this year, citing allegations of dumping, China slapped an 80% tariff on barley from Australia, amid increasing tensions between the two countries.
Most of Australian barley exports went to China before the trade spat. Australia is expecting a 2020/21 barley crop of 9.5 million tonnes and consumes about 3.5 million tonnes domestically, leaving plenty to be exported.
Baque is concerned Australia might look to sell some of that to other South American countries. 
""Argentina is the biggest exporter of malt barley to the South American market but Australia is very competitive for the next season. So if we don't negotiate with Chinese buyers we could have a supply and demand problem,"" Baque said. 
""For us the Chinese market is new. But our main client is  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), which is the biggest player in the Chinese beer market. We are talking with them about exporting to China.""
BARS CLOSED
The China-Australia trade dispute is not translating into a big increase in barley sowing this season in Argentina, however. With many bars closed around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic, global beer demand is down.
So, with 2020/21 sowing just starting and wheat prices at relatively attractive levels, Argentine farmers are expected to lean toward wheat rather than barley. Argentine wheat and barley are planted in May-June and harvested November-January.
Argentine barley output in the 2020/21 season is estimated at 3.75 million tonnes versus 3.5 million tonnes in the previous crop year, according to the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange. 
One Buenos Aires-based grains industry source, who asked not to be named, said some Australian barley exporters were willing to pay a premium to sell Argentine barley to China and keep their customers. 
""Australian barley exporters are contacting Argentine ones, because Argentina has a long list of processing plants and companies authorized to export barley to China,"" said the source. 
""They are trying to introduce a channel to allow Australian exporters to sell Argentine barley to China in order to not lose that market.""
In calendar year 2019, Argentina exported 1.3 million tonnes of beer barley, of which around 585,000 tonnes went to top buyer Brazil, according to official trade data.

Barley harvesting in the United States, Canada and Europe is around August. To help hold the market until then, Argentina has barley stocks of about 900,000 tonnes, 70% of which is feed barley and 30% malt, according to Baque's estimates.

(Reuters) -  Unilever  (NYSE:UL) proposed collapsing its Anglo-Dutch legal structure into a single holding company based in Britain on Thursday, nearly two years after shareholders sank an earlier plan to move its headquarters to the Netherlands.
The maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise said in a statement that unification, which would unwind a dual-headed structure in place since 1930, aims to give more flexibility for mergers and acquisitions and reduce complexity.
Its latest plan is the reverse of what it proposed in 2018, a move which was ultimately dropped in the face of a disruptive UK shareholder revolt at Unilever, which has since replaced its Dutch chairman and chief executive. 
At the time of the 2018 proposal to incorporate the combined entity in the Netherlands, Unilever was still reeling from an unexpected $143 billion take-over approach from Kraft Heinz (O:KHC), which was dropped after swift rejection from Unilever. 
The new plan, which requires 50% shareholder approval versus 75% before, is the ""best tactical option,"" Unilever's Danish Chairman Nils Andersen told reporters. 
It resulted from an 18-month review and was accelerated in part by a decision to demerge its tea business, Unilever said, adding that this would be harder under its existing structure.
However, Unilever cautioned that the tea review was still underway, and that no deal was imminent.
The unification would be achieved through a cross-border merger, with shareholders of Dutch Unilever NV (AS:UNA) getting one share of British Unilever Plc (L:ULVR) for each share held.
""It makes sense for the company to have as flexible an operational structure as possible, and this appears to achieve it without any obvious downside,"" Steve Clayton, UK fund manager of the  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) Select Fund range, which own Unilever shares, said of the proposal.
DUTCH REGRET
Shares in Unilever Plc were down 0.6% at 4349 pence, erasing earlier gains, while the Dutch shares were up 1.1%.
Unilever, which will remain listed on the Amsterdam and London stock exchanges, also said it will not change its British or Dutch operations, locations, activities or staffing.
The move was welcomed by Britain's business minister Alok Sharma, who said it represented ""a vote of confidence"" in the country, which this year left the European Union.
But while Unilever promised to raise investment in the Netherlands and continue to base its Foods and Refreshment (F&R) division headquarters there, there was Dutch disappointment. 
""We regret this proposal as we would rather have seen a simplification with a Dutch company at the head,"" Economy Minister Eric Wiebes wrote to parliament. 

Unilever's F&R division, which represents about 40% of group sales or 20 billion euros ($23 billion) annually, is behind brands such as Knorr soup and Magnum ice-cream.

Lee over a 2015 merger and alleged accounting fraud, the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office said on Thursday.
The planned panel's recommendations could help pave the way for Lee's attorneys to challenge the legality of the prosecution's claims. 
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office will form the panel composed of 15 experts from fields including legal circles, academia and civic groups, the ministry of government legislation said.
Attorneys for Lee said in a statement that they welcome the decision to form the outside panel. 
""It's similar to a grand jury system in the United States, allowing citizens to determine if there is enough evidence to move forward with charges against Lee,"" a criminal defence lawyer told Reuters, requesting anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. 
The committee can offer recommendations in the case, but prosecutors are not legally bound to follow its findings. 
""If the committee concludes that prosecutors don't seem to have enough reasoning or evidence, that could land prosecutors in hot water, because they don't want to look like they are overcharging Lee if they decide to eventually indict him despite the panel's suggestions,"" the lawyer added. 
A Seoul court on Tuesday denied an arrest warrant request for Lee, who is vice chairman of Samsung Electronics (KS:005930), after prosecutors accused him of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.
Prosecutors last week asked the court to issue an arrest warrant for the 51-year-old Lee, as part of a probe into alleged accounting fraud involving a Samsung drugs affiliate and a 2015 merger of two other affiliates.
They claimed that fraudulent accounting and alleged stock manipulation helped facilitate Lee's plan to assume greater control over the Samsung Group. Lee's attorneys have denied the allegations. 

Lee was jailed for about a year until his release in February 2018 for his role in a bribery scandal. He was accused of giving horses to the daughter of a confidante of former South Korean President Park Geun-hye to win government support for the merger of the two affiliates.

DUBAI (Reuters) - United Arab Emirates carrier flydubai has indefinitely extended the period of reduced pay for employees and placed dozens of pilots on unpaid leave for a year, company sources said.
The airline had temporarily cut salaries for three months from April, which an employee had said reduced wages of pilots and engineers by half and cabin crew pay by a quarter.
It extended the pay cut and placed some pilots on unpaid leave in effort to preserve cash, two sources said.
Pilots could be recalled to paid work early if needed, they said.
The airline has operated few, limited passenger flights since March when it grounded services due to the global coronavirus pandemic.
A flydubai spokeswoman said that staff had been offered unpaid leave and that the airline was talking to some pilots and cabin crew about their future but declined to comment further.
""The decisions we have had to take have not been taken lightly and we will extend our full support,"" she said.
Aviation is one of the industries worst hit by the virus outbreak, with airlines around the world laying off staff and seeking government bailouts.
Sister carrier Emirates laid off hundreds of pilots and thousands of cabin crew this week as it tries to stave off its own cash crunch, sources have said. 
Further job losses at Emirates were expected on Thursday, though scheduled meetings where staff were to be told they had been made redundant were later cancelled, three company sources said.

Emirates did not immediately respond to questions about cancelling the meetings.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Airlines don't need to compensate passengers if a flight is delayed by one person biting another as it is an ""extraordinary circumstance"", the EU's top court ruled on Thursday after a customer sued Portuguese airline TAP over such an incident.
However, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg called on carriers to ensure passengers are re-routed as soon as possible, either via direct or indirect flights on other airlines, to absolve themselves from such claims.
""The unruly behaviour of an air passenger may constitute an 'extraordinary circumstance' capable of exempting the carrier from its obligation to pay compensation for the cancellation or long delay of the flight concerned, or of a subsequent flight operated by that carrier using the same aircraft,"" judges said.
The ruling came after a traveller sued Transportes Aereos Portugueses (TAP) for compensation after the departure of his flight from Brazil to Portugal in August 2017 was delayed, causing him to miss a connecting flight to Norway.
The TAP plane left Brazil late because it had been diverted on its way there to disembark a passenger who was biting other people on board and assaulting crew members.
The court said re-routing the passenger on the next flight operated by TAP was a reasonable measure that released the airline from its obligation to pay cash compensation, even if the passenger arrived a day after his initial schedule.

TAP said the flight arrived late in Lisbon because it had used the same plane that was diverted to disembark the violent passenger on its way to Brazil and it was impossible to send another aircraft on time.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>","SoftBank buyback puts financial rigour in question, says S&P","By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - Credit-rating firm S&P Global Ratings on Thursday questioned SoftBank Group Corp's financial discipline as the tech conglomerate pursues a massive 2.5 trillion yen ($24 billion) share buyback program in volatile markets. 
The buyback plan raises doubts about its intention to adhere to ""financial soundness and creditworthiness"", S&P said, with SoftBank looking to raise up to $41 billion via asset sales. 
CEO Masayoshi Son's move to monetize key parts of his portfolio have already caused a public spat with Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service after it slashed the group's junk rating and questioned the viability of the plan.
Buybacks have helped SoftBank's shares, which are used by Son as collateral for loans, climb 92% off lows struck in March despite SoftBank in May reporting a record annual loss as investments via its $100 billion Vision Fund flounder.
S&P revised its outlook for SoftBank to negative in March but stopped short of a downgrade of the current junk BB+ rating. 
The group's loan-to-value ratio, a key measure of indebtedness, has likely jumped to 30-35%, S&P said on Thursday, approaching the 40% level that would trigger a downgrade.
The impact of asset sales, which could improve the ratio by 5%, were not factored into that calculation.
SoftBank frequently emphasises its adherence to internal financial rules including retaining enough cash to cover bond redemptions for two years. 
The group is raising 1.25 trillion yen from its stake in  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding, which has an A+ rating from S&P, along with further funds from stakes in wireless carriers SoftBank Corp and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS). 
The value of the portfolio is in a few big assets and, while the credit impact of Vision Fund's losses are limited, it underscores the ""low quality of some assets"" and ""strong risk appetite"", S&P said. 
At the end of April SoftBank had spent 250 billion yen on buybacks, which have been sought by activist investor Elliott Management.

The airline has come under fire from British politicians for plans to cut 12,000 jobs. But with planes grounded and no revenue, it says the job losses are necessary because travel demand is set to shrink in coming years.
The BA collection includes works by Damien Hirst, Peter Doig and Bridget Riley, and selling off some of the works, which usually hang in executive lounges at airports, was an idea from a BA staff member, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday. 
At least one work has been valued at more than 1 million pounds ($1.27 million), the source added. 
BA boss Alex Cruz said last week that with its parent company IAG (L:ICAG) burning through 178 million pounds ($223 million) a week, he could not guarantee BA's survival and urged unions to engage over the job cuts.
The airline has said it is taking steps now to reduce up to 28% of staff numbers to protect as many jobs as it can in the long term.

226,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>","Stocks spooked, bonds rally on downbeat Fed","By Marc Jones and Wayne Cole
LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares took their biggest tumble in five weeks on Thursday as a sobering outlook from the U.S. Federal Reserve challenged market optimism on the global economy, while bonds rallied on bets yet more stimulus would be needed to ensure recovery.
Asia saw a 10-day winning streak come to an abrupt finish (T) and Europe's main bourses all opened with a heavy thud. 
London's FTSE, Frankfurt's DAX and Paris's CAC40 were all down more than 2.5% in what for coronavirus-sensitive sectors such as carmakers and travel and tourism was a fourth straight day of drops. 
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s 49-country index of world stocks slid 0.75% in its largest daily loss in five weeks, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 fell 1.5% to extend the previous session's pullback on Wall Street. 
In a reality check to the stock market's recent euphoria, the Fed predicted the U.S. economy would shrink 6.5% in 2020 and unemployment would still be at 9.3% at year's end.
Data had also shown core U.S. consumer prices fell for a third straight month in May, the longest stretch of declines on record.
As a result, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he was ""not even thinking about thinking about raising rates"". Instead, he emphasised recovery would be a long road and that policy would have to be proactive with rates near zero out to 2022.
""While Powell did not commit to any new action at this time, his focus on downside risk and uncertainty reinforces the message that they will take further action, probably by September,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) economists said.
""Outcome or calendar-based guidance looks likely and Powell left the door open for moving to some form of interest rate caps.""
Powell confirmed the Fed was studying yield curve control, a form of easing already employed by Japan and Australia.
All of which saw yields on 10-year Treasuries fall 9 basis points on Wednesday, the biggest daily drop in almost two months. Yields were down at 0.71% on Thursday, a sharp rally from last week's peak of 0.96%. 
German Bund yields - the benchmark for Europe - duly followed. Their 10-year levels fell to an eight-day low in early trade at -0.37%, falling 4 basis points on the day. 
The risk of more Fed easing initially had the U.S. dollar under pressure, seeing it touch a three-month low against a basket of currencies at 95.714.
But it then staged a rebound back towards 96.500 as risk appetite waned and stocks came off. 
Market sentiment also took a hit as new coronavirus infections in the United States showed a slight increase after five weeks of declines, only part of which was attributed to more testing.
Eric Toner, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said that ""There is a new wave coming in parts of the country. It's small and it's distant so far, but its coming."" 
The dollar was last at 107.20 yen, after hitting a one-month trough at 106.87. The euro edged back to $1.1360, having hit its highest since mid-March on Wednesday at $1.1422.
The prospect of super-low rates for longer had been a boon for gold overnight, but it too had run into selling in Asia, slipping to $1,728 an ounce. 
Oil prices also turned lower amid renewed concerns about demand and after U.S. data showed crude inventories had risen to record highs. 

Brent crude futures fell $1.56 or 3.7% to $40.15 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost $1.57 to $38.03.

227,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>",How Uber hailed a deal with Grubhub only to let it slip,"By Krystal Hu and Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has spent much of his career deftly negotiating acquisitions. Yet his $6.5 billion all-stock bid for  Grubhub Inc  (N:GRUB) ended with the food delivery company being acquired by European rival Just Eat Takeway.com NV (AS:TKWY).
A former Allen & Co investment banker, Khosrowshahi courted Grubhub for more than a year, and agreed a price in principle last month for an acquisition that would have boosted its Uber Eats division and given it an edge over rival Doordash, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Khosrowshahi and Grubhub's founder and CEO Matt Maloney had settled on a stock exchange ratio of 1.925 shares of Uber for each share of Grubhub, the sources said. 
Left unresolved was a plan to get the deal approved by regulators, the sources added. Uber and Grubhub combined would account for more than half the U.S. food delivery market, according to some analysts' estimates. The deal would almost certainly draw scrutiny from antitrust officials and politicians wary of big mergers that could lead to job cuts, as the economy reels from the COVID-19 pandemic's fallout. 
That is when the negotiations stumbled. Uber refused to commit in advance to specific concessions it would make to regulators and politicians to see the deal through, according to sources close to Grubhub. From Uber's perspective, it was Grubhub that refused to address practices that could become issues in a regulatory review, such as its charges to restaurants and the ""cybersquatting"" of internet domains, according to sources close to the ride-hailing giant. 
The two companies could also not agree on the breakup fee that Uber would pay Grubhub were regulators to shoot down the deal, sources close to both companies said.
Other issues came up as well. Maloney wanted to head Uber's new food delivery division, a role Khosrowshahi intended for Uber Eats chief Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, a source close to Uber said.
Just Eat Takeway.com seized on the impasse. After media reports of the talks between Uber and Grubhub surfaced last month, its founder and CEO Jitse Groen approached with his own all-stock offer, the sources said. Uber, believed to be Grubhub's sole suitor, was taken by surprise, the sources said.
With a market capitalization of $60 billion, Uber was well positioned to outbid Just Eat Takeway.com, which has a market capitalization of $15 billion. 
Yet Khosrowshahi, who previously led online travel agency  Expedia  Group Inc (O:EXPE) and built it up through a string of dealmaking, decided that Grubhub was one acquisition he should let go, even if this created a stronger competitor. He viewed Grubhub as unresponsive to Uber's efforts to hammer out a roadmap for getting the deal approved by regulators, two of the sources said. 
In an Uber board meeting on Wednesday, Khosrowshahi agreed that the company should drop its pursuit. Just Eat Takeway.com inked a $7.3 billion deal with Grubhub later that day. Uber is not planning to come back with a new offer, the sources said.
""Like ridesharing, the food delivery industry will need consolidation in order to reach its full potential for consumers and restaurants. That doesn't mean we are interested in doing any deal, at any price, with any player,"" Uber said in a statement. 

Grubhub and Just Eat Takeway.com did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Investing.com - European stock markets slumped Thursday, as the gloomy assessment of the economic outlook by the U.S. Federal Reserve prompted investors to take profits after the sector’s strong run.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.8% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 3%, the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 2.6%, while the broad-based Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 2.5%.
European equities have undergone a hefty rally from the depths of the coronavirus crisis, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index posting gains of over 30% from its March lows.
However, the downbeat assessment of the economic outlook of the world’s largest economy by the Federal Reserve, its first since the coronavirus outbreak, has prompted broad profit taking.
“Overall, the Fed thinks the road to recovery has begun, but it is a long run. And it is not V-shaped one,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note to clients.
Many of the decliners Thursday are those stocks which were very hard hit at the start of the coronavirus-inspired declines, including airline Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), travel agent Tui (DE:TUIGn) and retailer  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn).
Elsewhere, Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) rose 1.3% after announcing its $7.3 billion deal to buy U.S. meal-delivery service GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB). Just Eat had dropped 13% on Wednesday as The Wall Street Journal had reported the deal was close. 
Additionally, eye will be on the Eurogroup meeting later Thursday, where the region’s finance ministers are expected to discuss the EU recovery fund. 
“Given the differences between the EU commission and e.g. the Netherlands and Austria, the proposal for the recovery fund needs some work before it can be passed in the various parliaments,” said Danske Bank, in a research note.
Oil prices slumped Thursday, weighed by the Fed’s grim assessment of the economic outlook as well as increased fears of a supply glut.
U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 5.72 million barrels last week to 538.1 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration forecast late Wednesday, against expectations of a 1.738 million-barrel draw.
EIA’s call followed the American Petroleum Institute prediction of a whopping 8.4 million-barrel build on Tuesday, increasing fears of an oversupply.
At 4:05 AM ET, WTI Futures traded 3.8% lower at $38.11 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 3.4% to $40.33.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1.3% to $1,743.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1370, largely unchanged.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",Europe's Just Eat Takeaway to buy Grubhub for $7.3 billion,"By Toby Sterling and Greg Roumeliotis
AMSTERDAM/NEW YORK (Reuters) - European food-ordering firm Just Eat Takeaway.com NV said on Wednesday it had agreed to buy U.S. peer Grubhub Inc in an all-stock deal that, if completed, would create the world's largest food delivery company outside China.
The deal would create ""a company built around four of the world's largest profit pools in food delivery: the U.S., the UK, the Netherlands and Germany,"" the companies said in a joint statement. 
For Grubhub, the deal offers an escape from the antitrust concerns that plagued its talks with the Uber Eats division of ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc.
Uber approached Chicago-based Grubhub in May for an all-stock deal that fell apart this week. In a statement, Uber said the food delivery industry needs consolidation, but ""that doesn't mean we are interested in doing any deal, at any price, with any player.""
Media reports about the Uber offer prompted Just Eat Takeaway to reach out with its own offer, Grubhub CEO Matt Maloney told Reuters in a phone interview. 
Dutch-based Takeaway had acquired Just Eat in January for $7.8 billion. 
Maloney has known Just Eat Takeaway's billionaire Chief Executive Jitse Groen since 2007, and both companies have similar models based around being a marketplace for customers to find restaurants and order from them, Maloney said. 
The European firm presented an offer ""at a price that made the decision very easy,"" Maloney said. The deal also provides Grubhub ""financial strength and flexibility.""
Grubhub's stock price rose nearly 6% in aftermarket trading and Just Eat Takeaway shares closed more than 13% lower in Amsterdam after the companies disclosed they were in talks in the late afternoon.
Experts say consolidation is long overdue in the U.S. restaurant delivery sector, where demand is surging, especially as many people stay home to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Just Eat Takeaway said it expects to close the deal in the first quarter of 2021, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.
Chris Sagers, who teaches at Ohio's Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, said a deal between Grubhub and Just Eat Takeaway should win easy approval from U.S. antitrust enforcers.
The combined company will be headquartered in Amsterdam.
The companies said in a presentation that Just Eat Takeaway had 2019 revenues of 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion), compared with Grubhub's 1.2 billion euros.
In a trading update, the companies said that order growth was up 41% across the companies' main markets in April and May, as the coronavirus outbreak led to a surge in use of online food services.
Groen founded Takeaway in 2000 while still a student and oversaw its growth through a series of acquisitions, including a 2018 deal to buy the German operations of rival Delivery Hero.
Groen owns a 10.29% stake in Just Eat Takeaway ahead of the Grubhub deal.

The U.S. central bank kept its interest rates on hold as it concluded its latest two-day policy meeting late Wednesday, but painted a pretty depressing picture with its first projections on the world’s largest economy since the coronavirus outbreak.

But when transportation services halted under a city lockdown, Aji considered it a good day if he got more than two food delivery orders, which pay him $0.70 each time. On some days, he has had none. Even with restrictions eased this week, he is struggling to feed his family.
""The situation is that there are many drivers but orders are few,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name.
Eleven drivers for Gojek and Grab, which is backed by SoftBank Group (T:9984), in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand told Reuters they've similarly struggled, with income slashed by more than half as the pandemic batters Southeast Asia.
And, disappointingly, for both drivers and the companies, an increase in food deliveries - forecast as a major growth area for both firms - has come nowhere near compensating for the losses in transport.
Even in Vietnam, seen as a recovery success story, drivers are reeling.
""The pandemic may cost me and many colleagues our vehicles, which we had bought using borrowed money,"" said Grab car driver Tung in Hanoi, fearing that lenders may repossess the vehicles.
Unions representing Gojek and larger Singaporean rival Grab, Southeast Asia's most highly valued startup at $14 billion, say thousands of drivers are in the same situation, especially in Indonesia, both firms' largest market.
CORE PROMISE
Their plight threatens a core promise of both companies: that they can improve the lives of tens of millions of people across Southeast Asia even as they provide big paydays for their blue-chip corporate and financial investors.
Southeast Asian governments have warned millions could end up jobless as a result of the outbreak.
The two firms told Reuters they are supporting drivers with measures ranging from food packages and vouchers to low-interest bank loans and car rental rebates. But the crisis has also led them to cut the subsidies that have fueled their growth.
Doubts have also crept up about the ride-hailing model globally and on whether investors will continue pumping in massive funds into the startups.
Even before the pandemic, Grab and Gojek - like Uber (N:UBER) and  Lyft  (O:LYFT) in the United States and other ride-hailing firms around the world - were operating at a steep loss.
Grab co-founder Tan Hooi Ling has warned the company may potentially face a ""long winter"".
Both companies still have plenty of cash. One source with knowledge of the matter said Grab has $3 billion in reserves. Sources familiar with Gojek's finances said it was finalising an over $3 billion investment round at a $10 billion valuation; Facebook (O:FB) and Paypal (O:PYPL) announced investments in Gojek's fintech arm just last week, and it also counts Google (O:GOOGL) and Tencent (HK:0700) among its backers.
Each has avoided major layoffs so far, though Grab is implementing voluntary unpaid leave for staff and Gojek is reviewing its services. In the United States, Uber, whose Southeast Asia business was bought by Grab, said it would cut 23% of its workforce.
""Transport has fallen off a cliff, food has held steady, while logistics went through the roof and online payments are high... so having a portfolio of products helps,"" said Gojek Chief Operating Officer Hans Patuwo. ""If we were only a transport company, I'd be quite bowled over.""
Executives and investors at both firms point to the resurgence of orders at Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing as cause for optimism.
""The rate of recovery will be mostly dependent on when government lockdowns end,"" said Grab Operations Managing Director Russell Cohen, noting Grab's transport business had previously been profitable in several markets.
The crisis has revived speculation among investors about a merger of the two firms, which sources say has been discussed in early 2020, but not led to serious talks.
Gojek said any reports of a merger are inaccurate. A Grab spokesman declined to comment.
FOOD DELIVERY
Grab and Gojek have long touted the fast-growing food delivery industry as a big opportunity. But with platforms taking only a 20%-30% commission that is shared with drivers, margins are slim. And growth did not materialise in every market during the lockdowns.
A restaurant chain CEO in Jakarta said food delivery had not picked up in Southeast Asia's largest economy due to people cooking more at home and as most orders traditionally consisted of lunches for office workers, who are now at home.
Aji described food delivery in Indonesia for Gojek as a ""fight"", with ""sometimes 50 drivers for one order"", with Grab Vietnam drivers recounting similar experiences.
Even in Thailand, where orders jumped for both Grab and Gojek, profitability remains distant.
According to an April interview with local media by then Grab Thailand chief Tarin Thaniyavarn, food delivery was fast-growing but loss-making during the pandemic, with costs mounting and competition steep.
Tarin said Grab Thailand lost more than $22 million in 2018, while rapid growth led to losses nearly doubling in 2019.

""Imagine last year’s loss-making business growing rapidly in a short period of time, while the business that used to make profits for us is nearly gone,"" he said.

The haven pushed higher after Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed is committed to “do whatever we can, for as long as it takes,” speaking after policy makers held the benchmark rate near zero on Wednesday. Almost all officials forecast keeping rates near zero through 2022, and the central bank also said it will at least maintain the current rate of bond purchases.
Bullion’s advanced 14% in 2020 as virus-related lockdowns savaged growth and spurred unprecedented stimulus. The OECD forecast a slump of 6% in the global economy this year, a deeper contraction than the World Bank had predicted. Meanwhile, America’s top infectious-disease specialist warned the outbreak is far from over, after Texas, Florida and California all reported worrying trends.
“The reason that ultra-loose monetary policy is a positive for gold is that it applies downward pressure to long-term U.S. real yields,” Vivek Dhar, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), said in an email. That “effectively increases the appeal of the precious metal relative to U.S.-interest earning assets.”
Futures rose as much as 1.7% to $1,749.80 an ounce on the Comex, and traded at $1,745.10 at 8:52 a.m. in Singapore. Spot gold was a little weaker after climbing 1.4% on Wednesday as Treasury yields fell along with the dollar.
Ahead of this week’s Fed meeting,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). forecast bullion would rise to $1,800 an ounce over 12 months. That’s above the peak in futures earlier this year of $1,788.80, which was the highest since 2012.

""We have made the decision to discontinue placing multicultural hair care and beauty products in locked cases,"" the company said in an email statement on Wednesday.
Walmart said the practice was in place in about a dozen of its 4,700 stores in the United States and the cases were in place to deter shoplifters from products such as electronics, automotive, cosmetics and other personal care products.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Thursday morning, after the U.S. Federal Reserve painted a grim picture of the U.S. recovery from the COVID-19 virus on Wednesday as it wrapped up its policy meeting.
Its quarterly predictions pointed to a long road towards recovery, with GDP forecast to contract by 6.5% in 2020 and unemployment to fall to 9.3% in the final three months of the year from May’s 13.3%.
The picture soured investor sentiment, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 1.25% by 10:55 PM ET (3:55 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI falling 0.14%.
Down Under, the ASX 200 slid 2.19%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.39%. Meanwhile, China’s NetEase (HK:9999) made a soaring debut into the Hong Kong market, with shares rising to above 9% of their issue price on the first day of trading.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.12% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.27%.
The Fed also decided during the meeting to hold its policy benchmark near zero, with official forecasts largely predicting it to stay there through 2022.

242,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 10:20PM ET</span>",Amazon pauses police use of its facial recognition tech for a year,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Ayanti Bera
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Wednesday said it was implementing a one-year moratorium on police use of its facial recognition software, halting a business it long defended as many protested law enforcement brutality against people of color.
The decision culminates a two-year battle between Amazon and civil liberties activists, who have voiced concern that inaccurate matches could lead to unjust arrests.
The death of George Floyd, a black man who died under the knee of a white police officer last month, has fanned worries that facial recognition would be used unfairly against protesters.
Critics have pointed to a past study showing Amazon's ""Rekognition"" service struggled to identify the gender of individuals with darker skin, research that Amazon has contested.
The company, which sells cloud computing technology via its Amazon Web Services division, said in a statement it has pushed for regulations to ensure the software was used ethically. 
""We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested,"" Amazon said.
Congress has been weighing possible regulation of the technology for months. On Monday,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) wrote lawmakers to say it no longer is offering facial recognition generally, while rival  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) has turned down some sales and backed regulations but not a moratorium.
Nicole Ozer, technology and civil liberties director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, gave Amazon credit while calling for a more ""blanket"" moratorium. 
""Face recognition technology gives governments the unprecedented power to spy on us,"" Ozer said in a statement. ""We urge Microsoft and other companies to join IBM, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon in moving towards the right side of history.""
Microsoft spokespeople did not immediately answer a request for comment.
Amazon, due to its prominence and defense of facial recognition, has faced the brunt of criticism, giving symbolic significance to its announcement. Still, firms such as Idemia and NEC Corp are known to have more facial recognition government business. Private-sector sales of Rekognition accounted for around $3 million of Amazon's $25.7 billion in cloud revenue in 2018, according to news site The Information.
One law enforcement user of Rekognition said Amazon was ""throwing us under the bus."" Agencies generally have said they use facial recognition for post-crime investigations, not real-time monitoring.
""After over and over again saying that they stand by us and how we use the tech, they are making it seem like all of a sudden they don't think we use it right,"" the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Amazon said it would continue to permit the technology's use by customers that help law enforcement find human trafficking victims.

244,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lilly COVID-19 treatment could be authorized for use as soon as September - chief scientist,"By Carl O'Donnell and Michael Erman
(Reuters) - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co could have a drug specifically designed to treat COVID-19 authorized for use as early as September if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing, its chief scientist told Reuters on Wednesday.
Lilly is also doing preclinical studies of a third antibody treatment for the illness caused by the new coronavirus that could enter human clinical trials in the coming weeks, Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky said in an interview.
Lilly has already launched human trials with two of the experimental therapies.
The drugs belong to a class of biotech medicines called monoclonal antibodies widely used to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and many other conditions. A monoclonal antibody drug developed against COVID-19 is likely to be more effective than repurposed medicines currently being tested against the virus.
Skovronsky said the therapies - which may also be used to prevent the disease - could beat a vaccine to widespread use as a COVID-19 treatment, if they prove effective. 
""For the treatment indication, particularly, this could go pretty fast,"" he said in an interview. ""If in August or September we're seeing the people who got treated are not progressing to hospitalization, that would be powerful data and could lead to emergency use authorization.""
""So that puts you in the fall time: September, October, November is not unreasonable,"" he said.
Coronavirus vaccines being developed and tested at unprecedented speed are not likely to be ready before the end of the year at the earliest.
Earlier this month, Lilly announced it had initiated patient testing for two separate antibody treatments. One currently designated LY-CoV555 is being developed in partnership with Canadian biotech AbCellera. The other, JS016, it being developed with Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Junshi Biosciences.
Both work by blocking part of the virus’ so-called spike protein that it uses to enter human cells and replicate. 
Lilly's third antibody treatment candidate acts on a different part of the virus and will most likely be tested in combination with one or both of the others, Skovronsky said. 
The drugmaker, however, said it has a strong preference to develop a treatment that can work well in COVID-19 patients as a stand alone, as manufacturing these type of drugs, which are typically administered by infusion, is a complex process and capacity is limited. 
""It's good to have two antibodies. The downside is that manufacturing is precious. We have limited manufacturing capacity. If two antibodies are required, half as many people will get treated,"" Skovronsky said. ""So our goal is to see if we can do one antibody at as low a dose as possible."" 
Lilly will have the capacity to make hundreds of thousands of doses by the end of the year if it can treat COVID-19 patients using a single antibody drug rather than with a combination, he said.
Preventing the disease with these type of drugs presents a different manufacturing challenge entirely.
""Global capacity for antibodies is just not high enough that we could ever think about adequate doses"" for ""billions of people in the prophylactic setting,"" Skovronsky said.
The better solution is to widely inoculate people with COVID-19 vaccines when available, and reserve antibody treatments for people who have the disease or were recently exposed to it.
They could also help vulnerable populations where vaccines are less effective, such as nursing home patients, he said.
Lilly hopes to conduct a COVID-19 prevention clinical trial in nursing home patients later this year, he added.
The Indianapolis-based drugmaker plans to produce the medicines in plants in Kinsale, Ireland and New Jersey, and is willing to use its capacity to help manufacture another company's successful treatment, should Lilly's fail in clinical trails.
Lilly is continuing to screen for antibodies through its partnership with AbCellera, which is working with the U.S. National Institutes of Health to identify promising compounds, Skovronsky said.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 09:21PM ET</span>",U.S. companies vow to fight racism but face critics on diversity,"By Ross Kerber, Helen Coster and Arriana McLymore
(Reuters) - In the past, U.S. corporations have largely remained silent as protests erupted over killings of African-Americans by police officers. That changed with the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which has set off a flurry of corporate statements of solidarity with the black community – along with pledges of more than $1.7 billion to advance racial justice and equity.
The unprecedented outpouring of support, however, has stirred up criticism along with praise. Many social justice advocates, corporate diversity experts and investors say companies also need to focus on equity in their own ranks, especially by hiring and promoting minority workers. 
The tensions show the difficulty executives face in aligning their firms with popular social causes at a time of soaring wealth and inequality – and growing pressure from some investors to show leadership on societal problems. Activists, along with some business leaders, also see an opportunity amid global protests to push reform on social justice issues well beyond police brutality.
The rush of corporate concern belies the reality of workforce inequity, said Natasha Lamb, managing partner of Arjuna Capital. Arjuna is a Boston-based investment adviser and frequent filer of shareholder resolutions pressing companies - with mixed success - to disclose more data on pay equity.
""If you take an honest look at corporate America, outside their glossy diversity reports, structural bias for women and people of color remains as entrenched as ever,"" she said.
Floyd’s death has sparked a movement with wide-ranging goals, said Fiona Ma, California state treasurer and a director for systems managing about $650 billion in state retirement assets. “It’s not just law enforcement” at issue, she said, calling the protests “a greater statement of today’s values and holding people and companies accountable.”
Leaders of major companies including Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA),  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and  Warner Music Group  Corp (O:WMG) have announced major gifts to advance racial justice amid the protests over Floyd's death. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) pledged $1 billion over four years to address economic and racial inequality. At least a dozen other big companies announced gifts between $1 million and $100 million for similar efforts. FACTBOX:
“Our Black community is hurting, and many of us are searching for ways to stand up for what we believe,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL).
Companies’ willingness to take strong stands could signal a substantive shift in the attitudes of corporate leaders, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group, a research and asset management firm. “Some is probably lip service, but I think it goes beyond that, and there's a realization that something needs to change,” Paulsen said.
DIFFERENT THIS TIME
Companies were mostly silent during protests in 2014 following the death of Michael Brown, who was shot by a Ferguson, Missouri policeman, and Eric Garner, who died after being put in a chokehold by a New York City officer.
Today the demonstrations are bigger and more racially diverse. Companies also face increasing pressure from investors, consumers and workers to lead on issues from climate change to gun control to immigration policy and racial inequity.
“It’s good for their own employees to hear this, because especially their younger employees are part of a generational group that cares more about these issues,” said Francis Byrd, a corporate governance consultant in New York.
The growing corporate involvement may also reflect a shift in public attitudes on race, said R. Paul Herman, chief executive of sustainable ratings agency HIP Investor. In the past, he said, companies avoided weighing in on racial controversies for fear of alienating customers. A Monmouth University poll released on June 2 showed the proportion of Americans who consider racial discrimination to be a big problem has increased from about half in 2015 to about 3 in 4 now. 
On June 1,  Facebook Inc  (N:FB) Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his personal Facebook page: “To help in this fight, I know Facebook needs to do more to support equality and safety.”
Facebook committed $10 million to groups working on racial justice, and Zuckerberg's private philanthropy has donated far more to the cause.
But the firm still faces pressure on workplace diversity. At its May 27 annual meeting, investors cast about 28% of votes, excluding shares held by insiders, in favor of a resolution sponsored by Arjuna that called for a breakdown of its median pay gaps by gender and race.
Facebook opposed the measure, saying it already discloses data showing that women and men are equally paid for similar work. A spokesman did not comment on whether it might add more pay disclosures but said the company is committed to workplace equity.
African-Americans make up less than 4% of Facebook’s workforce and about 3% of its senior leadership, compared to 13% of the U.S. populace, according to company disclosures. Other major technology firms, including Google,  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR),  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), have disclosed similarly low proportions of African-American workers and senior managers, relative to the population.
Twitter, Intel and Microsoft representatives said the firms have set ambitious goals to increase the proportion of underrepresented minorities in their ranks.
Google spokeswoman Jennifer Rodstrom said the company would need to “work to expand the talent pool externally, and improve our culture internally, if we want to create equitable outcomes and inclusion for everyone.”
Monica  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN), a Washington, D.C.-based management consultant, said many executives struggle to raise diversity in senior management because they know too few minorities. Leaders need to expand their social and business circles, she said, because referrals are a key source of important hires.
“They need to open their network,” she said. “That’s the work. You can’t cut a check for that.”
Proportions of African-American workers are much higher at firms with large numbers of relatively low-paid workers, such as retailers Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), according to company disclosures. But the higher percentages don’t extend to the senior management ranks of either retailer and remain well below the level of the U.S. population, the disclosures show.
A Walmart spokeswoman cited recent comments from its CEO Doug McMillon that its recruiting and development of African-American employees and other people of color will be “even more of a priority” going forward. Amazon says in a workforce report that it strives “for better representation across our various businesses.”
When Amazon expressed its concern in a May 31 tweet over what it described as the “brutal” treatment of black Americans, it faced immediate blowback over facial-recognition technologies it sells to police agencies. 
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) responded to Amazon’s tweet by asking if it would stop selling technology it says “supercharges police abuse.” In a 2018 study of Amazon’s Rekognition technology, the ACLU found people of color were falsely matched at a high rate. Matt Cagle, an attorney for the ACLU of Northern California, called Amazon’s support for racial justice “utterly hypocritical.”
Amazon pledged $10 million for social justice causes, some of which will go to the ACLU Foundation. The ACLU welcomed the donation, said Ben Wizner, director of its Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.
“Since it is an unrestricted gift, the irony is that some of this money will undoubtedly be used to hold Amazon accountable for its role in perpetuating police abuses,” he said.
Amazon has defended Rekognition and said all users must follow laws limiting its use. But late Wednesday, hours after this Reuters report was published, Amazon announced it would put a one-year moratorium on police use of Rekognition.
""We’ve advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology,"" the company said on its website. ""We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules."" 
FEW AFRICAN-AMERICANS IN MANAGEMENT
Reuters reviewed available data on workplace diversity from 27 large corporations that made statements about race in the wake of Floyd’s death. The data is spotty, however, because companies are not legally required to release it and their disclosures can be selective.
The percentage of black board members often mirrors or surpasses that of the broader U.S. population, the company disclosures showed. But the percentage of black employees in senior management is typically much lower. More than half of the 27 companies disclosed percentages of African-Americans in their top ranks that were less than half the percentage in the broader population, and many companies disclosed no racial breakdown for managers at all.
At the Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS), none of the 15 senior executives listed on the company’s website are black; Disney’s recently-named treasurer is Hispanic. A Disney spokesman cited company diversity efforts including two programs announced last year that aim to attract and develop talent from underrepresented backgrounds.
The company on June 3 announced a $5 million pledge to support nonprofit organizations that advance social justice, including a $2 million donation to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
Jade Magnus Ogunnaike, Deputy Senior Campaign Director at social justice organization Color of Change – which promotes racial equity through online campaigns - said the donation was a start but that Disney and other firms need to reassess their approach. Ogunnaike said companies should conduct civil rights audits that examine workforce demographics, hiring practices and company culture.
“They're going to have to look intensely and deeply at how racism is showing up,” she said.
James Page, Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion at General Assembly, a technology training firm, said companies looking to show leadership on issues of race need to do more than donate to social justice organizations. 

“This crisis did not occur because the NAACP didn’t have enough money,” Page said, referring to one of oldest and best-known U.S. civil rights groups. “Corporations now need a clear plan on how they're going to change the makeup of their organizations.”

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is aiming to conduct a key certification test flight on its grounded 737 MAX jet in late June, two people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. Boeing told airlines it hopes to conduct the flight in late June, the sources said.
Boeing did not comment on the certification flight timing, but said late Wednesday it had won approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for a service bulletin that details the modifications required for 737 MAX wiring.
""Boeing has already begun modifying airplanes that have not yet been delivered and is coordinating modification efforts with the airlines,"" the company said. ""New airplanes being built will include this update,"" it added.
In March, Reuters first reported Boeing would separate 737 MAX wiring bundles, flagged by regulators as potentially dangerous, before the jet returns to service.
Boeing also said it had shared with airlines ""draft pilot training materials and related information to help operators facilitate and plan the development of their training programs.""
Reuters has previously reported that the FAA does not plan to clear Boeing for a resumption of 737 MAX flights until at least August. 
The sources warned the date could slip into July for the certification test flight, as the dates for many milestones for returning the plane to service have been repeatedly pushed back.
The FAA said on Wednesday it was ""in regular contact with Boeing as the company continues its work on the 737 MAX. ... The aircraft will be cleared for return to passenger service only after the FAA is satisfied that all safety-related issues are addressed.""
In early April, Boeing confirmed it would make two new software updates to the 737 MAX’s flight control computer. But Boeing said software issues that prompted the updates were unrelated to a key anti-software system known as MCAS faulted in both fatal crashes.
Boeing resumed production of the 737 MAX on May 27 after halting it in January.

Bloomberg News reported the communication to airlines earlier Wednesday.

Lufthansa last week pledged a wide-ranging restructuring, from thousands of job cuts to asset sales, as it seeks to repay a 9 billion euro ($10.26 billion) state bailout and navigate deepening losses in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
It said then that job cuts would be ""significantly more"" than the 10,000 figure it had previously estimated.
The company is trying to reach agreement with labour unions to make employees work part-time and other ways to cut personnel costs before it holds an extraordinary general meeting on June 25, when shareholders will vote on the bailout.
Flight attendants union UFO demanded that Lufthansa commits to avoiding forced redundancies, but said it was working hard to reach a deal by the time of the meeting.

Meanwhile, the union representing pilots said its members had offered to take a cut in pay of up to 45%, in total amounting to about 350 million euros, but in return it wants the company to try to secure as many jobs as possible.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian stocks were set to fall on Thursday after gloomy economic projections from the U.S. Federal Reserve sent the greenback and most Wall Street shares lower.
Fed officials at their policy meeting on Wednesday said U.S. gross domestic product is expected to decline 6.5% this year. They also flagged the need to keep the key interest rate near zero through at least 2022.
""The Fed is basically saying they're going to keep the system solvent and at the macro level there's no room for failures but at the micro level there'd be some businesses that won't survive,"" said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner at Harris Financial Group.
Australian S&P/ASX 200 futures were down 1.08%, while {{178|Japan's NiNikkei 225 futures fell 1.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures were 0.31% lower.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones benchmarks both moved between gains and losses after the Fed statement, which was the first projections from the U.S. central bank on the economy since the coronavirus outbreak.
An S&P index of bank shares, which tend to benefit from rising rates, fell 5.8% in its biggest daily percentage decline since April 15, and the S&P 500 financial index was the biggest drag on the benchmark index.
""The broad downgrade in banking stocks came as the market wasn't sure what the extent of their loan loss provisions would be,"" Cox said.
The Nasdaq benchmark, however, continued its record-breaking rally for the third consecutive session helped by gains in shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with investors viewing technology as a defensive sector with massive growth opportunities, Cox added.
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.04%, the S&P 500 lost 0.53%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.67%.
The dollar fell to a three-month trough against the euro, sterling and Swiss franc after the Fed's pledge to keep monetary policy loose until the U.S. economy is back on track.
The greenback fell about 0.4% against a basket of major currencies to 95.882 after earlier sliding to 95.714, a level not seen since mid-March.
The euro rose as high as $1.1422 and sterling reached $1.2812, with the dollar hitting a three-month low of 0.9425 franc versus the Swiss currency.
U.S. Treasury yields fell as the Fed promised to maintain monthly bond purchases at ""the current pace"" of about $80 billion in Treasuries and $40 billion in agency and mortgage-backed securities.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell 9 basis points to 0.744%. Two-year yields, which are the most sensitive to rate changes, fell 3 basis points to 0.177%.
Oil rebounded from earlier losses, even as U.S. data showed crude inventories rose to a record high, reviving worries of a persistent glut due to weak demand.
Crude stocks rose by 5.7 million barrels in the week to June 5 to 538.1 million barrels, according to a U.S. Energy Information Administration report. [EIA/S]

Brent crude settled up 55 cents to $41.73 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 66 cents to $39.60 after falling more than 2% in the session.

(Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp (O:NWSA) will need to cut jobs in its British newspaper and radio operations as part of a business review aimed at reducing costs, News UK Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks said in a letter to staff on Wednesday.
""In the coming months, we will need to streamline the business and take some tough decisions, saying goodbye to some valued and talented colleagues,"" Brooks said in the letter seen by Reuters.
The letter did not mention the scale or number of job losses that could occur after the step.
The review has been triggered by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and its resulting lockdown, according to a News UK spokeswoman.
""To secure the future of our brands, in the coming months we will need to streamline the business and take some tough decisions,"" the spokeswoman told Reuters in an emailed statement.
News UK includes the Times of London, The Sunday Times and The Sun newspapers, along with Virgin Radio, talkSPORT and talkRADIO.
The development comes as coronavirus-related shutdowns gut advertising revenues and accelerate a downturn in the media sector in many parts of the world.
The outbreak has accelerated the decline of print advertising and sales. The pressure on traditional media in some parts of the world has been evident for years as advertisers chase the audience reach of internet giants like  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google.
The Australian arm of News Corp said late last month it will stop printing more than 100 regional newspapers, adding that the closures would lead to job cuts.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>",White House works to move stalled airline contact tracing plan: sources,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House wants a plan in place by Sept. 1 for airlines to collect contact tracing information from U.S.-bound international passengers, but will not immediately implement a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) proposal, three people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday.
The Trump administration convened a high-level White House meeting on Tuesday that included Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, and other senior officials. The White House tasked a interagency working group with adopting an interim solution by June 30 and ahead of any potential coronavirus second wave.
A debate over how data should be collected from passengers in order to quickly identify and contact people exposed to the coronavirus has dragged on for months without resolution.
In February, the CDC issued an internal final rule that aimed to require airlines to collect five contact data elements from international passengers and electronically submit them to Customs and Border Protection to facilitate contact tracing.
That has not been enforced. Airlines strongly protested, saying it was unworkable. They argued they could not provide such information, especially from passengers booking tickets through third-party websites.
Airline groups instead backed the setting up of a website and mobile application for passengers to send their contact information directly to the CDC.
The interagency group will work with technical experts at industry association Airlines for America, the CDC and others on an interim solution that could take effect by Sept. 1 and will consider the airline proposal, the sources said.
If no workable plan is identified, the administration will likely move ahead with the existing CDC plan, sources said.
Airlines for America, a group representing American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and others, said earlier this week airlines ""strongly support a contract tracing solution that will provide the most secure data to the U.S. government in a timely and efficient manner.""

The White House and Transportation Department declined to comment. The CDC and DHS did not respond to requests for comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said the question remains open as to whether the U.S. central bank will use yield curve controls, reinforcing market expectations that it is gearing up to do so to stimulate the economy.
As the U.S. economic reopening has prompted a stock market rebound and lifted yields on longer-dated Treasuries, bond market players have argued the Fed may cap yields at specific points on the curve, by buying 2- or 3-year maturities for example, to reinforce its guidance that rates are not going up anytime soon.
In his introductory remarks before Wednesday's post-policy meeting press conference, Powell flagged that policymakers had a full discussion about employing yield curve controls but for now would continue with its current level of purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities.
""Whether such an approach would usefully complement our main tools remains an open question,"" he said. He added that the bank would continue the discussion in upcoming meetings.
""I think they are open to anything and everything but not ready to put (yield curve control) into action. (Powell) wants to save that bullet,"" said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors.
U.S. Treasury yields fell following Powell's remarks, which steepened a part of the yield curve. The spread between the 5- and 30-year yields  widened modestly, last up 1.8 basis points to 119 basis points. The spread between 2- and 10-year yields , the most common measure of the yield curve, however, was narrower by 6.4 basis points.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts said on Wednesday the explicit reference to the study of yield curve control supported a steepening of the 5- to 30-year curve and the meeting in general supported ""the need to hedge for the possibility of higher longer-term rates.""

The retailer said it has taken ""decisive actions to manage liquidity"", including borrowing money, while opening nearly half of its stores across the United States and Canada. 
Shares of the company, down 70% for the year, rose about 17% after the bell.
Apparel retailers have been among the worst hit as their businesses were considered non-essential and their stores had to be closed. They were forced to limit operations to online, which led to furloughing of staff and unpaid leases and rents. 
The pandemic has added to Tailored Brands' woes, as it had already been struggling with competition from fast-fashion brands and a shift to online shopping. 
As of May 2, the company had long-term debt of $1.4 billion and $244.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. 
""If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are protracted and we are unable to increase liquidity ... we may be forced to scale back or terminate operations and/or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws,"" Tailored brands said in a filing. https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/884217/000155837020007429/tlrd-20200610x8k.htm 
First-quarter net sales for the retailer, which also owns men's clothing store Jos. A. Bank, plunged 60.4% as stores were closed due to coronavirus-led nationwide lockdowns.
It said store closures and lack of staff may have disrupted the level of customer service, which could result in decreased demand or customers switching to competitors.

The company, however, said it expects sales to rebuild gradually during the remainder of the year, calling the operating environment highly uncertain.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Aircraft parts maker Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (N:SPR) announced on Wednesday a 21-day layoff for staff doing production and support work for  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) 737 program.
Spirit, which makes the 737 fuselage, said the temporary layoffs and furloughs of roughly 900 workers at its Wichita, Kansas, facility would be effective June 15. The company cited impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty surrounding the 737 MAX's return to service following fatal crashes as reasons for the cuts.
Spirit's announcement comes two weeks after Boeing said it resumed production of the 737 MAX, with a goal of handing jets over to airlines in the third quarter.
The 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. 
Boeing aims to conduct a key certification test flight on the 737 MAX jet in late June, two people briefed on the matter said earlier on Wednesday.

In May, Spirit, Boeing's largest supplier, said its cash flow outlook for the year had worsened as Boeing and key customer Airbus SE (PA:AIR) cut production due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tyson, which was served with a subpoena in April 2019, said the formal grant under the DoJ's corporate leniency program would mean neither the company nor its employees will face criminal fines, jail time or prosecution.
The news comes a week after the chief executive of poultry company Pilgrim's Pride (NASDAQ:PPC) Corp was indicted along with three other current and former industry executives on charges of seeking to fix chicken prices in the United States.
The charges were the first in a criminal probe of price-fixing and bid-rigging involving broiler birds, which account for most chicken meat sold in the United States.

Grocers, retailers and consumers have accused Pilgrim's Pride, Tyson Foods and other poultry processors of conspiring since 2008 to inflate prices for broiler chickens.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state filed civil charges on Wednesday accusing Endo International (NASDAQ:ENDP) Plc of insurance fraud for misrepresenting the safety and efficacy of its opioid drugs, adding fuel to the nation's opioid crisis.
Governor Andrew Cuomo said the charges brought by New York's Department of Financial Services are the second in that regulator's probe into the opioid industry, following similar charges against  Mallinckrodt  (NYSE:MNK) Plc on April 21.
New York said Endo, which made 18.4% of opioids distributed from 2006 to 2014 in the state, downplayed the risks of addiction and abuse of opioids such as its Opana ER, giving patients greater comfort about using them to relieve pain.
It also said Endo knew it was contributing to a ""massive"" surge in opioid prescriptions, leading to payments of fraudulent insurance claims on medically unnecessary prescriptions.
""All these opioid manufacturers knew how addictive and dangerous their products were,"" Cuomo said in a statement. ""Their greedy, fraudulent behavior is inexcusable.""
Endo removed a reformulated Opana ER from the market in July 2017 after a request from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
New York charged Endo with violating two state insurance laws, with civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation. 
Endo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Its shares closed down 66.5 cents, or 14.7%, at $3.845 on the Nasdaq, with most of the decline in late trading after the charges were announced.
The company is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has offices in Malvern, Pennsylvania.
Opioids have contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Endo said in a recent regulatory filing it faced more than 3,200 opioid-related lawsuits, mainly by cities, counties and other municipalities.
The financial services department ordered Endo to attend an Oct. 26 hearing at its offices in Albany, New York.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) said on Wednesday it will recall 2.15 million U.S. vehicles with potentially faulty door latches.
The second largest American automaker said the recall covers many 2011 through 2015 model-year vehicles. The recalled vehicles may not have had all door latches replaced or correctly replaced when repaired by dealerships under recalls issued in 2015 and 2016. 
Ford said a recalled vehicle with a faulty latch may unlatch while driving, but said it is not aware of any reports of accident or injury related to the condition. 
Ford previously recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2015 and has booked hundreds of millions of dollars in costs.
The recall covers some Ford Fiesta (NASDAQ:FRGI), C-Max, Focus, Mustang. Fusion, Escape, Transit Connect, Lincoln MKZ and MKC vehicles.

Ford said the latches have a part susceptible to cracking that in some circumstances can lead to doors failing to close. If motorists repeatedly attempt to close the door, it may temporarily close but could open during driving.

(Reuters) -  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA), a maker of hydrogen-fueled vehicles, is in the process of picking a partner to produce its Badger pickup truck, while also aiming to start deliveries of its electric commercial big rigs next year, founder Trevor Milton said on Wednesday.
Nikola shares have nearly doubled since their debut on the Nasdaq last week, getting a bump on Monday after Milton tweeted that the company would open reservations for Badger on June 29.
""There are three (automakers) in the running right now for a joint venture on Badger, and we will announce who that is in the next few months,"" Milton, who is also the company's executive chairman, told Reuters.
The production of Badger, which will compete with electric car maker Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Cybertruck, is set to start in 2022 or earlier, Milton said. The pickup truck will be available in both electric and fuel-cell versions.
Nikola claims Badger has a range of 600 miles, compared with Cybertruck's range of more than 500 miles.
Milton also said deliveries of its electric commercial trucks, built in partnership with CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI), an Italian-American maker of Iveco trucks, would start in the second half of 2021.
""We are already building prototypes right now on the line in our factory in Ulm, Germany,"" he said.
Nikola's Ulm factory has a capacity to produce 35,000 trucks a year, Milton said. The company will break ground this year for one more factory in Arizona that will produce 35,000 commercial trucks annually.
Nikola is planning to start deliveries of its hydrogen fuel-cell version of the commercial truck, which has a range of up to 750 miles, by the end of 2022.

The rise in Nikola shares this week coincides with Tesla CEO Elon Musk telling his staff on Wednesday that it was time to bring the Tesla Semi commercial truck to ""volume production.""

(Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 ended a choppy session lower on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve reassured investors of its support for the economy but projected a 6.5% decline in gross domestic product this year. 
The Nasdaq, helped by gains in Microsoft (O:MSFT) and Apple (O:AAPL), managed to hold onto a good chunk of its gains and registered a closing record high for a third straight session.
In its latest policy statement, the Fed also forecast a 9.3% unemployment rate at year's end, and officials saw the key overnight interest rate, or federal funds rate, remaining near zero through at least 2022.
The S&P 500 and Dow both moved between gains and losses after the statement, which included the Fed's first projections on the economy since the coronavirus outbreak, and following comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.
""The projections for GDP and for unemployment are that it's going to improve slowly from here, but it still takes a while to get back,"" said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt in Atlanta.
An S&P index of bank shares <.SPXBK>, which tend to benefit from rising rates, fell 5.8% in its biggest daily percentage decline since April 15, and the S&P 500 financial index (SPSY) was the biggest drag on the benchmark index.

The S&P 500 was off as much as 0.8% before the Fed statement.
The Fed's pledge to keep monetary policy loose until the U.S. economy is back on track repeats a promise made early in the central bank's response to the coronavirus pandemic.
""I noticed a material downward move in the banks as (Powell) talked about yield curve control. That is not something the banks want to see. What it does is it keeps rates down,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey. 
Shares of Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) rose late, ending up 1.3%, after its chief scientist told Reuters that it could have a drug specifically designed to treat COVID-19 authorized for use as early as September if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.25-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.86-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 92 new highs and three new lows.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 both fell, while the NASDAQ Composite closed above 10,000 for the first time.
The Fed pointed to the risks to the economy from the Covid-19 pandemic and related business shutdowns.

Initial jobless claims will be released at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) and are estimated to be 1.55 million for the week, down from 1.87 million the prior week, as the overall trend on jobs continues to improve with the reopening of businesses.
Unemployment is still above 13%, according to the government's most recent report, the highest since the post-World War II era. Continuing jobless claims are estimated to come in near 20 million, down from 21.5 million the previous week.
2. Producer Price Index Data Also Being Released.
The Producer Price Index comes out Thursday at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). It measures the change in the price of goods sold by manufacturers and is a leading indicator of consumer price inflation.

Investing.com - The tech-heavy Nasdaq surged to a record close Wednesday, as investors continued to back growth in the wake of Fed's unchanged decision on rates and commitment to stick with stimulus measures.   
{169|Dow Jones Industrial Average}} fell 0.91%, or 247 points, the S&P 500 slipped 0.52%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.67%.
The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged in the range of 0% to 0.25%. The central bank forecasts that low rates will remain through 2022 and pledged to persist with its bond-buying program to ensure an eventual economic recovery will be robust.  
""The committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the Fed said.
Against the backdrop of lower for longer rates, investors continue to opt for growth, pushing tech stocks to record high despite some concerns about frothy valuations in the sector.  
Apple and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) led the gains broader tech sector higher, with the latter ending the day up 4%.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose about 3% as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) raised its price target on the stock to $350 from $320.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>","American, Delta say demand uptick helping cash burn; United requiring health checklists","By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said on Wednesday that a modest recovery in demand was helping to slow daily cash burn rates in June after the U.S. government reported record low passenger numbers in April amid the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. airlines carried 3 million passengers in April, a staggering 96% decline from April 2019, the Transportation Department said on Wednesday. Total U.S. airline passengers were the lowest since 1974 when the government began collecting monthly data. By comparison, there were 76.1 million total U.S. airline passengers in April 2019.
U.S. airlines have grounded nearly half of all airplanes, canceled hundreds of thousands of flights and the industry is still burning through billions a dollars a month. But many airlines are adding back flights in July as demand modestly rebounds.
Speaking to shareholders at the company's annual meeting, American Airlines Chief Executive Doug Parker said while passenger numbers are improving, they are ""still a fraction of what they were last year and particularly internationally.""
That makes it difficult to know how many flights it will operate in the fall, when U.S. payroll aid for airlines runs out, and in the summer of 2021.
Still, American and Delta each said their daily cash burn rate was expected to slow to about $40 million in June. American had previously forecast a $50 million-per-day cash burn.
Delta forecast a 90% plunge in second-quarter revenue and warned it would need to renegotiate its debt agreements to avoid a default next year.
To restore confidence in flying, United Airlines (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it is now requiring all passengers to complete a health self-assessment during their check-in process, based on recommendations from the Cleveland Clinic.
Chicago-based United's ""Ready-to-Fly"" checklist will ask passengers to confirm they have not experienced COVID-19-related symptoms in the 14 days prior to flying and to agree to wearing a face covering. 
The Transportation Department said U.S. airlines carried about 2.8 million domestic passengers and 132,000 international passengers in April. International passengers fell 99% over April 2019 as the United States imposed flight restrictions on many international visitors.
Passenger traffic has recently risen from April lows and fell only 85% in the week ending June 7, while total flights are down 72%.

Airlines for America, an industry trade group, said demand for future air travel remains down 82% and revenue for future flights is down 92%.

270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 03:09PM ET</span>",One of Greenest Utilities to Seek Backers for Uruguay Power Line,"(Bloomberg) -- Uruguay’s state-run electric utility plans to ask local pension funds and other investors to back development of a $250 million transmission line to make its grid more reliable and expand its ability to sell excess power to neighboring countries.
The 240-kilometer (150-mile) line will be financed in part through a stock or bond offering early next year, UTE Chairman Silvia Emaldi said in an interview.
“It’s a strategic project. It will make the entire national system more robust” and aid “energy export operations basically to Brazil and also Argentina,” Emaldi said in an interview at UTE’s headquarters in Montevideo.
The government’s budget office and UTE will decide this month how much to seek from investors and whether the project will be structured as a trust or a company, Chief Financial Officer Marcos Bazzi said in the interview. The project’s capital structure will probably be 80% debt and 20% equity, with UTE owning a minority stake, he said.
​President Luis Lacalle Pou tapped Emaldi, a veteran UTE executive, to become the utility’s first woman chair shortly after taking office in March. It’s one of the greenest utilities in the world, with hydro, wind, solar and biomass providing 98% of its power last year.
Billions of dollars poured into wind and solar farms over the last decade, enabling Uruguay to export a record 3,011 gigawatts hours of electricity to Brazil and Argentina last year. That’s more than a fifth of its total generation.
Uruguay has enough installed generating capacity to meet domestic demand and export power through February 2025, Emaldi said. She expects UTE to export power for $35 million this year.
The government and UTE are negotiating with Argentina to make it easier to sell power at higher prices to South America’s second-largest economy and guarantee natural-gas imports. UTE is using more expensive gas oil to fuel its Punta del Tigre power plant opened last November because Argentina hasn’t authorized gas exports this year, she said.
“If we had gas and we fired up that plant, which is very competitive with prices similar to wind power, we could be offering energy to Brazil,” Emaldi said.
While exports are paid in hard currency, most of UTE’s revenues are in pesos while imported fuel and equipment are priced in dollars. UTE plans to negotiate currency hedges with financial institutions and the central bank before the end of the year covering as much as 70% of the roughly $800 million in U.S. dollars it will need in 2021, Bazzi said.

(Reuters) - Twenty-six drug manufacturers were sued on Wednesday by the attorneys general of most U.S. states and several territories, which accused them of conspiring to reduce competition and drive up generic drug prices.
The lawsuit accused Novartis' Sandoz unit, Teva Pharmaceuticals'  Actavis  (NYSE:AGN) unit, Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL),  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and other drugmakers of conspiring to rig the market between 2009 and 2016 for more than 80 drugs.
Attorneys general from 46 states, the District of Columbia and four U.S. territories said the defendants prioritized profit over the public interest, depriving millions of consumers of lower prices for needed medication.
Ten executives, including many sales and marketing directors, are also defendants in the 543-page complaint filed in a federal court in Connecticut.
Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said the instances of misconduct related to its $195 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in March ""do not support the vast, systemic conspiracy the states allege.""
The settlement resolved allegations Novartis fixed generic drug prices between 2013 and 2015.
Pfizer spokeswoman Sally Beatty said the drugmaker did not believe it engaged in unlawful conduct. Mylan spokeswoman Lauren Kashtan said her company had found no evidence of price fixing. Teva did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit follows similar cases over generic drug prices brought in 2016 and 2019, and which remain pending.
Brand names of some of the drugs at issue include glaucoma drug Xalatan, acne drug Differin, anti-seizure medicine Dilantin, anti-fungal medicine Lotrimin AF Cream, and Ritalin for attention deficit disorder.

""Through phone calls, text messages, emails, corporate conventions, and cozy dinner parties, generic pharmaceutical executives were in constant communication, colluding to fix prices and restrain competition,"" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said. ""They took steps to evade accountability.""

""The stock market is presaging an upturn in the economy,"" he said in an interview on CNBC, citing the recent market rally and a variety of indicators he said were green shoots of the economy.
The government jobs report released on Friday unexpectedly showed that the U.S. unemployment rate dropped in May while businesses added jobs. Kudlow told CNBC he expected upcoming reports for June and July to also be strong.
Despite the positive signs, the White House and lawmakers continue to discuss another funding round to boost the economic recovery. Kudlow told reporters at the White House ""there's a lot of options.""
""No one is happy with the $600 plus-up,"" Kudlow said, referring to the $600 added to unemployment benefits, which is set to expire next month. Some conservatives have said the amount is too high.
Kudlow added that ""we're looking very carefully"" at a type of return-to-work bonus or credit for workers. 
The U.S. economy ended its longest expansion in history in February and entered recession as a result of the pandemic, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group that determines U.S. business cycles.

Stay-home orders in almost every state led tens of millions of people to file for unemployment benefits while the stock market tumbled and small businesses folded up shop. The U.S. Congress passed multi-trillion dollar packages to help individuals and corporations as well as fight the spread of the disease.

Using the fashion retailer's app, shoppers will be able to browse a specific store's stock to buy items for collection the same day, reserve a changing room, find garments in store via a map and self check-out using QR codes.
The idea is that sophisticated control of stock and high-tech tools for shoppers to locate items both in store and online will lead to more sales at full-price.
The technology will be rolled out across Inditex's stores over the next three years, a company spokesman told Reuters.
One billion euros of the investment is earmarked for a proprietary technology platform, the company said.
Inditex uses radio frequency technology, attached as a chip to the alarm on clothing, to keep track of stock. This tracking technology, already in use for some time at its brands like Zara and Massimo Dutti, will be used across all the group's brands by the end of 2020.
Although Inditex reported plunging first-quarter sales on Wednesday as physical stores were forced to shut, resulting in its first ever loss, it managed to keep inventory 10% lower - a testament to its short lead times and ability to react quickly to changes in demand.
In contrast, H&M said its stocks of unsold goods had grown to just above 41 billion Swedish crowns ($4.2 billion) at the end of April, from 37.2 billion at the end of February and 40 billion a year earlier.
Inditex made a 287 million euro write-off on unsold spring/summer stock due to the coronavirus lockdowns at the time of its full-year results in March.

Fibank's capital increase is the last box Bulgaria has to tick before it can get the nod to enter the European Union's banking union and the ""waiting room"" to join the euro. Sofia hopes to join both in July.
Economy minister Emil Karanikolov said on Wednesday the state had participated in the capital increase at an acceptable level, but declined to say how many shares it would buy, making clear it would not subscribe the whole issue. He said an official statement would be published on Friday. 
Fibank is selling 40 million new shares to raise 200 million levs ($116.1 million) to help it to cover the capital shortfall. 
Karanikolov said the coronavirus crisis had hit investors' appetite and the state had to step in to ensure that Bulgaria would meet all requirements to enter the two-year obligatory precursor to the euro, the ERM-2 mechanism.
""The state had to participate. Our main aim was for private investment to get in. Simply, the state aiming to deliver on its national strategy, had to make this buffer,"" Karanikolov told private BTV television.
""If we had said from day one that the state will participate, we would not have achieved this effect,"" Karanikolov said. ""And the effect is for Bulgaria to fulfil everything necessary for an entry in the waiting room. This is very important.""
All 110 million rights to subscribe the new shares were sold on the Bulgarian Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The subscription for the new shares, offered at a market premium of 5 levs per share, will run until June 25 and trading is expected to start in early August.
Shares in Fibank rose 0.8% to 2.6 levs per share on Wednesday.
Stakes in Fibank owned by Bulgarian businessmen Tseko Minev and Ivailo Mutafchiev, who each own 42.5%, will be diluted after the issue, but they will remain majority shareholders.
The remaining 15% is floated on the Sofia bourse.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson moved up the start of human clinical trials for its experimental vaccine against the highly contagious coronavirus by two months to the second half of July, as the drugmaker rushes to develop a prevention for COVID-19, the company said on Wednesday.
The acceleration should allow J&J to take part in the massive clinical trials program planned by the U.S. government, which aims to have an effective vaccine by year end.
J&J shares rose nearly 2% to $148.69.
Last March, J&J signed deals with the U.S. government to create enough manufacturing capacity to produce more than 1 billion doses of its vaccine through 2021, even before it has evidence that it works.
There are currently no U.S. approved treatments or vaccines for the virus. A vaccine is seen as essential to ending the pandemic that has infected more than 7.2 million people and killed over 412,000 globally, while battering economies worldwide. 
J&J initially expected safety trials to start in September. Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company has been working closely with its U.S. government partners to accelerate that timeline.
""Based on the strength of the preclinical data we have seen so far and interactions with the regulatory authorities, we have been able to further accelerate the clinical development,"" Stoffels said in a statement on Wednesday.
J&J's study will test the vaccine for safety and early signs of efficacy in 1,045 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, and in those aged 65 and older. The trial will take place in the United States and Belgium.
The company is also in talks with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID) to start larger, late-stage trials ahead of schedule, depending on results of the early studies and regulatory approval.
The United States is planning to test a handful of coronavirus vaccine candidates in trials that will enroll up to 30,000 subjects with the aim of getting an answer on efficacy as quickly as possible. National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told Reuters that companies will need to complete their safety trials by the end of summer to be included in those studies. 
Stoffels said last week that J&J hopes to have results of its vaccine efficacy trials in the first quarter of 2021. He added that the company is ""working hard to bring it back to the end of the year.""
A lot will depend on how much virus is circulating at that time, he said. 
""If you have an incidence of 1% a year versus 4% a year, it's totally different. And that's where these trials are so unpredictable,"" he said referring to the percentage of new cases occurring in the population at the time.
The company plans to test the vaccine in high-transmission regions within the United States. If the incidence is low, ""we will complement that with international sites to make sure that we reach enough endpoints quickly to prove the vaccine works,"" Stoffels said.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, which is working in close partnership with NIAID, has started testing its vaccine candidate in a 600-subject mid-stage trial. The company expects to begin late-stage trials in July.
Moderna's vaccine uses messenger RNA technology, an approach that has yet to produce any approved vaccines. J&J is utilizing the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine, which won European regulatory approval late last month. 
There are about 10 coronavirus vaccines in human testing. Experts have said a safe and effective vaccine could take at least 12 to 18 months from the start of development, which would shave several years off the typical vaccine development timeline.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Cboe Futures Exchange submitted a regulatory filing on Tuesday to launch mini futures on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) as it looks to expand its array of products that allow investors to guard against equity market gyrations.
The mini futures will be a 10th of the size of VIX futures but will have the same settlement dates, the exchange, which is owned by Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE), said in its filing https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2020/20-018-VXM-Product-Filing.pdf with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A launch date has not yet been set, but the exchange expects the mini futures to debut later this year.
VIX futures are commonly used to hedge against market declines, such as March's plunge in U.S. stocks that signaled the end of a nearly 11-year-old bull market.
Cboe previously offered mini VIX futures from March 2009 to February 2014. Since then, demand for VIX products has increased among retail investors, the exchange said. A smaller contract size would allow individual investors to buy such hedges at lower costs.
Standard VIX futures are not accessible to smaller accounts, said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Thompson Capital Management. At current prices for front-month contracts (VXc1), for instance, a $250,000 account would have more than 10% of its funds allocated to a single contract.
""The main sticking point with the original contracts is that the size is pretty big, so you need larger accounts, and it's hard to fine-tune exposure like we want to,"" Thompson said.
Even before the March sell-off, investors had expressed interest in mini futures, but demand for such a product has accelerated amid recent market turmoil, said Matt McFarland, vice president and head of futures at Cboe Futures Exchange.
""It's market conditions like we just experienced where the utility of the VIX really demonstrates itself,"" he said.

285,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>",Banks Say They’re Gaining Against Fintechs During Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) -- Fintech startups chipped away at U.S. banks’ customer base for years, in everything from wealth management to consumer lending and beyond. Now banks says they’re taking some market share back.
Traditional lenders are seeing the coronavirus pandemic as weakening the upstarts that have been challenging them since the last financial crisis, with consumers seeking refuge with larger companies to cope with the outbreak’s economic toll. Clients are gravitating toward the “biggest, stable institutions,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said.
“There were some major outages with some of the new online robo players,” Gorman said Tuesday at Morgan Stanley’s Virtual U.S. Financials Conference. “That doesn’t work. You can’t not access your account for several days.”
Earlier this year, online brokerage Robinhood Markets’ trading platform failed repeatedly as global stocks swung on news about the coronavirus. The glitches spurred some clients to leave the platform for competitors.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). customers have opened almost 300,000 new investment accounts on the company’s Merrill Edge platform, consumer and small business head Dean Athanasia said during the conference.
There’s a “flight to quality,” he said. “So we are attracting an awful lot of new clients.”
The client influx goes beyond investing and wealth management. Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) Group Inc. is gaining market share in mortgages as “a lot of the nonbanks are having some real challenges at the moment,” consumer banking head Brendan Coughlin said Tuesday.
For fintechs, the pandemic marks the first major economic slump they’ve dealt with, testing their businesses as customers retreat to the safety of traditional banks. Money has been pouring into the largest banks since the coronavirus outbreak began hurting the economy. Deposits at the 25 largest domestically chartered commercial banks rose by about $1.3 trillion from the end of February through May 27, according to Federal Reserve data.

286,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",A casino or stock market? Retail buying frenzy goes wild,"By Thyagaraju Adinarayan and John McCrank
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A raft of small cap stocks has soared by hundreds of millions of dollars in value in recent weeks as frenzied retail traders piled in to a blistering stocks rally.
Increased savings, stimulus checks from the government, and ultra-low interest rates due to the coronavirus pandemic have led to a flood of money into the markets from punters, leading to chaotic trades via mobile phone apps.
A little-known Chinese online real estate company's American depositary shares (ADSs) jumped as much as 1,250% on Tuesday before closing 400% higher. The reason cited widely on social media was a part of its name, FANGDD Network (O:DUO).
""In my 20 years of experience I've never seen retail traders push stocks around like they're doing right now,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader with Bright Trading LLC. ""When the retail rush comes into something, it can really move.""
Chasing the so-called FANG stocks (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)), which powered the Nasdaq 100 (NDX) above 10,000 points for the first time ever, investors also bought FANGDD at pricey levels, traders say. 
At least three London-based traders said the surge was down to ""Robinhood"" traders - Robinhood is a popular stock trading app that greets visitors to its website with the motto ""It's Time to Do Money.""
Robinhood's website said at noon on Wednesday 9,417 of its users owned FANGDD, up from 4,002 shortly after the market opened. By midday the stock was down around 50%. A Robinhood spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.
""This is what you get when the markets are powering ahead and investors will latch onto anything that has a name that linking to tech stocks,"" said Jawaid Afsar, a trader at Securequity Ltd.
Online brokerages, including  Charles Schwab  Corp (N:SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (O:AMTD), saw a surge in new accounts going back to October, when most adopted Robinhood's commission-free trading model. New accounts and average daily trading levels spiked in March when markets were whipsawed by volatility caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
In further evidence that retail investors are giving a helping hand to the global equities rally, Refinitiv's chief executive, David Craig, recently wrote on Twitter that the usage stats on their Eikon terminal showed the number of private investors retrieving equities data was up 124% in the final week of May vs. the 2019 average.
Pointing to U.S. savings surging to $6.2 trillion in April from $1.4 trillion in February, Goldman Sachs (N:GS) said many indicators have started to show an increase in retail investor activity.
FANGDD issued a statement on Wednesday warning investors the trading price of its ADSs ""could be subject to significant volatility for various reasons that are out of the company’s control.""
FANGDD, which reported $517 million in revenue last year, now has a market capitalisation of around $3.76 billion.
The moves in FANGDD are reminiscent of recent years in which punters chased any company with ""cannabis"" or ""blockchain"" in its name. The chaotic trading in FANGDD wasn't a one-off.
Last week, a similar euphoria was seen in bankrupt or soon-to-be-bankrupt stocks with Hertz (N:HTZ), Chesapeake (N:CHK), Whiting (N:WLL) and JC Penney (OTC:JCPNQ) rising 300% to 500% before pulling back a bit, leaving seasoned traders scratching their heads.
Data from Robintrack, a site that tracks activity on the Robinhood app, showed Hertz was topping the leaderboard for highest changes in popularity among retail traders.
In another mysterious move, Rainbow Rangers producer Genius Brands (O:GNUS) shares soared 300% between June 1 and 3 before giving up half of those gains to settle at around $4.

""It is frightening to see the complete absence of any common sense,"" said a Germany-based trader who has been trading U.S. equities for close to two decades. ""Las Vegas and Macau are closed, and it shows here.""

290,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>","Tesla shares surge past $1,000 as Musk revs up the Semi","By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) stock jumped above $1,000 a share on Wednesday after Chief Executive Elon Musk told his staff it was time to bring the Tesla Semi commercial truck to ""volume production."" 
Musk, in an email seen by Reuters on Wednesday, did not specify a time frame for ramping up production of the Semi. Musk on Wednesday tweeted ""Yes"" to a question on Twitter about whether the report of the leaked Semi truck production email was accurate. 
Tesla's shares rose about 6% to hit $1,000 on Wednesday after Reuters reported Musk's email, making the Silicon Valley company the second-most valuable automaker in the world, behind Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203). Tesla's share surge could position Musk for another payout from a stock compensation plan tied to the company's market capitalization.
The stock also got a boost from a bullish call by Wedbush, which lifted its target price for the automaker to $1,000 and said Tesla could have ""more room to run."" 
Investors also are anticipating Musk will unveil new ""million-mile"" battery technology that could deliver longer life, lower costs and better range for future Tesla vehicles.
""Production of the battery and powertrain will take place at Giga Nevada,"" Musk wrote. Most of the other work will probably take place in other states, he wrote, without stating where.
Musk has said Tesla is scouting other U.S. states for a site to build a new factory, hinting that Texas could be a candidate. Oklahoma and other states are campaigning for the investment.
When Musk unveiled the prototype of the futuristic, battery-powered Semi in 2017, he said the Class 8 truck would go into production by 2019. More recently, he said the Semi would go into volume production by 2021.
Musk's Tuesday message coincides with a surge in the share price of rival clean truck maker  Nikola Corp  (O:NKLA). 
Nikola, an electric and fuel cell truck startup, earlier this month began trading on the NASDAQ after it merged with special purpose acquisition company VectoIQ. 
Shares in Nikola have more than doubled in price over the past week as the company's CEO has used Twitter and interviews to promote plans to launch an electric pickup truck to Tesla's forthcoming Cybertruck.
Nikola and CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI)'s IVECO commercial truck operation last year formed a joint venture to build a battery electric and fuel cell truck line called the Nikola Tre. IVECO has said orders are strong for the electric version of the truck, due out next year.

Nikola on Wednesday said it had hired a former Tesla executive, Mark Duchesne, to lead its manufacturing and a former  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) executive, Pablo Koziner, to head its hydrogen fueling and battery recharging business.

Michel Barnier said the U.K. would crash out of the European single market on Jan. 1 unless the British government scales back opposition to key EU demands. These include the bloc’s insistence that any deal include provisions on fishing rights, fair competition, and dispute settlement.
“There are still major hurdles ahead of us,” Barnier told an EU advisory panel on Wednesday in Brussels. “We can find the necessary compromises on the condition that the U.K. changes its approach and accepts a proper balance of rights, benefits, obligations and legally binding constraints.”
Under the terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU earlier this year, a transition period preserving the economic status quo runs until the end of 2020 and can be prolonged by as long as two years while both sides negotiate a free-trade deal.
A decision to prolong the transition phase -- something U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ruled out -- would have to be taken before the end of this month. Barnier said the EU would like to prolong the transition.
Failure to seal an accord by Dec. 31 without a longer transition would mean the return of tariffs and quotas for EU-U.K. commerce. Those trade barriers would be in addition to extra red tape for businesses that’ll emerge in any case because the U.K. will be leaving the European single market.
Michael Clauss, Germany’s ambassador to the EU, signaled last week the push for a free-trade deal with the U.K. would rise to the top of the bloc’s agenda after the summer break.
“This Brexit issue is going to absorb most of the political attention we expect in September and October,” Clauss told a June 4 online event organized by the European Policy Centre.

(Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc (N:SPG), the biggest U.S. mall operator, said on Wednesday it was ending its $3.6 billion deal to buy  Taubman Centers Inc  (N:TCO), citing the beating the retail sector has taken during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Simon Property said that the coronavirus outbreak ""disproportionately hurt"" Taubman's malls because they are located in densely populated metropolitan areas, depend on tourism and feature high-end retailers whose sales have shrunk. 
Simon Property, which runs shopping destinations such as the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, also said that Taubman did not cut costs to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. 
There are no discussions about renegotiating the transaction at a lower valuation, a person familiar with the matter said. 
A spokeswoman for Taubman, whose properties include the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Taubman shares dropped 25% to $34 and Simon shares dropped 9% to $78.99 on the news, which follows a string of other broken deals.
Last month, private equity firm Sycamore Partners ended its $525 million deal to acquire lingerie brand Victoria's Secret from L Brands Inc (N:LB), while Japanese telecommunications conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) dropped its agreement to fund a $3 billion tender offer for co-working company WeWork.

The combination of the two mall owners was announced in February. The growth of online shopping had already slashed foot traffic at brick-and-mortar retail stores, and the pandemic has accelerated that trend.

298,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>","Market Shouldn’t Fret Biden Presidency, Scowcroft Group Says","(Bloomberg) -- Some on Wall Street may be starting to get nervous about the idea of a Joe Biden presidency, but such fears may be misplaced, according to a veteran Washington advisory group.
“There is no question that in the short-term investors prefer GOP victories,” the Scowcroft Group’s Tom Gallagher and Kevin Nealer, who each have followed policymaking in the U.S. capital for decades, wrote in a recent note. Even so, “history says investors shouldn’t be nervous” about a Biden victory, they wrote.
While it’s true that policies have an important impact on financial markets, what ultimately gets implemented won’t be clear on election day, they said. And investors need also to weigh the potential risks of a Trump win, which could include escalating trade tensions with Germany and the continuation of the current president’s “lack of capacity for crisis management,” they wrote.
The resurgence in U.S. stocks from their Covid-19 crisis low in March, along with Biden’s recent strong polling numbers, have revived investor interest in the November election.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). earlier this month laid out one scenario where changes to tax policy under Democratic leadership could cut earnings per share on the S&P 500 by 12% in 2021.
As the Goldman strategists also noted, a key brake on any full-blown progressive agenda will be the likely make-up of Congress, Gallagher and Nealer wrote. Even if the Democrats sweep the White House and both of the federal legislature’s bodies, a thin margin in the Senate could mean that little of a progressive agenda gets enacted, the Scowcroft analysts wrote.
As for regulation that doesn’t need congressional action, that may not prove so influential, according to Gallagher and Nealer.
“Market research showed no correlation between sectors that benefited from de-regulation by Trump and those sectors’ relative performance,” they wrote.
And on trade, Biden would likely act in a “less disruptive, more multilateral way” than the Trump administration has, they wrote. Investors ought as well to consider the risks of a withdrawal from the the World Trade Organization in a second Trump presidency, they wrote.
“Republicans are thought to be good for the supply side of the economy,” Gallagher and Nealer wrote. “In Trump’s case the effects of lower marginal tax rates and deregulation have to be netted against reduced immigration and higher trade barriers.”

The company said it would permanently close about 400 stores in the Americas over the next 18 months and cut its planned new store openings by half to about 300 this fiscal year, signifying the lasting impact of the pandemic.
The world's largest coffee chain's shares fell nearly 4%, as it also forecast a bigger-than-expected current-quarter loss and an over $3 billion fall in revenue.
With the COVID-19 pandemic effectively putting a stop to dining out in most of the United States for weeks, Starbucks was forced to convert its cafes to pick-up or drive-through joints only. 
The company said it would now speed up the opening of pick-up only stores, especially in urban areas, as health experts advise people to stick with social-distancing norms. 
Starbucks projected an adjusted loss of about 55 cents to 70 cents per share for its third quarter ending in June, and said it expects U.S. same-store sales to drop by up to 45%. Analysts were expecting a third-quarter loss of 16 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
However, declines are expected to slow towards the end of the year. 
The company expects same-store sales in China to drop by 20% to 25%, slightly more optimistic than an earlier forecast of 25% to 35% fall. (https:// 
Starbucks said it expects current quarter operating income decline between $2 billion to $2.2 billion. It reported an operating income of $1.07 billion in the third quarter of last year.

(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) commodities unit generated more than $1 billion in revenue this year through May as traders positioned their bets for the collapse in oil prices, a source familiar with the group's finances said on Wednesday.
The gains were largely driven by oil trading, the source said, though other commodities, including natural gas, power and precious metals contributed, the source said. 
Oil prices plunged to their lowest in years in a dramatic selloff at the start of March. U.S. crude futures at one point fell deep into negative territory as panicked traders bailed out of positions after realizing many would be forced to take physical delivery of oil without a place to put the barrels.
Most of Goldman's boost came from oil trading overseen by Singapore-based partner Qin Xiao and Anthony Dewell in London, amid the collapse in oil prices, according to Bloomberg News, which first reported the $1 billion figure, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Numerous funds and brokerages suffered heavy losses in the selloff, sparked by a slump in car and air travel amid lockdowns to curb the spread of the new coronavirus as well as an argument between Saudi Arabia and Russia over production volumes.

""We are market makers and a client franchise business, and now as always we do all we can to help our clients manage their risk,"" Goldman spokesman Patrick Lenihan told Reuters.

Mannheim prosecutors had been seeking to fine UBS's German unit 82 million euros ($93.2 million) for helping clients evade taxes.
The prosecutors alleged executives at subsidiary UBS Deutschland AG helped several clients to break tax laws between 2001 and 2012, aided by executives at the Swiss parent.
UBS, which paid about 300 million euros in 2014 to resolve a similar German case in Bochum, had said it would fight the Mannheim demand.
Mannheim prosecutors said they had now dropped their original fine request due to new upper court decisions adjusting the financial requirements, and a case in Mannheim's district court had been concluded.
""Although the hearing of evidence to date had confirmed in principle the inadmissible use of the UBS transfer system, it had also shown that it had not originally been developed for the purpose of tax evasion and had not been used comprehensively in such a context,"" prosecutors said in their statement.
UBS was requested to pay judicial authorities around 4 million euros for the absorption of profits.
UBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) expects to have its U.S. vehicle assembly plants return by early July to building at the rates they did before the coronavirus pandemic shut down the U.S. auto industry for two months, a top executive said on Wednesday.
""By July 6, we will expect to have all of our U.S. plants operating at pre-COVID patterns,"" Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said on a webcast of a presentation at a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) auto conference. 
Ford and other Detroit automakers resumed production in the United States on May 18.
Farley said in the first three weeks following the restart, Ford built about 96% of its planned volume. 
""We're really pleased with our start,"" he said, adding that beginning the week of July 8 Ford will begin adding back a third shift of work at many of its plants.
Ford's retail sales in May rose 44% from April, and its F-Series large pickup truck saw retail sales rise 5.3% from last year and gain 2.4 percentage points of market share, Farley said. 
The upcoming launches of the new version of the No. 2 U.S. automaker's highly profitable F-150 as well as the new Bronco SUV and Mustang Mach-E electric SUV are in ""really good shape,"" he said.
However, Farley acknowledged there will be ""some impact"" on the timing of those launches because Ford couldn't get into the plants during the shutdown.
Ford will introduce electric versions of the F-150 and its Transit van in the next 24 months, he said.
Also on Wednesday, Ford finalized details of its alliance with Germany's Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p). Farley said Ford also remains open to other investors in its Argo AI self-driving unit in addition to VW.

The factories will be producing at levels they were prior to the Covid-19 outbreak by July 6, Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said Wednesday at the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Global Auto Industry Conference. The manufacturing restart has been smooth, with Ford building about 96% of the volume it was planning for the first three weeks since its facilities came back online.
Ford has forecast a $5 billion loss for this quarter tied to a two-month shutdown of its North American factories and significant volume declines in every region. The automaker expects introductions of models such as the redesigned F-150 pickup and new electric Mustang Mach-E to be delayed by roughly the span of time its plants were down.
“We do have some impact on launch timing because we just couldn’t get in the facilities during the shutdown, but we see no other delays beyond the manufacturing shutdown period,” Farley said.
After resuming U.S. production on May 18, Ford is starting to add overtime work at its F-150 factories to meet strong demand for pickups. It’s also beginning to resume third production shifts, meaning facilities are running virtually around the clock.
Some workers have pushed back against how quickly Ford has ramped back up, saying the company isn’t doing enough to protect staff who are falling ill with Covid-19. Ford has said it’s unaware of any employee contracting the disease inside its plants, but it has postponed calling back salaried workers to offices by at least two months.
Ford shares fell 4% as of 9:58 a.m. in New York. The stock has dropped 25% this year.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",British companies seek extra time to plug ballooning pension gaps: sources,"By Carolyn Cohn and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - An increasing number of British companies, trying to conserve cash through the coronavirus crisis, are seeking more time to plug pension scheme deficits, forcing pension trustees to make some tough choices, industry sources say.
Many of these ""defined benefit"" pension schemes are closed to new members, but more than 7 million people are still paying into them, including thousands of workers from the country's biggest companies.
The pension deficit issue also has an impact on investors, as the country's pension watchdog has said companies should resume payments into pensions schemes ahead of dividends to shareholders. And big pension scheme deficits can also become major hurdles to M&A activity.
Pension deficits have ballooned during the pandemic because of its impact on stock markets and bond yields. The country's 5,000-plus defined benefit, or ""final salary"" schemes, had a collective funding gap of 176 billion pounds ($222.66 billion) at end-May, its widest since August 2017 and compared with only 11 billion pounds at end-2019.
Two-thirds of the 5,422 defined benefit pension schemes in the PPF 7800 index are in deficit. The index represents pension schemes outside the public sector. 
Mindful of the pressures facing company boards, with whole swathes of the economy out of action, the pensions regulator in March said pension fund trustees should be open to deferrals of top-up payments by companies to fix deficits, usually for three months. The regulator said it would review this guidance by end-June. https://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/en/covid-19-coronavirus-what-you-need-to-consider/db-scheme-funding-and-investment-covid-19-guidance-for-trustees
Industry sources told Reuters they expect the watchdog to support further payment holiday requests, in line with government extensions to furlough schemes for companies under pressure from the months-long quarantine.
A spokesman for the Pensions Regulator said the watchdog might issue more guidance before the end of June, but did not give more detail.
As many as 15% of companies have sought a deferral already, according to the regulator.
Mike Smedley, partner at consultants Isio, said this is likely to represent a record drop in pension fund contributions. 
The companies include threadmaker  Coats Group  (L:COA) and media companies Reach (L:RCH) and  ITV  (L:ITV), with more expected to follow when they publish their next set of earnings.
Bina Mistry, senior director at consultants Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), said given loss of earnings due to the economic crisis, the number was likely to grow: ""The longer this goes on, the harder it becomes.""
Industries from travel to hospitality and retail have asked for and received a three-month deferral to buy time to assess the economic damage to their businesses. But the real dilemma for pension fund trustees will be if they come back to ask for a potentially much longer break.
Pension fund trustees' primary focus is on securing pension payouts over decades so they do not want companies to go bust, which would mean reduced payouts for members from industry lifeboat the Pension Protection Fund.
At the same time, though, they do not want the funding gap to grow so big that companies struggle to fill it. 
""The initial (deferral) requests (were) very much about helping the company not to run out of cash,"" said Huw Evans, director at independent trustee group BESTrustees. He also said that longer deferrals would ""involve trustees doing far more due diligence as to what they think the future prospects of the company are.""
An important part of that process will involve checking that companies do not let go of their pensions obligations too lightly, and that they are also making other cuts, such as to dividends and management pay.

Some companies may offer security to the pension in case payments never resume. Martin Hunter, a partner at XPS Pensions Group, said such security had to be something which gained in value over time, usually in the form of property.

The Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) said that Danske had misinformed the financial market by facilitating so-called ""wash trades"", in which the same person sells and buys securities, between August 12, 2016 and February 22, 2019. Such trades could misleadingly prop up or devalue the price of securities, it added. 
""The FSA therefore finds that Danske Bank has violated the prohibition on market manipulation and has reported Danske Bank for this.""
Danske's chief compliance officer, Philippe Vollot said the bank took the matter very seriously.
""We did not have adequate market monitoring in place and we have therefore, since 2019, made significant investments to strengthen the systems and controls in close dialogue with the FSA,"" he said, adding that the Bank had not seen any indication of ""intentional wrongdoing or any harm to customers or market participants"".
The FSA said it had also reported Danske Bank to the police for failing to properly monitor and report transactions, which could constitute market abuse.
Both violations can be punished by fines.
The FSA said it did not believe Danske Bank had intentionally facilitated trades with itself, but the transactions reflected flaws in the bank's market surveillance. 
""However, trading with oneself is illegal if the behaviour exhibited is market manipulative, regardless of whether the investor has traded with himself intentionally or not,"" it said.

 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). estimate that the ECB’s 600-billion-euro ($682 billion) increase to the program will probably be about 150 billion euros below the bloc’s increase in debt supply, according to an emailed note to clients. If the imbalance is exacerbated, the risk is that borrowing costs for some of the euro area’s most-indebted nations, particularly Italy, may rise, just as countries need to be able to spend money uninhibited.
That’s because the ECB’s backstop has been a key driver for demand of European debt. So while European sovereigns have stepped up bond sales, orderbooks have been massive. Ireland, Spain and Greece raised more than 20 billion euros of bonds on Tuesday, and together with the U.K.’s offering, they received orders of almost $300 billion.
Italy announced on Monday the sale of a new bond aimed at domestic investors as it seeks to raise the cash required, and Germany and Finland are in the market today.
Europe’s borrowing needs this year are enormous as governments cushion the region’s economy for what could be the steepest recession since World War II. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that euro area nations will have to sell at least 1.2 trillion euros of bonds this year, but that figure may rise.
On top of that, the supply of short-dated debt instruments is also set to top 1 trillion euros, according to Citigroup. Meanwhile, the ECB’s pandemic bond buying program is 1.35 trillion euros.
“Such supply volumes do leave marks in the market,” wrote  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV strategists led by Padhraic Garvey. “The debt tsunami continues.”

319,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>","Exclusive: RWE, Thyssenkrupp plan hydrogen production venture","By Tom Käckenhoff, Christoph Steitz and Vera Eckert
DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's RWE plans to produce hydrogen from renewable energy to supply steelmaker Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG), the two companies told Reuters.
The alliance between two of Germany's heaviest polluters comes as Europe's largest economy maps out a future without nuclear or coal power.
RWE is currently heavily reliant on coal but is able to enter the hydrogen business due to changes to Germany's laws as the government looks to boost hydrogen production.
The planned cooperation between the two sector leaders is aimed at using green hydrogen, where the electricity used in the electrolysis that separates hydrogen from water comes from renewable sources.
RWE plans to build a 100 megawatt hydrogen plant in the state of Lower Saxony to supply Thyssenkrupp's steel operations in Duisburg by the middle of the decade, the companies said, responding to a Reuters request for comment.
Steelmaking accounts for 7-9% of global emissions and has long been considered an ideal use case for hydrogen.
The plant will be able to deliver 1.7 tonnes of hydrogen gas per hour, or about 70% of that required by a blast furnace which Thyssenkrupp plans to install, they said.
This could produce 50,000 tonnes of climate-neutral steel per year, enough needed to make as many cars, they said.
Thyssenkrupp produces 11 million tonnes of steel a year but the partnership would mark a start and reflects an industry-wide shift toward greener energy as rivals, including heavyweight ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT), start to explore the technology.
""Climate neutrality in the steel sector is possible and we're accelerating the switch with regard to our production,"" said Bernhard Osburg, CEO of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe.
Germany has committed 9 billion euros ($10.2 billion) to expand hydrogen capacity at home and abroad as part of a national strategy to make the country a key supplier of the technology worldwide.
The companies said the partnership was dependent on the development of a hydrogen transport network.

Roger Miesen, CEO of RWE's Generation division, said the government's strategy needed to be implemented fast to ensure an effective hydrogen expansion. ""Investment decisions require planning certainty.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. banks have been stocking up on masks and other supplies and setting up acrylic barriers to prevent spreading the novel coronavirus as they ready their branches for the country's gradual reopening, executives and suppliers told Reuters.
Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) has installed over 20,0000 acrylic barriers across branches to prepare for more foot traffic as shelter-in-place orders ease, spokesman Matt Card said. The bank requires employees to wear masks, and has stockpiled enough so that each employee receives one a day, he said. 
 Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF) is also installing barriers, enhancing deep cleaning protocols, placing social-distance markers for queuing and providing hand sanitizers and masks, said spokeswoman Devon Gunn. It will also provide masks to customers if they arrive without one, she added. 
Banks struggled to equip their branches with sufficient supplies at the outset of the crisis, when other essential workers with more crucial jobs – including medical staff, grocery clerks and delivery people – needed them more.
It has become easier to source these materials, executives and suppliers said.
""Now we have a steady supply moving through all of our branches,"" said JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) spokeswoman Anne Pace. The largest U.S. bank is installing acrylic shields at teller stations and cubicles in branches that lacked glass barriers, she said.
Some banks and their employees got creative when supply-lines were tight.
When masks were scarce in March, a group of volunteer  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) employees sewed their own masks and shipped them to colleagues still reporting to the office, according to a bank spokeswoman.

Adidas partners with many prominent black athletes and celebrities and its sneakers and tracksuits have been part of hip hop culture and style since Run-D.M.C. started wearing them in the 1980s.
The Adidas managing board said in a statement it recognised the contribution of the black community to its success, but admitted the company must do more to fight racism and improve company culture to ensure equity, diversity and opportunity.
""While we have talked about the importance of inclusion, we must do more to create an environment in which all of our employees feel safe, heard and have equal opportunity to advance their careers,"" Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said.
Companies around the world have pledged more than a billion dollars for racial and social justice causes amid worldwide protests over the death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck.
Adidas said it would spend $20 million in the next four years on initiatives including a grassroots basketball programme, a school for footwear design and a scheme supporting sport in the black community.
It will also finance 50 scholarships for black students and will set a target aimed at increasing representation of black and Latino people within its workforce in North America, in addition to setting the 30% target for new hires.

Adidas said it would provide details of more actions at staff meetings in Portland and Boston on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - European stocks reversed early gains on Wednesday, as investors turned cautious ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's first economic projections since the COVID-19 pandemic set off a recession in February.
After gaining as much as 0.9% at the open, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was last down 0.5%.
Travel & leisure sector (SXTP) led the declines with a 2.2% fall, while automakers (SXAP), oil & gas (SXEP) and bank stocks (SX7P) - all outperformers in recent weeks - fell between 1.3% and 2%.
While no major policy announcements are expected when the Fed wraps up its meeting later in the day, investors will scrutinize its remarks on the health of the U.S. economy, particularly after the surprise recovery in May jobs data. 
The central bank's projections are expected to signal a collapse in output this year and near-zero interest rates for the next few years.
""European markets are on the back foot once again despite early gains, with traders fearing that the recent recovery in stocks could see (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell take his foot off the gas,"" Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG wrote in a client note.
The continent's markets have seen a broad recovery in recent weeks, with investors moving into cheap, growth-sensitive stocks such as those of banks and oil companies on hopes that the worst fallout from the health crisis is over.
However, the banking index (SX7P) fell 1.3% despite an early boost from a Reuters report that European Central Bank officials were drawing up a scheme to cope with potentially hundreds of billions of euros of unpaid loans.
Hitting travel stocks, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) shares slid 5.9% as the German government planned to extend its travel warning to countries outside Europe until Aug. 31.
""All these stocks have had a huge run lately, and there's a bit of profit taking,"" said Michael Baker, an analyst at ETX Capital.
Continental (DE:CONG) fell 4.0% after a media report cited the German automotive supplier's CEO as saying it must save hundreds of millions of euros in costs and will probably have to lay off workers due to a slump in demand caused by the pandemic.

 Inditex  shares (MC:ITX) gave up early losses to trade 1.6% higher after the Zara owner said in-store sales and customer activity had returned to pre-coronavirus levels in some Asian countries.

Rescue aid can be granted for a maximum of six months and in Portugal's case, the authorities have committed that TAP will reimburse the 1.2 billion euro ($1.36 billion) loan or submit a restructuring plan in that time.
""This 1.2 billion euros Portuguese rescue aid will help TAP Air Portugal face its liquidity needs and pave the way for its restructuring to ensure its long-term viability,"" Commission executive vice president Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Airlines across the world have been trying to raise cash and cut costs after lockdowns to contain the virus pandemic brought global air travel almost to a halt.
The Commission, which oversees competition policy in the European Union, later said it had also cleared Finland's plans to contribute to a recapitalisation of Finnair by subscribing to new shares in a rights issue to raise 500 million euros.
""The substantial participation of market investors in the transaction is a positive signal that the Commission strongly encourages, as it limits the distortion of competition while contributing to the recovery of undertakings affected by the coronavirus outbreak,"" Vestager said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. activist investor Cerberus is calling on Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) to appoint two of its nominees to the supervisory board, cut costs and adopt a new strategy, as it battles to make a success of a big bet on German banks. 
In a letter to Commerzbank's chairman on Tuesday, Cerberus complained the bank had failed to heed its advice after more than 70 meetings. Shares in Germany's second-biggest bank have fallen about 60% since Cerberus bought a 5% stake in 2017. 
The investor, describing Commerzbank's performance as ""disastrous"", demanded it appoint two ""highly qualified individuals to be identified by us"" to its supervisory board.
Cerberus said shareholders would be highly supportive of ""significant change"" to the supervisory board, management board and strategy, but did not give details on what the new strategy should be. 
""The window of opportunity to address the challenges faced by Commerzbank is rapidly closing,"" Cerberus wrote in the five-page letter, seen by Reuters.
A spokeswoman for Commerzbank declined to comment. Its shares, which have hit record lows this year, were last up 0.5% after shedding some earlier gains.
Such public shareholder campaigns are rare in Europe, and in Germany activist investors are often viewed warily - as shareholders focused on short-term profits rather than what is best for companies in the long term. The German government is the largest shareholder in Commerzbank with a 15% stake.
""In my view, state ownership does not make it any easier for Cerberus to achieve its strategic goals,"" said Klaus Nieding of shareholder lobby group DSW.
COST CUTS
The 150-year-old Commerzbank has had a rough few months as it swung to a loss, halted its 2019 dividend plans, backtracked on the sale of its Polish lender mBank (WA:MBK), faced credit rating downgrades, and lost a long-standing sponsorship deal with a local soccer team to rival  Deutsche Bank .
Commerzbank, bailed out by the state during the last financial crisis, has also warned its target for turning a profit in 2020 now seems ""very ambitious"" amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The bank is currently looking for further cost cuts and in talks about staff reductions.
Commerzbank's proponents argue the bank has integrated its Comdirect online brokerage, a pillar of a strategy revamp announced last year.
Two top investors said in interviews that Commerzbank should cut costs by reducing its extensive branch network and focus more on digitalization.
""Perhaps Cerberus' move will even help management to push through more cost-cutting measures with the unions,"" one of the investors said. Both spoke on condition of anonymity.
Just months after buying into Commerzbank, Cerberus also took a 3% stake in Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn). 
The investor was behind a push to merge the two banks last year, people told Reuters at the time, though the effort failed and both banks embarked on separate restructuring measures.
""The precarious situation of Commerzbank requires swift and decisive action now,"" Cerberus wrote, demanding a reply by June 12. 

The letter is expected to be discussed at a supervisory board meeting on Wednesday, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets nudged down from more than three-month highs on Wednesday, while the dollar stumbled as caution took hold ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. 
After weeks of strong gains, propelled by hopes of a swift economic recovery as coronavirus-induced lockdowns lift, equity markets appear to have run out of steam for now. Support for safe havens from gold to the yen, also pointed to wariness.
European stocks gave up early gains and were broadly negative , holding below recent three-month highs. U.S. stock market futures also headed lower. 
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which has galloped 9% higher in June and is 35% above March lows, rose 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei closed up just 0.15%.
No action is expected from the Fed, but any hint of taking the foot off the pedal could hurt risk sentiment and lift the dollar. More dovishness could have the opposite effect.
Focus is on its economic outlook and whether a steepening of the U.S. yield curve during last week's bond selloff might prompt intervention to keep long-term borrowing costs down.
""At this stage (Fed chief Jerome) Powell will be cautious about being too confident and for markets, there is more of a risk of there being a wobble than a prompt to go higher,"" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors in London.
Data showing the sharpest slump in China's producer prices in four years - pointing to flagging global demand - served as a reminder of the impact the coronavirus pandemic is having on the global economy.
So did the latest outlook from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It said on Wednesday that the global economy will suffer the biggest peace-time downturn in a century before it emerges next year from a coronavirus-inflicted recession.
The MSCI world stock index, up nearly 45% from 4-year lows struck in mid-March, also held just below recent three-month highs.

327,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>",A $22 Trillion Stock Rally Now Hinges on Rapid Economic Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- The rebound in global stocks back to December levels -- before the world had heard of Covid-19 -- has outstripped the monetary stimulus pumped into economies by global policy makers, raising the stakes for the V-shaped rebound that has been priced in.
The global stock market’s capitalization has climbed by roughly $22 trillion from the March low. Tallies of central bank stimulus are fraught with challenge, but  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) last month predicted $13 trillion in cumulative balance-sheet expansion during the current easing cycle from the U.S., euro region, Japan and U.K. through the end of 2021.
The 40% plus rally in the MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) All Country World Index from its March low suggests it’s not just policy measures that have rescued investors, but expectations of a real-economy rebound. UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) analysts say that high-frequency indicators of mobility -- such as foot traffic at retailers and metros -- support the equity surge.
The danger, though, for investors and policy makers alike is that any complication in the economic recovery could see market gains swiftly reverse -- at a time when there’s less room for additional policy support, given the scope of what’s already been deployed. And while markets will likely look through horrific second-quarter data, tolerance for depression-like numbers into the second half may be thin.
“It is prudent to expect the script on the pandemic to have a few more dark turns,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “If stock prices slump significantly again, this would be another headwind to the global economic recovery, and put even more pressure on central banks and governments.”
Familiar Movie
Of course, rallying markets are to be celebrated if the global economic outlook lives up to the optimism. And markets are supposed to price in the future -- not the past -- as evidenced with the U.S. credit-market’s unfreezing even before the Federal Reserve got its corporate-debt purchases going.
“The disconnect is a movie I have seen many times,” said Allen Sinai, a Wall Street veteran who has worked as an economist for more than four decades and heads Decision Economics, Inc. “I have seen it in every recession, every downturn. The stock market, before the end of recession, begins to go up and the next equity bull market begins.”
On Monday, the S&P 500 Index turned positive for the year on the very same day that the National Bureau of Economic Research announced that the U.S. economy had officially entered recession for the first time in over a decade.
But history also features rallies that faltered, complicating the road to recovery. The S&P 500 by early January 2009 had enjoyed a 24% climb from a November 2008 low, but the financial crisis had another sting in the tail to come. The index tumbled 28% by early March 2009, keeping pressure on for stimulus.
With the lockdowns and subsequent re-openings disrupting economic patterns like never before, traders have turned to using high-frequency indicators such as location-tracking data from smartphones published by Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), as well as restaurant reservations from OpenTable Inc and traffic statistics from TomTom NV.
They all offer a gauge of whether life is returning to normal -- on the assumption that economic activity should improve as well.
“How good the information they carry will be known when we know if hard, traditional data is following the pointers we are getting,” said Binay Chandgothia, portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors. “For now, they are the only real information sources and they seem like logical datapoints.”
Betting on V
Optimists point to the shock 2.5 million increase in U.S. payrolls and decline in the unemployment rate to 13.3% as firmer evidence of a rebound.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Inc. economists led by Jan Hatzius argue that if global GDP is now rising, the recession will be the deepest -- but also the shortest -- since World War II. Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Chetan Ahya holds a similar view, arguing that upside surprises in economic data points to a “deep V-shaped recovery.”
Stocks have moved to price that in. With corporate earnings having collapsed thanks to the lockdowns, the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 currently sits at 25.6 times, the highest since the dotcom bubble, and far above the average of just under 17 since the start of 2000.
Investment-grade corporate bonds have also come back, with yields hitting record lows, pulled down by the powerful rally in government debt. While 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have climbed from their March lows, analysts surveyed by Bloomberg see them staying below 2% for years to come, effectively held down by the Fed and continued disinflation.
“The big hope is that this optimism, which reflects the silver lining of this historic shock, proves right,” said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE and a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. “But every element requires politicians to remain highly focused, put political polarization aside and appropriately evolve their policy approaches.”

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis may be pushing  El Al  Israel Airlines (TA:ELAL) back into the hands of the state, less than two decades after the flag carrier was privatised.
El Al's union told Reuters it did not oppose state control and said the main issue was keeping the carrier flying, as airlines across the globe have grounded planes and sought government aid.
El Al and controlling shareholder Knafaim Holdings (TA:KNFM) have been in bailout talks with the Finance Ministry, which offered to back $250 million in bank loans but said El Al must issue $150 million in shares. The state said it would buy the shares, giving it a majority, if no one else did.
El Al, which has reported losses for two years running and racked up debt to renew its fleet, suspended flights when Israel closed its borders and furloughed most of its 6,500 employees. It has said it faces bankruptcy without state help.
The government has indicated it would not let Israeli aviation collapse, calling it a strategic asset, Meidan Bar, chairman of the Israel Air Line Pilots Association, said.
He said El Al provided a vital link to the world, as most other international airlines had halted flights to Israel during periods of conflict in the past.
If the state had a majority, it would give control to an independent trustee to handle daily operations and would seek to sell the shares in the future, a senior finance ministry official told Reuters.
""The state is not interested in nationalising El Al and making it a government company. The aim is to assist the company so it can recover from the crisis,"" the official said.
El Al and Knafaim Holdings declined to comment.
""We know we are headed down a new road, it doesn't matter if it's a government or private company,"" said Avi Edri, head of the transport union at Israel's labour federation. ""We know we will have to let a number of workers go.""

Two decades ago, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was finance minister, he led a push to sell El Al and other state-owned companies. His office declined to comment on El Al's fate.

The Guizhou-based regional airline did not provide details of the number of each model it wanted to buy, but said the two sides needed to hammer out the contractual details later on, a corporate filing to the Shenzhen stock exchange showed. 
The planned purchases of the domestically-developed aircraft are a boost to state planemaker COMAC at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is devastating global travel demand, prompting many airlines to cancel or defer aircraft orders with top manufacturers Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA). 
China Express and COMAC will also deepen cooperation on aircraft design and optimization, maintenance and services, and overseas market expansion, especially in countries that have signed up to China's Belt and Road Initiative and African markets, the carrier said. 
By the end of May, COMAC had delivered 25 ARJ21-700 regional jets, according to state media reports. The country's three biggest state-owned airlines last year announced deals to each purchase 35 ARJ21 jets. 

The C919, China's bid to break the Airbus and Boeing duopoly in the narrow-body passenger jet market, is still in flight-testing phase after years of delay. It is expected to receive Chinese airworthiness certification next year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:8411) has seen coronavirus-related loan requests reach 17 trillion yen ($155 billion) since the outbreak, and is bracing for further demand from companies battling to revive their operations, its chief executive said.
The figure underscores the corporate impact of restrictions on movement and business imposed by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19, which has infected nearly 18,000 people in Japan and killed almost 1,000.
Since the first COVID-19 cases were reported in Japan in January, 225 companies have gone bankrupt as of Monday, showed data from Tokyo Shoko Research.
""As clients face liquidity problems, we will help with financing as appropriate,"" Chief Executive Tatsufumi Sakai said in an interview last week for publication on Wednesday.
""But later, the problem may change from liquidity to solvency. At that stage, companies will need capital buffers to continue business.""
Japan's third-largest lender said it has extended 10 trillion yen in loans and credit lines from requests it deemed virus-related based on discussions with the clients.
To support clients' capital positions, Mizuho has secured over 100 billion yen for so-called mezzanine financing, such as subordinated debt and preferred stocks, Sakai said. 
But banks themselves also expect a difficult year. Mizuho estimates 200 billion yen worth of credit-related costs in the year through March 2021, whereas bigger rivals Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc (T:8306) and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc (T:8316) expect 450 billion yen.
""We can't afford to lend to companies that are likely to turn into zombies,"" said Sakai. ""The crisis won't be easy to overcome. It's crucial for us and our clients to rebuild with an eye toward the post-coronavirus world.""

""Those early indications that we have seen now in the last couple of weeks have been actually quite promising and going in the right direction. We clearly had a lot of stress in the system in the second half of March but things really calmed down in April and they continue to be quite robust in May and June,"" he said in an audiocast for a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) conference.
""So far, so good. Clearly we expect very bad economic data for Europe and the U.S. for Q2 but overall actually if I speak to my colleagues on the corporate banking side in Switzerland, to my colleagues in investment banking, we actually see high engagement with our clients and that makes me actually feel quite optimistic in the circumstances."" 
Increased activity within its private banking business was more than compensating for a reduction in recurring revenues caused by a drop in the level of managed assets, Gottstein said, adding asset levels were now also recovering. 
Switzerland's second-biggest bank was also seeing a ""very high degree"" of appetite from its corporate customers to refinance themselves either through equity or debt, Chief Financial Officer David Mathers said, adding capital markets activity was picking up across the market.
Gottstein reiterated the bank's mid-term return on tangible equity target, repeating comments made in April that for 2020, the bank could not commit to its 10% target due to ongoing uncertainty.

The bank still expects to pay the second half of its 2019 dividend in the fourth quarter, and would consider resuming a share buyback suspended during the coronavirus pandemic after seeing the financial results of the second and third quarters, he said, noting decisions on both were still pending.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Wednesday, helped by gains in the banking sector, but trading ranges have been tight ahead of the conclusion of the latest policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.
At 4:00 AM ET (0800 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 0.8%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.6%. 
These gains are continuing the positive tone of late, largely based on optimism over a global recovery from the coronavirus crisis, as well as coordinated monetary and fiscal stimulus from central banks and governments.
The European Central Bank is now looking at a scheme to cope with potentially hundreds of billions of euros of unpaid loans in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reported.
The project is aimed at shielding commercial banks from staggering amounts of debt that is considered unlikely to be repaid, particularly if rising unemployment chokes off the income needed to do so.
The banking sector responded positively to this, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) up 2.7%,  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) up 2.6% and Santander (MC:SAN) gaining 2.2%.
Earlier Wednesday, the French government said it is considering whether to end all emergency health measures imposed to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic on July 10.
This comes as the country’s industrial production slumped by 20% in April, following a drop of 16% the previous month.
Investors will also be keeping a keen eye on the Federal Reserve as the U.S. central bank concludes its policy meeting later in the day.
While no major policy announcements are expected, investors will scrutinize its remarks on the health of the economy, the world’s largest, particularly after the recent upturn in jobs numbers.
In corporate news,  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the Spanish fashion giant, said Wednesday that it swung to a first-quarter loss and recorded a big sales decline, citing the impact of the coronavirus.
Oil prices sold off Wednesday, weighed by the American Petroleum Institute’s surprise estimate of an 8.4-million-barrel build for the week ended June 5 late Tuesday, prompting renewed fears of a supply glut.
Investors will now look closely at the Energy Information Administration’s prediction, due later in the day.

An Emirates spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the airline's statement on Tuesday that said some employees had been laid off. No further details were provided.
The Dubai-based carrier laid off hundreds of pilots and cabin crew on Tuesday in a bid to stave off a cash crunch caused by the coronavirus pandemic, sources told Reuters.
More redundancies were expected this week, including both Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 and Boeing (N:BA) 777 pilots, the sources said on Tuesday.
Those who lost their jobs were told their positions had been made redundant, the sources said.
Aviation is one of the industries worst hit by the fallout from the virus outbreak, with airlines around the world laying off staff and seeking government bailouts.
The state carrier had said in May a promise by the Dubai government to provide Emirates with new equity would allow it to ""preserve its skilled workforce.""
Emirates has since said it could take it up to four years to resume flights to all 157 destinations it flew to before the pandemic. 
The airline has operated limited, mostly outbound services from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since grounding passenger flights in March, but is due to restart some connecting flights this month after the UAE lifted a suspension.

Emirates Group, the state holding company that includes the airline, has also seen lay offs at its airport services company dnata.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Wednesday, rebounding after Tuesday’s sharp losses, but trading ranges are likely to be tight ahead of the conclusion of the latest policy meeting of the Federal Reserve.
At 2:00 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.9% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the UK rose 0.3%.
Although the major European indices saw losses of between 1.5% and 2% on Tuesday, the tone of late has been positive. The DAX has gained over 16% over the last month, the CAC 40 over 13% and the FTSE 100 around 6%. 
In the U.S. the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has posted an all-time high and the broader-based S&P 500briefly traded in positive territory for the year as a whole.
This has been based on optimism over a global recovery from the coronavirus crisis, as well as coordinated monetary and fiscal stimulus from central banks and governments.
With this in mind, investors will be keeping a keen eye on the Federal Reserve as the U.S. central bank concludes its policy meeting later in the day.
While no major policy announcements are expected, investors will scrutinize its remarks on the health of the economy, the world’s largest, particularly after the recent upturn in jobs numbers.
In corporate news, the region’s banks could be in focus Wednesday following a report that the European Central Bank is looking at a scheme to cope with potentially hundreds of billions of euros of unpaid loans in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reported.
The project is aimed at shielding commercial banks from staggering amounts of debt that is considered unlikely to be repaid, particularly if rising unemployment chokes off the income needed to do so.
Oil prices sold off Wednesday, weighed by the American Petroleum Institute’s surprise estimate of an 8.4-million-barrel build for the week ended June 5 late Tuesday, prompting renewed fears of a supply glut.
Investors will now look closely at the Energy Information Administration’s prediction, due later in the day.
At 2:00 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% lower at $38.37 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1% to $40.76.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,725.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1364, up 0.2%.

Some investors suggested that a pullback in a record rally that pumped $21 trillion into global stocks could be imminent.
“It would be no great surprise to see a period of market consolidation now as investors await decisive news on the coronavirus front to determine the direction of the next big market moves,” Paul O’Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson Investors, told Bloomberg.

The investment in Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies will expand production lines for bulk drug substances and cultivate cells for producing viral vaccines, Fujifilm announced on Tuesday. It bought the facility in Hillerod, Denmark, in August from Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) for about $890 million.
The investment expands Fujifilm's presence as a global contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO), which supplies other companies in the pharma industry. Fujifilm started to diversify from cameras and office equipment and into healthcare more than a decade ago.
Fujifilm previously announced that the Denmark site would offer future manufacturing capacity to the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator to speed-up the response to the global pandemic.
It is an initiative launched by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and two other large charities, aimed at accelerating drug development and identifying a promising COVID-19 therapeutic candidate based on efficacy and safety data demonstrated in clinical trials.
Fujifilm's pharma arm is testing its own anti-flu drug Avigan as a treatment for COVID-19.
The company aims to achieve 100 billion yen ($928.68 million) in sales in its bio-CDMO business by the fiscal year ending March 2022. 

Fujifilm shares rose 0.7% in Tokyo versus a 0.2% gain in the broader market.

The lawsuit filed by law firm Slater and Gordon against Australia's largest bank claims that customers were charged for worthless products. 
The class action follows similar lawsuits against Australia's three other big banks as the financial sector continues to face scrutiny in the aftermath of a damaging public inquiry into the widespread misconduct in the sector. 
""Slater and Gordon is still being contacted by large numbers of Commonwealth Bank customers who should never have been sold the products, yet have never been remediated,"" Slater and Gordon practice group leader Andrew Paull said in a statement.
A CBA spokesperson said the bank had not been served with legal proceedings but that it would consider any allegations once it has the lawsuit in hand.
Similar lawsuits against Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) were filed in February, while National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) reached a A$49.5-million ($34.37 million) settlement in a class action lawsuit in November.

341,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>",Chinese companies put U.S. listing plans on ice as tensions mount,"By Engen Tham and Scott Murdoch
SHANGHAI/HONGKONG (Reuters) - Chinese companies are putting off plans for U.S. listings as tensions between the world's top two economies rise, lawyers, bankers, accountants and regulators involved in what has been a major capital-raising route told Reuters. 
The drop in interest, especially from those in the early stages of planning, is the result of a proposed U.S. legislation that would make it harder for some Chinese firms to debut in America and mounting scrutiny following an accounting scandal at Chinese Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) rival  Luckin Coffee  (O:LK).
""We have seen clients putting their U.S. IPO plans on hold for now,"" said Stephen Chan, a partner at law firm Dechert LLP in Hong Kong. ""The underlying reason for the slowdown is the relationship between the U.S. and China,"" he added. 
""If tensions between the two nations remain, we would expect the slowdown to continue,"" Chan said.
Chinese groups have raised $1.67 billion via initial public offerings in New York this year and are looking to raise about half billion more on U.S. exchanges, Dealogic data shows.
In 2019, they raised $3.5 billion.
Sino-U.S. relations have nosedived in recent months with the countries, already at odds over trade, now butting heads over the COVID-19 pandemic and China's proposed national security law for Hong Kong.
Enquiries about U.S. listings have halved this year at one of the big four accounting firms in China versus 2019 levels, a senior auditor from the firm said. 
Many companies that reported plans for U.S. listings to China's securities regulator, marking an early stage in the process, are now targeting exchanges nearer to home, said a person close to the regulator.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not respond to requests for comment, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.
Listings take at the minimum several months to arrange, involving appointing advisers, preparing a prospectus and obtaining regulatory approvals. The further along the path a company is, the less likely it is to change plans.
'INVESTOR UNCERTAINTY'
Chinese firms accounted for about a third, or some $279 billion, of funds raised globally via IPOs in the past five years. About half of that was overseas, mostly through New York and Hong Kong floats.
There are more than 550 Chinese firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Chinese firms often choose New York for floats given its prestige and international investor base, even as Beijing seeks to encourage them to list at home to share gains among local investors and limit foreign oversight.
Chinese authorities have long resisted audit papers leaving China, making it hard for U.S. auditing regulators to check the quality of audits of Chinese companies. 
But a bill passed by the U.S. Senate which, if signed by President Donald Trump, would require U.S.-listed foreign companies to disclose levels of government control. It would also require that Chinese companies comply with U.S. oversight of their audits or face being delisted.
""For U.S. investors, it will mean fewer listings and it will be harder to capture the benefits of growth in China,"" said John Ott, partner with Bain & Company and a leader with its Greater China financial services practice.
U.S.-listed Chinese firms have begun disclosing the risk of an ""adverse impact"" on their shares due to tighter regulations.
 Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Ltd  (O:KC), the first Chinese firm to brave New York since Luckin's scandal, warned efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information ""could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers, including us"".

Netease (O:NTES) and JD.com (O:JD) also warned of similar risks in their recent filings with the Hong Kong stock exchange for secondary listings in the city.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) said it expects to repay the Hong Kong government for HK$19.5 billion ($2.52 billion) of preference shares over a three to five year period.
The shares are part of a $5 billion recapitalisation package announced on Tuesday to help the airline weather the coronavirus crisis, which the International Air Transport Association estimates will cost the industry a record $84 billion in 2020.
The notes carry a coupon rate of 3% for the first three years, rising to 5% in year four, 7% in year five and 9% in year six, giving the airline an incentive to redeem them.
""We would certainly be expecting to repay that over a 3-5 year period,"" Chief Financial Officer Martin Murray said in an analyst briefing posted to the airline's website late Tuesday.
Murray said the package, which also includes a HK$11.7 billion rights issue to current shareholders including Swire Pacific Ltd (HK:0019), Air China (OTC:AIRYY) Ltd (SS:601111) and Qatar Airways, would more than halve the airline's gearing levels.
""That in turn restores access to both the equity and debt market and allows us to tap that market later in the year or next year for equity and debt,"" he said.
The Hong Kong government could gain a 6% stake in Cathay via HK$1.95 billion of warrants convertible to shares. Finance Secretary Paul Chan said on Tuesday it was not the goverment's intention to remain a long-term shareholder in Cathay.
Swire, which owns 45% of Cathay, has agreed to remain a controlling shareholder for as long as the government owns preference shares or any amount of a HK$7.8 billion bridging loan remains outstanding.
Daiwa analyst Kelvin Lau told clients he expected the airline's share price to come under pressure because of the potential 43% dilution from the recapitalisation package.

Pompeo said the United States stood ready to help Britain with alternatives after Beijing reportedly threatened to punish HSBC and break commitments to build nuclear power plants in the country unless it allowed China's Huawei Technologies  to build its 5G network.
""The United States stands with our allies and partners against the Chinese Communist Party’s coercive bullying tactics,"" Pompeo said in a statement, his latest swipe at China's ruling party.
Pompeo said the CCP’s ""browbeating"" of HSBC ""should serve as a cautionary tale"" and referred to the bank’s Asia-Pacific CEO, Peter Wong, signing a petition supporting Beijing’s plans to impose new security legislation on Hong Kong 
""That show of fealty seems to have earned HSBC little respect in Beijing, which continues to use the bank’s business in China as political leverage against London,"" he said.
U.S.-China ties have deteriorated rapidly since the start of the year over the coronavirus pandemic and Hong Kong. Washington sees Huawei as an extension of the Chinese government and urges European allies to exclude it from mobile networks.
Pompeo said Australia, Denmark, ""and other free nations"" had faced pressure from Beijing and it showed why countries needed to avoid economic overreliance on China and to guard their critical infrastructure from CCP influence. 
""Free nations deal in true friendship and desire mutual prosperity, not political and corporate kowtows,"" he said.
Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported on Saturday that HSBC Chairman Mark Tucker had warned Britain against a ban on networking equipment made by Huawei, claiming the bank could face reprisals in China.

Senior British and U.S. politicians criticized HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) last week after they both backed the national security law for Hong Kong.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Investors brace for market swings as Trump slips in election polls,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. presidential election is re-emerging as a potential risk to markets after a shift in polls that has seen President Donald Trump lose ground to Democrat Joe Biden.
Concerns over election-fueled volatility have regained prominence in recent weeks, even as broader market swings have subsided and stocks have surged. Futures on the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge,"" show a visible bump in volatility expectations near the election.
Election-related risk captured in VIX futures has risen to about three times the levels seen ahead of the 2012 and 2016 elections based on the spread between September and October futures, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. VIX futures reflect volatility expectations for the month-long period after their expiration.
(GRAPHIC: As coronavirus risk recedes, election risk rises - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/qmypmoqmbpr/eikon.png) 
Contributing to investors' election concerns are polls showing that Trump's standing among voters has eroded amid criticism over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as the protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in police custody. 
A Democratic victory could threaten policies championed by Trump and generally favored by Wall Street, including lower corporate tax rates and fewer regulations, analysts said. 
""A potential victory by Joe Biden ... and to a greater extent, a 'Democratic sweep,' are generally considered more market-unfriendly outcomes,"" analysts at BofA Global Research said in a recent note to clients.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted June 8-9 showed that Biden, the former vice president and presumptive Democratic nominee, led Trump, a Republican, by 8 percentage points among registered voters. The poll also found that 39% of the American public approves of the president's performance in office, while 57% disapproves.
In a separate poll last week, more than 55% of Americans said they disapproved of Trump's handling of the protests. 
The closely-watched betting site PredictIt put Biden 9 points ahead of Trump, compared with a 6-point lead for Trump a month ago.
""I don't believe we'll get to the election without a substantial spike in volatility,"" said James McDonald, chief executive of hedge fund Hercules Investments. 
McDonald expects election-related trades to ramp up in the weeks just before the Nov. 3 general election and plans to deploy options and futures strategies that take advantage of volatility spikes once the results come in.
The election-related concerns stand in contrast to a recent easing in broader market volatility: the VIX has fallen to its lowest levels since late February, while the S&P 500 (SPX) has climbed 44% from its March 23 closing low. 
(Graphic: Positioning for U.S. election volatility - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvggyajvq/April%20-%202020%20election%20positioning%20reflected%20in%20VIX%20futures%20curve.png) 
Taxes have been one major area of contrast between the two presidential contenders. Biden has criticized Trump's 2017 tax decreases and pledged to reverse some of those cuts, a move that could weigh on companies that benefited from the legislation. 
Analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have estimated that Biden's tax reform, if enacted, would reduce earnings for S&P 500 companies by around $20 a share in 2021, to $150 a share.
Netflix Inc (O:NFLX),  Visa Inc  (N:V) and Salesforce.com Inc (N:CRM) are among the companies that have received a bigger than average benefit from the 2017 tax reform, the bank said. 
A Trump win, on the other hand, could raise concerns over the continuation of a U.S.-China trade war that has periodically roiled markets over the last several years.
Trump has already taken a harsher tone on China in recent weeks, a move some analysts believe is intended to shore up support among the president's voter base.

Financial and technology-related stocks have been particularly sensitive in the past to threats of increased regulation and restrictions on trade with China, and those sectors may again grow more volatile as the election approaches, said Amy Wu Silverman, equity derivatives strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

CME said all its other trading pits, which were shuttered after the market closed on March 13, would remain closed until Chicago, where they are based, reached Phase 5 of its reopening plans.
""As the coronavirus crisis remains fluid, the company will continue to monitor the situation and communicate any changes as needed,"" the company said in a statement.

The move comes as U.S. states push forward with reopening as overall infection rates from the coronavirus trend lower, helping to spur a massive rally in the U.S. stock market.
More than 110,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus.
The New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), partially reopened its trading floors at 11 Wall Street on May 26.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Bow Street LLC is close to having eight directors elected to the board of  Mack-Cali Realty Corp  (N:CLI), which would give the hedge fund control of the real estate investment trust's board, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
All votes have not been cast before Wednesday's annual meeting and the results could still change. But preliminary numbers show Bow Street's entire eight-member slate will be elected to the 11-strong board, the sources said.
The slate includes four directors who were elected to the board last year but were not renominated by the company and four others, including Akiva Katz, one of Bow Street's co-founders.
A representative for Bow Street declined to comment and a representative for Mack-Cali could not immediately be reached.
Bow Street, which owns 4.9% of the company, has been pushing for operational changes and the ouster of Mack-Cali's chief executive.
Proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis & Co and Egan Jones backed the hedge fund's call for an overhaul at Mack-Cali with recommendations to elect a large number of Bow Street's proposed directors.
The outcome is likely to be seen as a sharp rebuke to Mack-Cali Chief Executive Michael DeMarco's stewardship. DeMarco and two other incumbent board members will not be seeking re-election, making for an unusual situation where a company's CEO is not a member of the board.
This year's proxy contest follows on the heels of an earlier campaign waged last year, when Bow Street nominated and investors elected four independent directors.
Those directors spoke out about board matters last month. They said other board members had dismissed them as being instruments of the hedge fund, and that they saw other directors simply rubber stamp the CEO's decisions.

The company said it was planning to reopen almost all its U.S. and UK theaters in July, in time to showcase Christopher Nolan's upcoming film ""Tenet"" slated for release on July 17 and Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) ""Mulan"" on July 24.
The world's largest movie theater operator recently flagged ""substantial doubts"" about its ability to continue operations, if forced to keep its theaters closed for a longer period due to social distancing measures.
Much like most other out-of-home entertainment businesses, movie theater chains have felt the impact of lockdowns and social distancing measures, which further added to challenges due to a broader consumer shift to streaming services.
AMC's total revenue fell 21.6% to $941.5 million in the quarter ended March 31, compared with analysts' average estimate of $951.4 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net loss widened to $2.18 billion, largely due to an impairment charge of about $1.85 billion related to assets and goodwill.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow fell on Tuesday, pausing after recent strong gains as focus shifted to the Federal Reserve, while the Nasdaq ended at an all-time high for a second straight day after briefly rising above the 10,000 mark for the first time.
The Fed began a two-day meeting. While no major policy announcements are expected when the U.S. central bank wraps up on Wednesday, investors will scrutinize its remarks on the health of the economy, which has been reopening after coronavirus-related closures.
The Nasdaq's gains came on the back of strong gains in tech-related shares, a day after the index became the first of Wall Street's major indexes to confirm a new bull market. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), up 3.2%, gave the Nasdaq its biggest boost on Tuesday.
The benchmark S&P 500 fell back into negative territory for the year after temporarily erasing those losses on Monday.
""It strikes me as maybe a reflexive selloff as a result of a tremendous rally over the past week. There's no news headline that screams bearish catalyst to me. But conversely, other than the nonfarm payrolls data, the past two weeks haven't had super bullish catalysts either,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management in New York. 
""In the grand scheme of things, it seems like the market has caught a bullish fever, and it's feeding on itself."" 
The rally in U.S. stocks accelerated last week after strikingly upbeat May jobs data strengthened views that the worst of the economic fallout from the pandemic was over.
Financial and industrial shares, which have been among stocks that have surged in recent weeks on hopes of an improved economic outlook, were the biggest drags on the benchmark S&P 500 on Tuesday.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 300.14 points, or 1.09%, to 27,272.3, the S&P 500 lost 25.21 points, or 0.78%, to 3,207.18 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.01 points, or 0.29%, to 9,953.75.
U.S. financial market operators, including the New York Stock Exchange, held a moment of silence in honor of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American who died on May 25 after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The S&P 1500 airlines index tumbled 7.5%, while cruise operators Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd fell following their recent sharp recovery amid recent signs of a pickup in global travel.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.84-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 10 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 56 new highs and one new low.

Investing.com - Technology stocks drove the Nasdaq Composite briefly above 10,000 on Tuesday, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke its six-day advance ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate announcement.
The Nasdaq settled below the psychologically significant 10,000 level, but still at another record high as giant stocks like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) surged. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) also rose.
Investors paused after a multiday rally to await the Fed's statement, which is scheduled to be released on Wednesday. A number of economic data points also come out, including information on consumer prices and oil inventories.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Investors Await the Fed's Statement
The Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting ends Wednesday and investors expect the central bank to continue its support for the economy as it begins to emerge from the Covid-19 shutdowns.
Interest rates are expected to remain unchanged, but the Fed's statement could outline what it sees as risks to economic growth.
The Fed, along with the Treasury and Congress, have pumped trillions in stimulus to support businesses that were forced to shut down because of Covid-19.
2. Consumer Price Data Also Set for Release
The consumer price index data for May will be released at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). The forecast is for CPI to grow 0.2% in May compared to the same month last year, but to decline 0.1% since April amid Covid shutdowns. Total consumer prices fell 0.8% in April, the sharpest drop since the end of 2008 after energy prices plummeted.
Core CPI, which excludes energy and food prices, is expected to increase 1.3% since last May but drop 0.1% since April.
3. Weekly Oil Inventories Could Propel Oil Price
Weekly data on crude oil inventories are also due out Wednesday at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT). The expectation is for a decline of 1.74 million barrels for the week ending June 5 compared to a decline of just over 2 million barrels the previous week.
Gasoline inventories are also expected to fall 71,000 barrels compared to a gain of 2.8 million barrels. Oil prices have surged over the last few weeks as business activity resumes, after plummeting earlier this spring on a drop of demand related to Covid shutdowns."

Investing.com - Wall Street ended off session lows despite late selling Tuesday, as gains in technology and expectations for the Federal Reserve to reiterate its accommodative stance on monetary policy kept losses in the broader market in check.   
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.09%, or 300 points, the S&P 500 slipped 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.29% to rise to another record high.
The Federal Reserve kicked off its two-day meeting on Tuesday and is widely expected to stand pat on interest rates but reiterate its readiness to roll out more stimulus to ensure an eventual economic recovery will be robust.  
At its previous meeting, the Fed recently floated the idea of using yield curve control, which allows central banks to target specific government bond yield through the purchase and sale of bonds, to help keep lending rates near zero.
Beyond monetary policy, investor appetite for growth stocks returned with FAANG stocks catching a bid, led by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).  
Apple jumped 3.16% as investors cheered a report suggesting the tech giant is set to begin production of iPhone 12 in July.
The general malaise in the broader market was paced by a slump in energy amid falling oil prices as investors appeared to take some profit on names in the sector that have jumped sharply recently.
Apache (NYSE:APA), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), and Marathon Oil  (NYSE:MRO), all of which are up more than 30% over the past five days, fell sharply, with the latter down 9.19%.
The reopening trade – bullish bets on stocks tied to the progress of the economic reopening – took a breather, with travel and tourism stocks down sharply.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) fell 8.8%, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) slid 7.75%, and Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) slipped 5.5%.

However, it resumed trading post-midday without any announcement and triggered circuit-breakers with its steep fall.
In a dramatic day for the company on Monday, Chesapeake stock more than tripled in value, triggering 22 volatility halts before closing up 182%.

356,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexico's tax chief eyes criminal charges as path to tougher corporate enforcement,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's tax chief is preparing to press criminal charges against some of the biggest companies operating in the country as part of an enforcement crusade, telling Reuters that officials had opened ""four or five"" cases of tax fraud this year alone.
The campaign has already squeezed hundreds of millions of dollars from retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Mexico unit (MX:WALMEX) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bottler Femsa , with other firms under scrutiny in the country with the lowest take in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
Raquel Buenrostro, chief of the Tax Administration Service (SAT), said past administrations were too lenient with powerful firms, depriving the government of needed income.
""There was tax fraud in the past, and it never led to criminal procedures,"" Buenrostro said on Monday in an interview at her spartan office, decorated with a Mexican flag and a framed photo of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.
""Executives now know that if they commit tax fraud, we will have to open a criminal procedure,"" Buenrostro said.
She declined to reveal which companies were facing criminal charges, but said the biggest debtors were in industries including steel, food, autos, pharmaceuticals, finance, mining, retail and energy.
Lopez Obrador tapped Buenrostro as tax chief in January, after she earned a reputation as a trusted aide - along with the nickname 'Iron Lady' - during a clampdown on federal procurement that cut spending by $9 billion in a year.
The president, a leftist, runs a tight budget and has promised no new taxes for three years. Instead he wants to increase revenue through more efficient collection and has threatened to expose 15 companies he says owe a total of $2 billion. 
On Tuesday he said Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) was bringing its payments up to date, but that some Canadian mining companies were seeking international arbitration rather than pay what the government said they owed. It was not clear if they were on the president's list of 15 companies behind on taxes. 
Toyota did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Buenrostro said the list of 15 represented just a handful of the companies in arrears.
When asked how many criminal complaints had been opened against large companies, Buenrostro said: ""From big taxpayers we have four or five... for tax fraud, this year, plus others that have accumulated.""
She did not say how many overall companies were targeted in the new complaints.
Walmart de Mexico paid $358 million to the SAT last month after negotiations over matters including the 2014 sale of a restaurant chain. The company said the amount was arrived at in collaboration with the SAT.
Walmart de Mexico's corporate affairs director previously said the retailer did not have knowledge of a criminal complaint. The company declined to comment in response to questions from Reuters on Tuesday.
Mexican conglomerate Femsa, one of the world's largest Coca-Cola bottlers, followed days later with its own agreement with the SAT, pledging to pay $398 million. The company said the payment resolved interpretative differences over taxes paid outside Mexico.
Femsa was not presented with a criminal charge, a corporate communications representative said. 
Buenrostro said she welcomed reaching a deal with companies without resorting to charges.
""Our aim is not to send people to jail,"" she said.
Buenrostro declined to say whether Walmart and Femsa were threatened with, or faced, criminal charges.
The strategy appears to be yielding results. Large taxpayers forked over more than 50 billion pesos ($2.3 billion) in total from January to May, compared with only 37 billion pesos during all of last year.
Buenrostro also said the SAT, with 1,300 audits underway, has focused on cases where it was confident of proving a tax obligation, rather than entering the complicated world of tax law interpretation. 
The SAT is reviewing recent transactions, typically from within the past five to seven years, she said. 
""We selected not only the biggest debts, but also the easiest ones to recover,"" Buenrostro said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Communications Commission on Tuesday voted unanimously to propose a record-setting $225 million fine against Texas-based health insurance telemarketers for allegedly making approximately 1 billion illegal robocalls.
The order named John C. Spiller II, and Jakob Mears, using businesses, including Rising Eagle and JSquared Telecom. The FCC said robocalls falsely claimed to offer health insurance plans from major health insurance companies such as Aetna (NYSE:AET), Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna (NYSE:CI), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH).
The pair could not immediately be reached for comment.
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said Rising Eagle ""primarily used spoofed Caller ID numbers to flood consumers with prerecorded calls that... misled consumers into thinking that the calls were from well-known and reputable health insurance providers."" 
Instead, consumers were offered ""short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans offered by lesser known entities— a far cry from expectations.""
Separately, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, joined by the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, on Tuesday sued the pair, along with their Texas-based companies Rising Eagle Capital Group LLC and JSquared Telecom LLC, in U.S. District Court in Texas for violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.
Paxton said over the past two years, Spiller and Mears initiated billions of abusive robocalls through the two companies. The calls, made both to residential and cellular phone, ""confront consumers with pre-recorded messages pitching healthcare products or automobile extended warranties."" 
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel backed the effort but said the FCC had not been able to collect a significant portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars in total robocall fines levied previously.
""So far collections on these eye-popping fines have netted next to nothing,"" she said, saying the FCC needs assistance from the Justice Department to collect.

361,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>","Shareholders of Bankrupt J.C. Penney Get a $250,000 Lifeline","(Bloomberg) -- J.C. Penney Co. shareholders got a helping hand Tuesday from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones.
Jones will order the retailer to pay as much as $250,000 in professional fees to support an informal group of shareholders who have been challenging the bankruptcy, he said in a hearing Tuesday. In exchange, the group of retail investors agreed to nix its attempt to have the whole case thrown out along with its request for status as an official group, which could’ve resulted in huge legal bills for J.C. Penney.
Shareholders typically get no recovery in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but the legal fights that result from pugnacious stockholders can slow down a case and hurt recoveries for creditors. Jones said he views the compromise as a way to help educate shareholders on where the case is headed and how bankruptcy works.
“I’m looking at this as a very reasonable expenditure to further education and promote discussion,” Jones said. “It’s not a war chest.”
The news comes on the heels of a head-scratching surge in the stock prices of J.C. Penney and other bankrupt companies. Some of the retailer’s bonds, which rank well above shares in the repayment line, were recently preliminarily valued at just 1.375 cents on the dollar in a credit-default swap auction, implying extremely slim odds of any payout to equity investors.
Still, J.C. Penney shareholders have been active participants in its bankruptcy proceedings to date. Several have asked questions during hearings, including cross-examining witnesses and pleading with Jones to prevent a wipeout of the stock. In court papers, the informal stockholder group decried recent bonus payments to executives and insisted that bankruptcy could’ve been avoided.
“If there is any possible way -- any way -- to give a meaningful recovery to shareholders, we will fight for it,” Joshua Sussberg of Kirkland & Ellis, J.C. Penney’s bankruptcy lawyer, said in the hearing. But he added that not filing for bankruptcy “would have left the company on a desolate island without a chance for survival.”

364,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Boeing jet deliveries sink to just four in May,"By Eric M. Johnson and Rachit Vats
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) deliveries slowed even further in May from April as the coronavirus pandemic's crushing impact on airlines added to a year of crisis following the grounding of its 737 MAX planes, company data showed on Tuesday.
The U.S. planemaker said it handed over just four planes in May, down from the six it delivered in April, its lowest total for the month in six decades and about 87% fewer than it delivered to customers at the same time a year ago.
Deliveries are financially important to planemakers because airlines pay most of the purchase price when they actually receive the plane.
Customers also canceled orders for another 18 planes last month, including 14 MAX jets that were the company's top-selling plane until a pair of crashes just over a year ago.
While Boeing resumed production last week and expects to make deliveries of the MAX in the third quarter, many aircraft leasing companies and airlines, including Southwest Airlines (N:LUV), United Airlines (O:UAL), and Brazil's GOL (SA:GOLL4) have canceled or deferred delivery as the industry faces a collapse in air travel since January.
Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported Emirates, one of the world's biggest long-haul airlines, laid off hundreds of pilots and thousands of cabin crew.
Boeing shares fell more than 3% by the early afternoon.
Boeing did score nine new orders for wide body planes and its deliveries included two 777 freighters, one 737 NG (Next Generation)-based aircraft for the U.S. military and one 767 freighter, but no passenger planes.
The May cancellations came from a host of aircraft-leasing firms, including three from Aviation Capital Group, one from CIT Aviation, four from  General Electric  Co's (N:GE) leasing division and six unidentified customers.
Leasing firms, which control over 40% of the global fleet, are among the largest MAX customers.
After further accounting adjustments representing jets ordered in previous years but now unlikely to be delivered, Boeing's adjusted net orders sank to a negative 602 airplanes.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Volkswagen CEO apologises after row with supervisory board,"By Ilona Wissenbach and Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) CEO Herbert Diess has apologised to the carmaker's supervisory board after accusing some of its members of leaking confidential information to the press.
The German company said on Tuesday that Diess had apologised to the 19-member board for making ""inappropriate and wrong"" statements at an internal event, without giving details.
A spokesman for Porsche Automobil Holding SE, the holding company of the Piech and Porsche families that controls Volkswagen, said Diess told an internal meeting that members of the supervisory board's executive committee had leaked information to the media, calling such actions ""crimes.""
The CEO's comments on Thursday were seen as an attack on the company's directors, prompting the supervisory board to convene an extraordinary meeting on Monday to discuss the matter, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
The public announcement https://www.volkswagenag.com/content/onkomm/brands/corporate/world/presence/en/news/2020/06/Supervisory_Board_accepts_apology_of_Dr_Herbert_Diess.html of his apology amounts to a severe admonishment of Diess, who saw his responsibilities reduced on Monday after infighting over the pace and scope of cost-cutting plans.
""The members of the Supervisory Board accepted the apology of Dr. Diess, and will continue to support him in his work,"" the board said in a brief statement.
The two sources told Reuters that Diess's accusations came after Germany's Manager Magazin reported he had sounded out labour chief Joerg Hofmann about extending his contract as CEO. 
Hofmann, who is head of Germany's largest union IG Metall, sits on the Volkswagen supervisory board's executive committee. Volkswagen's worker representatives control nine seats on the board, and have the power to veto contract extensions.
A spokesman for the supervisory board declined to comment on the details of the clash, apart from saying it was not related to a review into how the company came to publish a racist advert.
Spokespeople for Diess and Hofmann also declined to comment.
Volkswagen replaced Diess as the CEO of its main VW brand on Monday and installed chief operating officer Ralf Brandstaetter to lead cost cutting efforts at the company's largest plants in Germany.
The carmaker employs 297,000 people in Germany, most of them at the VW brand. Its other brands include Audi, Bentley, Skoda, Lamborghini and Porsche. 
Diess remains group CEO, a position he has held since 2018.
The incident appears to follow a pattern at the carmaker where board members lose backing if their cost cutting and efficiency measures threaten too many local jobs, prompting the company's powerful labour leaders to flex their muscles. 

Bernd Pischetsrieder, Volkswagen CEO from 2002-2006, and Wolfgang Bernhard, VW brand chief from 2005-2007 were forced out of their jobs after repeated clashes with VW's works council.

Britain has already begun slowly opening for business after shuttering large swathes of the economy and ordering citizens to stay at home on March 23 to limit the spread of COVID-19 as the disease threatened to overwhelm the health system.
The announcement, which will only apply in England because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own policy on lockdown restrictions, had previously been announced, subject to sufficient progress against the coronavirus being made.

""This is the latest step in the careful restarting of our economy and will enable high streets up and down the country to spring back to life,"" Sharma told reporters.

370,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Savings surge forces Goldman to shut Marcus to new UK clients,"By Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is closing its easy access savings business to new customers in Britain from Wednesday after deposits surged near to regulatory limits during the coronavirus lockdown. 
The British arm of digital brand Marcus, which pays market-leading rates to savers starved of meaningful cash returns, has attracted about 21 billion pounds ($27 billion) from more than 500,000 savers since its launch in 2018.
However, British banking rules demanding ring-fencing of retail deposits totalling more than 25 billion pounds have prompted its executives to take steps to manage its growth.
""We've really seen our growth accelerate under lockdown as people hold off on discretionary spending and take time to reorganise their finances and get the best deal for their money,"" Des McDaid, head of Marcus UK, told Reuters.
Ring-fencing would require Marcus in Britain to become a separate legal entity with its own board and limit how much capital it could share with the rest of Goldman's businesses. 
""Separating Marcus financially and operationally from Goldman Sachs would be a significant change to our low-cost business model, which allows us to pay consistently competitive rates to existing savers,"" McDaid added.
Several British bank executives have said the brand named after Marcus Goldman, co-founder of the Wall Street investment bank, is one of the most potent ""disruptors"" in the market.
An analysis last month by think-tank New Policy Institute estimated that British households had cut their spending by 57 billion pounds since lockdown began on March 23.
McDaid said that Marcus had achieved inflows of more than 8 billion pounds from about 100,000 new account holders since January, and by 4 billion pounds since the lockdown began, suggesting that a significant slice of household income is being saved.
Marcus has helped Goldman to diversify into consumer banking and provided billions of dollars of cheaper deposit-based funding to fuel its investment banking activities.
Goldman was committed to the retail savings market in Britain and was on track to launch an app and tax-efficient Individual Savings Account this year, McDaid said, adding that its 12-month fixed-rate account is still open to new savers. 
The temporary shutdown could represent a blow to millions of savers in Britain by cutting competition and reducing pressure on other banks to match its rates.
Finance product provider Moneyfacts.co.uk last week warned consumers to brace for a ""race to the bottom"" on savings rates and products after average rates on easy access accounts hit record lows.

Marcus remains open for new accounts in the United States, where total deposits in the first quarter stood at more than $50 billion, up from $42 billion at the end of 2019.

374,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 11:27AM ET</span>",The Smart Money Is Finally Ready to Chase the Mom-and-Pop Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- After one of the fastest stock rebounds in history, the so-called smart money finally looks ready to follow the not-so dumb.
A key Wall Street metric shows discretionary hedge funds are raising their U.S. equity exposures from historic lows, just as their quantitative peers add fresh ammo to a $21 trillion rally in the teeth of the economic downturn.
Systematic strategies that take their cues from market swings are set to scoop up $380 million of American shares a day over the next three months if current volatility levels hold, according to BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA. Meanwhile,  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) reckons commodity trading advisers, which use derivatives to follow market trends, are ready to step up in kind.
While U.S. stocks looked set for a breather on Tuesday, optimism is growing over economic re-openings and  Deutsche Bank  AG (NYSE:DB) says institutional cash is now following the trail blazed by the mom-and-pop cohort that has powered the S&P 500’s comeback.
“Retail investors appear to have timed the market well,” BNP Paribas strategists led by Greg Boutle wrote in a note. “A squeeze in short positioning, buying flows from CTAs and target volatility funds could drive a further overshoot in markets.”
The extremity of this year’s market turmoil has played havoc with many systematic strategies, which delevered amid the rout and whose buying signals were then muddied by cross-asset volatility. Meanwhile a slew of hedge funds were hit by redemptions during the selloff and the economic outlook has offered few incentives for risk-taking.
Yet inexperienced retail investors have stayed greedy while the pros were fearful. Discount brokerages like  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. and TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) Holding Corp. for example saw record new accounts opened and trading volume in the first part of the year, as bored millenials played the market via consumer-friendly apps.
On the heels of better-than-expected data, investors are pouring cash into stocks acutely exposed to the economic cycle. They’ve plowed almost $3 billion into exchange-traded funds tracking previously unloved financial shares this month, while yanking more than $2 billion from vehicles following tech companies.
In the wake of upside economic surprises, various breeds of quant will soon be forced to start buying more shares, according to Nomura’s Masanari Takada.
Trend followers known as commodity trading advisers will likely move into equities after dumping their holdings in bond futures, he wrote in a Monday note. Some systematic players may even jump ahead of their usual schedules to play catch-up.
“Some risk-parity funds may embark on emergency rebalancing, selling bonds and buying equities without waiting for the usual month-end timing,” Takada said.
Both systematic and discretionary exposures slumped amid the first quarter turmoil. While that’s starting to pick up, volatility-control, risk parity and long/short hedge funds remain in the single-digit percentiles of their equity positioning, according to Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn).
Tracking the fast money on Wall Street is far from straightforward, but one gauge of exposures -- based on estimates of returns attributable to the benchmark, or beta -- shows hedge fund exposure ticking up, though still well below recent highs.
Data from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG paints a similar picture for macro and CTA funds -- stock exposure has turned higher since late May, but remains historically low.
With both historic and implied volatility continuing to drop, investors that look to market swings for allocation decisions will also start to see green lights flash for stocks, according to BNP Paribas.
The 10-day realized volatility of the S&P 500 Index recently slumped to its lowest since February, dragging the Cboe Volatility Index -- a measure of expected swings -- to 26, well below its average for this year.
The counter argument to all this tentative buying is that the market rebound has gone too far, too fast -- and that fear could yet keep big money on the sidelines.
The world is not yet free from the grip of the coronavirus and the economic fallout remains unknown. Yet the S&P 500 has surged more than 40% off its March low.
No wonder there’s more than $4.7 trillion in money-market funds on haven demand.
“Everything seems to be priced almost to perfection,” Esty Dwek, head of global macro strategy at Natixis Investment Managers, told Bloomberg TV on Monday. “We don’t like to chase this rally. Especially now that sentiment is turning much more bullish and the rally is broadening, there is this question of disappointment risk.”

375,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>",Unite union holds ballot for industrial action at Drax power plant,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's largest union said on Tuesday it would hold a ballot for industrial action later this month over the closure of two coal-fired generation units at  Drax  Group's (L:DRX) Selby power plant in north Yorkshire.
Unite said the ballot will include the option for strike action later in the summer.
Drax Group is planning to close two coal-fired units next April. The other four units are biomass, using wood chip pellets.
The coal-powered units will be potentially replaced by gas generation units, after a judicial review last month.
Unite said that when a pay deal was struck last year, it was agreed that there would be no compulsory redundancies amongst the 600-strong workforce, but the company has now backtracked on the agreement.
Drax said it has been talking to employees and unions for more than two years about the coal unit closures.
""We gave our employees over a year's notice – the job losses will take place in April 2021. This means we have time to support those affected to get the best outcomes for them,"" a spokeswoman said.
Unite said its members voted by 85% to proceed to an industrial action ballot later this month which could give the green light for strike action towards the end of July.
""The management has a window of opportunity to negotiate with Unite for a natural wastage scheme as workers leave the plant's employment,"" Unite's regional officer Shane Sweeting said in a statement.

376,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 11:06AM ET</span>",Airlines heading for $84 billion loss this year: IATA,"By Laurence Frost
PARIS (Reuters) - Airlines are set to lose $84 billion as the coronavirus pandemic reduces revenue by half to mark the worst year in the sector's history, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast on Tuesday. 
With most of the world's airliners currently parked, IATA said revenue would likely fall to $419 billion from $838 billion last year. 
""Every day of this year will add $230 million to industry losses,"" IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said. 
The average loss amounts to almost $38 per passenger flown.
In 2021, IATA warned losses could hit $100 billion as traffic struggles to recover and airlines slash fares to win business.
""Airlines will still be financially fragile in 2021,"" De Juniac said, predicting ""even more intense"" competition.
""That will translate into strong incentives for travellers to take to the skies again,"" he added.
IATA forecast a rise in 2021 revenue to $598 billion.
Airlines are counting the cost of weeks of lost business, a debt pile swollen by bailouts and a diminished demand outlook.
Passenger numbers are seen falling to 2.25 billion this year before rising to 3.38 billion in 2021, still more than 25% below 2019 levels.
Yields, a proxy for fares, are seen falling 18% this year, contributing to a $241 billion decline in passenger revenue.
Cargo, a relatively small share of the overall business, brought some relief as mass plane groundings drove price increases expected to top 30%, IATA said, helping revenue to a near-record $111 billion.
Even in markets where COVID-19 infection rates have fallen sharply, airlines still face a patchwork of travel restrictions and wary consumers.

A 14-day quarantine for arriving passengers introduced by Britain this week has prompted an angry response and legal threats from the travel industry amid reports that it may be loosened in favour of ""air corridors"" to some destinations.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates, one of the world's biggest long-haul airlines, laid off hundreds of pilots and thousands of cabin crew on Tuesday as it manages a cash crunch caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and more job cuts are planned, five company sources said.
Aviation is one of the industries worst hit by the fallout from the virus outbreak, with airlines forced to lay off staff and seek government bailouts.
More redundancies were expected at Emirates this week including both Airbus (PA:AIR) A380 and Boeing (N:BA) 777 pilots, the sources said on the condition of anonymity. 
The workforce of 4,300 pilots and nearly 22,000 cabin crew could shrink by almost a third from its pre-coronavirus levels, three of the sources said. 
Without giving further details, an airline spokeswoman told Reuters some employees had been laid off. 
""Given the significant impact that the pandemic has had on our business, we simply cannot sustain excess resources and have to right size our workforce in line with our reduced operations,"" she said.
A promise by the Dubai government to provide Emirates with new equity would allow it to ""preserve its skilled workforce,"" the state airline said on May 10.
It has since laid off employees, which sources previously told Reuters were trainee pilots and cabin crew.
Outgoing President Tim Clark has said it could take four years for the airline to resume flying to all of the 157 international destinations it served before the pandemic. It has a fleet of 270 A380 and 777 jets.
The airline has operated limited, mostly outbound services from the United Arab Emirates since grounding passenger flights in March but is due to restart some connecting flights after the UAE last week lifted a suspension.
Emirates has also extended pay cuts until September, and in some cases deepened the reduction to 50%, according to an internal email on Sunday.

Companies developing coronavirus vaccines, such as AstraZeneca (L:AZN) and Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), have flagged potential supply shortages of glass vials, which could pose a challenge to scaling up the production of a vaccine. 
Amid surging global demand, billions of vials will be needed for vaccines of the new coronavirus, with world leaders looking towards treatments as a way to re-open stalled economies.
Corning said it would provide priority access of its vials to companies that have tied up with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for developing treatments and vaccines. 

This investment would help Corning scale up its manufacturing at three U.S. facilities. (https://reut.rs/3fd4yyd)

383,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",South African airline SA Express escapes liquidation for now,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African state airline SA Express (NYSE:EXPR) escaped liquidation on Tuesday after a judge granted a three-month delay in liquidation proceedings, giving the government more time to clarify its plans for the domestic and regional carrier.
SA Express, a different business to national flag carrier South African Airways (SAA), was placed under provisional liquidation in April after its administrators said they could not secure funding for turnaround efforts.
But in papers filed in the High Court and seen by Reuters, lawyers for the administrators asked to delay a final ruling on whether it should be liquidated, saying there was a possibility the government could fund a restart of the airline's operations.
They cited a letter from the state enterprises ministry that referred to an allocation of 164 million rand ($10 million) in the financial year that began in April, subject to certain conditions.
The lawyers said that delaying the hearing would allow ""national executives to roll out proper plans"". It would also prevent the airline from losing its operator's certificate and air licence, which could help creditors to recover some money, they added.
The request for a delay was supported by the provisional liquidators, who said they needed more time to study the airline's affairs, as well as some trade unions and creditors.
The NUMSA and SACCA unions issued a statement saying they were vehemently opposed to the airline's liquidation.
SA Express suspended operations in March as the COVID-19 pandemic compounded its financial difficulties. It entered bankruptcy protection in February after losing a court battle with a contractor.
It has not paid salaries since February, prompting some employees to protest.

SAA is also fighting for its survival under bankruptcy protection. The pair have been a drain on the public purse at a time of weak economic growth.

The fund is doing a “quite a bit” of internal work to figure out how to use existing special drawing rights, or SDRs, to replicate the impact of creating more of them, First Managing Director Geoffrey Okamoto said on a conference call on Tuesday. A proposed $500 billion SDR allocation was blocked in April by the IMF’s biggest shareholder, the U.S.
“While I think myself and others would be interested in a general SDR allocation, we are exploring every available option to make sure that we effectively get the benefit of an SDR allocation but with the existing stock that we currently have,” Okamoto said. “There’s quite a bit of internal work being done on this at the moment. I don’t want to preview too much,“ he added.
Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva had previously said that the IMF wants to find ways to get SDRs from rich countries that don’t need them to poorer nations that do.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in April that the Trump administration opposed the plan to create more reserve assets because they are allotted to countries in proportion to their IMF voting share. This means 70% would go to G-20 countries that don’t need the help and just 3% to the poorest developing nations.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>","Tiffany amends debt pacts for financial leeway amid pandemic, slump in sales","By Melissa Fares and Silvia Aloisi
NEW YORK/MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. luxury jeweler  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF), which is being bought by France's LVMH for $16 billion, said on Tuesday it had amended some of its debt agreements to gain more financial leeway amid the coronavirus pandemic after its quarterly sales sank 44%.
The amendments included raising the maximum leverage ratio, which assesses the ability of a company to meet its financial obligations, to 4.5 from 3.5. Some analysts had warned that Tiffany was at breaching its debt covenants in the second quarter.
Tiffany shares were up more than 2 percent in early trading.
Sources have told Reuters that LVMH Chief Executive Bernard Arnault has been exploring ways to potentially pressure Tiffany to lower the agreed price of $135 per share, including by examining its compliance with its debt covenants.
However, Arnault has decided not to renegotiate the agreed price for now, sources told Reuters on Friday. 
The acquisition, scheduled to be completed in mid-2020, has yet to receive some of the necessary regulatory approvals, and LVMH could revisit the issue before the deal closes, especially if Tiffany's financial condition deteriorates..
Tiffany's new debt covenants should lower the risk of breach that could disrupt the LVMH acquisition,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Michael Binetti said. 
An LVMH spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
Tiffany, which also drew $500 million from one of its credit facilities during the first quarter, said it had ample cash on hand and was in compliance with all debt covenants as of April 30.
""I am confident that Tiffany's best days remain ahead of us and I am excited we will be taking that journey with LVMH by our side,"" Tiffany CEO Alessandro Bogliolo said in a statement.
The company's comparable sales, which strip out the effects of currency exchange rates, tumbled in the three months to April 30, as the pandemic gutted demand for its jewelry and forced it to shut the bulk of its 300 stores across the globe. 
Based in New York and best known for its diamond engagement rings, Tiffany faces further headwinds in the next few months as the health emergency has plunged major economies into recession and brought international tourism to a halt. 
""The biggest challenge will be getting past the absence of events like weddings that have been lost or postponed,"" said NPD Chief Analyst Marshal Cohen. ""These gift-driving events are hard to lose as a retailer.""
Those problems have been compounded in recent weeks by widespread U.S. protests that included some incidents of shop looting following the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, after a white police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. 
Net sales nearly halved to $555.5 million in the first quarter, while it posted a loss of $64.6 million compared with a profit of $125.2 million a year earlier. 

Tiffany said sales were on a recovery path in the key Chinese market, which began emerging from the coronavirus lockdown earlier than the United States and Europe, although revenues were still down 40% globally in May.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The Europe Union will seek tougher checks on foreign state-owned or state-backed companies buying European firms to prevent the use of unfair subsidies, the EU antitrust chief said on Tuesday, the latest move to increase protection.
The bloc's protectionist trend has accelerated as it strives to create European industrial champions and because of concerns wealthy foreigners might swoop on companies whose value has been reduced by the coronavirus crisis.
Margrethe Vestager said in an interview foreign companies use subsidies without the European Union's knowledge or checks.
""There is a high risk that they will fragment the single market or un-level the playing field,"" she said.
Vestager will next week present a proposal, known as the white paper on foreign subsidies, to tighten checks.
EU governments and the European Parliament will subsequently specify which EU interests could be harmed by foreign subsidies.
European companies with foreign state-backed shareholders could be investigated, she said, citing an old case of a tyre maker bought by a Chinese company, which was able to appear more competitive than rival European bidders because of its state subsidies, although this was never proved.
""I think it's only appropriate that we also do our best when they (European companies) are met with unfair competition even in Europe because competitors here may have access to foreign subsidies,"" Vestager said.
Vestager, who has approved EU state aid totalling more than 2 trillion euros to coronavirus-hit companies in the last two months, said carefully-monitored EU support differed from subsidies used by foreign companies.
""We know what is going on. We also know that it's temporary in character, this is what characterises these many different issues,"" she said. 

""We know they are needed and the decisions we take minimise the risks of fragmentation of the single market and none of that is the case for foreign subsidies.""

392,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 09:46AM ET</span>",EU says UK trade talks will shape bloc's stock market,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union will only decide how to reform its share trading rules once it knows whether exchanges in Britain will have access to the bloc after a post-Brexit transition period ends in December, a senior EU official said on Tuesday.
The EU and Britain have clashed over the bloc's ""share trading obligation"", or STO, which mandates where investors in the EU must trade specific stocks.
One UK exchange has accused the EU of a ""land grab"" in trying to steal market share from London, where heavy volumes are traded in companies whose main listing is in the EU.
""We have to wait (to find out) what the result of the negotiations between the EU and UK will look like before we take a considered view on how to structure our various trading obligations,"" Tilman Lueder, a senior official in the European Commission's financial services unit, told a webinar held by exchanges industry body FESE.
Carsten Ostermann, a policy officer at the EU's markets regulator ESMA, said there was consensus on reducing the scope of the STO to shares that have their main pool of liquidity inside the EU, Ostermann said.
""The question then is how exactly do you define those instruments,"" Ostermann added.
Stephane Boujnah, CEO of pan-European exchange Euronext, said the STO should be kept and limited to shares whose primary listing is in the bloc, with dual-listed shares exempt.
Last week Britain and the EU ended a fourth round of negotiations on a trade deal, but made little progress as fishing rights remain a stumbling block.
EU financial services access is being considered in separate assessments, though an actual decision could be determined by progress in the wider trade talks.

Markus Ferber, a German lawmaker who steered the EU's securities rules through the European Parliament, said he was disappointed by last week's talks as not a minute was devoted to financial market issues.

PARIS (Reuters) - France launched what it billed a 15-billion-euro ($17 billion) support plan for its aerospace industry on Tuesday, accelerating research on a green jetliner and warning 100,000 French jobs could be lost due to the coronavirus crisis.
The plans - which include 7 billion euros of aid already awarded to Air France (PA:AIRF) and bring forward some defence spending - involve a joint effort by government and industry to keep French jobs and prepare the next generation of civil jets.
The plans include a 1-billion-euro investment fund with an initial capital of 500 million euros, partly financed by planemakers Airbus (PA:AIR) and Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) and systems firm  Thales  (PA:TCFP).
""We must save our aerospace industry,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said, adding Europe - championed by Airbus - would not sacrifice its place on the world market to U.S giant Boeing (N:BA) or China's upcoming planemaking competitor COMAC.
The move comes after Boeing called for tens of billions in loan guarantees to help U.S. suppliers. Both Airbus and Boeing buy parts in each other's home markets and fragile suppliers are seen as an Achilles heel as manufacturers weather the crisis.
It was not immediately clear how much of the pledged public-private money was new, however. One person close to the talks acknowledged it involved a certain amount of ""packaging,"" though Le Maire insisted only the Air France aid was already planned.
In a sharp increase in funding for the CORAC research body, France said it would invest 1.5 billion euros over three years to support research into environmentally friendly technology.
The main goal of the investment would be a carbon-neutral successor to the A320, Europe's best-selling jet, with hydrogen as an energy source instead of today's oil-based gas turbines.
""Our target is to have a carbon-neutral airplane in 2035 instead of 2050, thanks especially to an (ultra-efficient) engine using hydrogen,"" Le Maire said.
EXPORT CREDIT HELP
Industry executives have expressed doubts that a radical switch away from classic jet engines would be ready for service by then, though engine makers say it is one path under study.
France said it had agreed with Britain, Germany and Italy a one-year moratorium on repayment by airlines of aircraft delivery loans backed by export credit agencies - a move worth 1.5 billion euros.
The system of export credits allows airlines with weak balance sheets to raise bank funds as though they had the same creditworthiness as governments of aircraft-producing nations.
It was heavily used on both sides of the Atlantic to smooth exports during the 2008-9 financial crisis but has had a limited role in tackling the coronavirus crisis so far because the problem is mainly one of collapsing worldwide demand.
France said it would also ask the European Commission to seek loan repayment concessions worth 2 billion euros in a multinational agreement on export credits overseen by the OECD.
The ""aerospace support plan"" also calls for some 600 million euros of military procurement deals to be accelerated. 
They include an order for three air tankers and eight Caracal helicopters from Airbus and a modified Beechcraft propeller plane for surveillance, originally ordered in 2016. France will also bring forward the purchase of naval surveillance drones.

In Toulouse, Europe's aerospace capital which has been reeling from the crisis, unions welcomed the plan and said a meeting expected to address restructuring with Airbus had been postponed from Thursday to the end of the month, potentially pushing it beyond French local elections.

The announcement by Wangfuijing Group (SS:600859) followed a notice last month by the state planner - the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) - that the country would relax control of the market and develop duty-free outlets in downtown areas to attract customers of imported goods.
The group, which operates more than 40 department stores including the Beijing Department Store, selling products such as apparels and cosmetics, said it would ""proactively push forward relevant work"" after approval from the Ministry of Finance, without disclosing details.
Compared to airport duty-free shops, downtown stores boast lower rent-to-sales ratio, better product variety, and flexibility in product pricing and promotions,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a report on Monday.
 Wangfujing  shares soared on the news, hitting the 10% daily price limit before the market closed.
China's own duty-free market only made up 9% of the global share, while one-third of global duty-free sales came from Chinese consumers in 2019, Morgan Stanley said.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Chanel, Revlon, L'Oreal pivoting away from talc in some products","By Martinne Geller and Lisa Girion
LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Chanel, Revlon and L'Oreal, three of the biggest brands in cosmetics, are quietly moving away from using talc in some products as U.S. cancer lawsuits and consumer concerns mount.
Luxury beauty company Chanel has removed talc from a loose face powder and dropped a talc body powder because of negative perceptions around the mineral, court documents reviewed by Reuters show. 
Revlon Inc removed talc from its body products, and L'Oreal SA is exploring alternatives for the mineral, those companies told Reuters. 
The moves come amid a reappraisal of talc in body powders and cosmetics by consumers, regulators and manufacturers. Talc - which is sometimes found in the same rock as asbestos, a potent carcinogen - is used in thousands of cosmetic and personal care products to absorb moisture, prevent caking and add softness.
Thousands of cancer lawsuits, some dating back to 2013, have been filed against body-powder market leader Johnson & Johnson. Allegations that asbestos contamination caused plaintiffs' cancers began in 2017. Other makers of talc powders also face suits, including Revlon, Chanel and Avon, securities filings and court records show.
Scrutiny of talc products intensified after a 2018 Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer reported that J&J knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc and powders. The company has disputed Reuters’ report and maintains its powders are safe and asbestos free. https://reut.rs/2BShyeh
J&J announced last month that it would stop selling talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, attributing the decision to declining sales and negative publicity.
In March, a Chanel representative disclosed in a court deposition that in 2017 the company had stopped making a talc-based body powder, scented with its iconic No. 5 fragrance that it had made since 1924. The deposition was taken in a 2018 case filed in a Los Angeles court. In it, a California woman alleges she got mesothelioma, in part from asbestos-tainted Chanel and J&J powders she used for decades.
Asbestos is the only well established cause of mesothelioma, an incurable rare cancer of the lining of the lungs and other organs.
Chanel representative Amy Wyatt said in the deposition that Chanel was sued for the first time over its talc powder in 2016 and she denied Chanel powders contained asbestos.
""We know that it was a safe product,"" Wyatt said in the deposition. But ""we determined from public perception to remove it from the market.""
Wyatt said Chanel had also removed talc from its loose face powder, but she was not sure when the new formulation would be on the market. She did not say what the talc was replaced with. 
Chanel told Reuters that it routinely updates its products ""to ensure we continue to meet our customers' changing needs and expectations,"" a spokeswoman said in an email.
Chanel, which continues to use talc in other products including pressed powder, blush and eye shadow, said all the talc it uses is ""selected according to strict purity criteria, fully complies with current global regulations, and is safe under standard conditions of cosmetic use.""
The privately held company did not respond to questions about the deposition or litigation.
A Revlon spokesman told Reuters the company removed talc from its body products. He declined to say when or why; he also declined to comment on litigation. 
L'Oreal said it is looking for a talc replacement but has not found anything that works as well.
""Well known partial alternatives exist, and we continue to explore and seriously consider performant alternatives,"" a spokeswoman told Reuters in an email. ""But none meet the same performance for our products."" 
L’Oreal - like other companies - requires its suppliers to certify annually that its talc is asbestos-free, and it does in-house testing, she said.
""We have not detected any trace of asbestos in any of our raw materials containing more than 20% talcum powder,"" L'Oreal's spokeswoman said. 
Other personal care companies have also stopped selling talc powder. Germany's Beiersdorf said it switched to corn starch in its Nivea baby powder in 2018. Bausch Health changed the formula of its Shower to Shower powder in 2018 ""to keep the product in line with market trends and customer preferences,"" and not because of safety concerns, a spokeswoman said.
Bausch, which last sold talc powder in February 2019, has been named in 165 lawsuits; 12 are pending, though Bausch is indemnified by J&J, the brand's prior owner, for any liability, securities filings show. 
Avon, which declined to comment, said in a securities filing that 128 lawsuits were pending against it over talc products. 
Sanofi (PA:SASY), maker of Gold Bond powder, told Reuters it stood by the safety of its talc powder and was ""vigorously"" contesting talc lawsuits against it. 
""Sanofi will continue to evaluate its product offerings in light of supply and consumer demand,"" a spokesman said. 
Globally, consumers are expected to purchase 139,350 tonnes of talc this year, down 0.6 percent from last year, according to Euromonitor International. 
Last year, during an analysis of 52 talc-containing cosmetic products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found asbestos in nine products, including three sold by tween retailer Claire's and one bottle of Johnson’s Baby Powder. All products were voluntarily recalled.
A spokeswoman said Claire's had stopped using talc, and replaced it with mica in most of its products. 

The FDA is analyzing 50 more samples this year and is considering establishing an asbestos testing standard. Canada's Health Ministry tentatively concluded in 2018 that talc itself may cause lung problems if inhaled, and ovarian cancer if used in the genital area. A final decision, expected next year, could lead to a ban or restriction on the use of talc in certain products in Canada.

400,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>","Bombardier, Once a Canadian Champion, Faces Ouster From Index","(Bloomberg) -- Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc. is facing the boot from Canada’s main index as it slides toward irrelevance for equity investors.
The manufacturer’s share price has been below C$1 since early March, potentially making it ineligible to stay in the S&P/TSX Composite Index and in turn the S&P/TSX 60 Index of large companies.
To be included in the composite, a company must have a minimum volume-weighted average price of C$1 over the previous three months, as well as over the last 10 trading days of the month prior to the index provider’s quarterly review, according to S&P Dow Jones index methodology. For Bombardier, that average price is now sitting at about 53 Canadian cents for the three months leading up to June.
A departure from the index could hurt demand for Bombardier’s shares as exchange-traded funds drop the stock. Other managers must also decide whether to keep the shares. “A portfolio manager must determine how closely they want to track the index and make a call on number of shares,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst George Ferguson.
Bombardier is aware of the guidelines for index inclusion but it won’t speculate on whether it will be removed in the upcoming review, Jessica McDonald, a company representative said.
S&P Dow Jones Indices releases its quarterly review within the first ten days of the rebalancing month, which would be June 12, spokesman Raymond McConville said.
Bombardier’s shares have continued their downward spiral despite a corporate revamp initiated by former chief executive officer Alain Bellemare. The stock has lost almost all of its value in 20 years.
The Montreal-based company was once seen as a Canadian champion of the industrial sector and a source of pride for Quebec. It made everything from snowmobiles to commercial aircraft but is now a shadow of its former self after ceding its marquee jet program, now known as the A220, to Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) and agreeing to sell its rail business to French train maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) SA in the face of more than $10 billion in debt.
The company’s market capitalization peaked at C$36.2 billion ($27 billion) in the summer of 2000. Today it’s C$1.4 billion.
Bellemare’s restructuring means Bombardier has made an all-in bet on the corporate jet market. That left the company, now led by Eric Martel, particularly exposed as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered travel globally and slashed corporate spending. Still, it’s possible that sales of private jets, which allow for physical distancing among passengers, may come back faster than commercial travel.
Last week, the company announced that it plans to eliminate 2,500 jobs at its aviation division following a slump in demand for business jets. In quarterly financial results released May 7, Bombardier said it’s bracing for a drop of at least 30% in sales of private jets as the crisis pummels demand this year.

The company's shares rose 12% in premarket trading, a day after Macy's said it had raised $4.5 billion to navigate through the fallout from the pandemic.
Macy's, like most other non-essential retailers in the United States, was forced to shut nearly all its 800 stores in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
While a full economic recovery is expected to be years away, retailers like  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc (N:AEO), Abercrombie & Fitch (N:ANF) and Macy's have indicated a recovery in sales, with a surge in online orders.
Macy's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said the company is now working to get the right merchandise in place for the crucial holiday season. 
Macy's said its preliminary sales fell to $3.02 billion in the quarter ended May 2, from $5.50 billion, in line with the company's prior forecast.
The company reported a preliminary adjusted net loss of $630 million, or $2.03 per share, in the same period, compared to a profit of $137 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Macy's has delayed reporting its full first-quarter results to July 1.

Six Saudi lenders had their stock recommendations cut to reduce from hold by  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), which said valuations have become too expensive given the negative risks to earnings.
The downgrades for Riyad Bank, Arab National Bank, Banque Saudi Fransi, Al Rajhi Bank, National Commercial Bank and Samba Financial Group mean all seven banks covered by the broker now have the same rating, with Alinma Bank being kept at reduce.
While measures such as regulatory easing and free government deposits are temporarily helping lenders’ credit quality and margins, they are only delaying credit risk events until mid-September, analyst Aybek Islamov wrote in a note.

The sector’s current valuation “leaves no room for negative earnings surprise at a time when these are highly likely,” Islamov said. He expects combined net income for the seven banks he covers to fall 17% this year and a further 3% in 2021.
If loan payment holidays for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) aren’t extended and the government cuts back on cheap liquidity injections, Banque Saudi Fransi and Riyad Bank stand out as having most potential earnings risk, according to Islamov. Al Rajhi Bank, on the other hand, would be the least affected due to having the lowest SME exposure.

The world's biggest steel producer took over the plant in the southern city of Taranto in 2018 but its rescue plans have triggered months of wrangling.
Ministers and labour officials met by video linkup on Tuesday to discuss the latest proposals, which had already prompted unions to call a 24-hour strike.
""Mittal on Friday sent us a new plan which in our opinion is unacceptable for two reasons: it questions job levels and challenges planned investment,"" Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said during a meeting, according to a source who attended the meeting.
After withdrawing its bid to walk away from the deal in exchange for an injection of state funding, ArcelorMittal has presented a plan with new proposals to cut jobs, provoking the ire of the government and the unions.
The company has confirmed sending the plan but has not provided any details. Italian media reported at the weekend that the plan included 5,000 job cuts.
Ilva employs more than 8,000 people and provides work for thousands more as suppliers or contractors.

Patuanelli said the government would try ""to reverse"" the plan's terms and safeguard all jobs at the plant, one of the few major industrial employers in Italy's economically struggling south.

SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong will lead a $5 billion rescue of Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293), which like other airlines has been hit by a global travel slump triggered by the coronavirus pandemic.
The government's involvement in the recapitalisation follows the double blows of Hong Kong's political unrest and the coronavirus outbreak, which Cathay said meant it was burning through about HK$3 billion ($387 million) a month in cash.
Around the world, states have been bailing out airlines and in some cases, such as Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), taking direct equity stakes to keep them flying.
""The alternative would have been a collapse of the company. Commercial debt markets are effectively closed to airlines today who do not have extensive government shareholder support,"" Cathay Chairman Patrick Healy told reporters on Tuesday.
Cathay has grounded most of its planes, flying only cargo and a skeleton passenger network to major destinations such as Beijing, Los Angeles, Sydney and Tokyo.
Like Singapore Airlines (SI:SIAL), which received an up to $10.1 billion rescue package led by state-investor Temasek, Cathay has no domestic market to cushion the international loss.
Finance Secretary Paul Chan said the investment in Cathay was to help protect Hong Kong's role as a leading international aviation hub while generating a reasonable financial return.
""It is not our intention to become a long term shareholder of Cathay Pacific,"" he told reporters. ""It is not our intention to interfere with the operation and management of Cathay."" 
Under the rescue plan, the Hong Kong government will be issued HK$19.5 billion of dividend-paying preference shares and HK$1.95 billion of warrants, giving it a 6% stake. 
It would also provide a HK$7.8 billion bridging loan and would have the right to two non-voting observers at board meetings. Chan said they would be seasoned business professionals.
The deal includes a HK$11.7 billion rights issue to existing shareholders, led by Swire Pacific Ltd (HK:0019) and  Air China  Ltd (HK:0753) (SS:601111), which had halted trading on Tuesday morning alongside Cathay, pending the announcement. 
Swire, which holds 45%, Air China which owns 30% and Qatar Airways with 10% plan to participate in the rights issue, Cathay said. Their holdings will fall to 42%, 28% and 9.4% due to the government stake.
POST-COVID TAKEOFF
BOCOM International analyst Luya You said the combined package would provide more than enough funding for Cathay.
""A recapitalisation plan of this size bodes well for Cathay's long-term future,"" she said. ""Big airlines with sufficient liquidity can actually gain significant market share immediately post-COVID.""
Cathay said a fall in passenger revenue to only 1% of the previous year's levels meant it had been losing cash at a rate of HK$2.5 billion to HK$3 billion per month since February.
It has furloughed some pilots at overseas bases and cut cabin crew roles in the United States and Canada, but has not announced large-scale permanent job losses.
The airline said it would put in place a further round of executive pay cuts and a second voluntary leave scheme.
Chairman Healy said ""tough decisions"" would be made in the fourth quarter after it reviewed all aspects of its business model, including its aircraft orders.

China's aviation regulator may make it difficult for it to merge regional arm Cathay Dragon into its main brand because of infractions during last year's pro-democracy protests, two sources told Reuters last month.

406,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",South African solar start-up SunExchange raises $3 million,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African blockchain-based renewable energy start-up SunExchange has raised $3 million from a company backed by one of the country's richest businessmen, the firm said on Tuesday.
SunExchange, which allows people to buy individual cells on solar projects and earn a rental income in cryptocurrency, has so far raised $4 million in Series A funding round that started in 2019.
Of this, $3 million came on Tuesday from billionaire Patrice Motsepe-backed  African Rainbow  Capital (ARC) (J:AILJ) via its stake in British-based private-equity firm ARCH Emerging Markets Partners, the company said.
The funding highlights increasing demand for solar power and growing investor appetite for unconventional business technologies in South Africa, even as the coronavirus is eliminating sources of finance for traditional businesses.
Mining baron Motsepe founded ARC in 2016 to bet on future technologies on the continent and has funded start-ups, such as online-only TymeBank and mobile internet provider Rain.
Cape Town-based SunExchange works on a crowd funding model, selling solar panels in a proposed project to raise money. The project will start only when all panels in it are sold.
It has solar power projects in 24 schools, shopping centres and business parks across South Africa.
It is banking on growing demand for off-grid electricity sources as state power firm Eskom, essentially bankrupt and reliant on creaking coal-fired stations, continues to inflict nation-wide electricity blackouts that began in 2008.
While investors have been bullish on South Africa's renewable energy plans with the government seeking to add 2.6 gigawatts (GW) of wind and solar capacity in 2022, they have been discouraged by red-tape and political wrangling.
Government research arm the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) expects installed capacity of small and medium solar PV to reach 2.33 GW by 2025 from less than 500 MW in 2017.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Prepping portfolios for next market storm? Not just gold and govvies,"By Saikat Chatterjee and Dhara Ranasinghe
LONDON (Reuters) - G7 government bonds? Check. Gold? Check. But that may not be enough as the coronavirus crisis accelerates a hunt for a wider pool of assets to better balance investment portfolios during stressful times. 
Corporate and Chinese government debt are among alternatives being explored by multi-asset portfolio managers with mandates to invest across sectors, currencies and countries.
It's been a moot point for years now whether U.S., Japanese and German bonds can adequately offset equity volatility. Given how relentlessly yields have fallen, many fear these bonds can no longer rally much when stocks fall - effectively losing the inverse correlation that made them a valuable defensive asset.
In fact Treasuries' hefty rally in the recent crisis showed their safe-haven credentials remain intact. And U.S., German and other developed government bonds will always have a role as portfolio ballast, backed by conviction that these debts will never face default and can easily be bought or sold.
But the crisis has shown that even the safest of assets can succumb to panic -- as global stocks tumbled during the volatile March 9-19 period, 10-year U.S. and German bond prices slid 9% and 7% respectively. 
Compare that to Bunds' 10% price rally during the worst of the 2011 euro debt crisis between end-May and early-August.
""We do have a sense that things are shifting,"" said Wouter Sturkenboom, who helps to formulate investment strategy for $350 billion in client assets at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Asset Management.
He has reallocated 7% of his equity portfolio towards U.S. corporate debt, inflation-linked bonds and cash, instead of government debt as he would have done earlier. 
""You can't just rely on (government bonds) in this environment, you need to go through the whole risk-control bucket,"" Sturkenboom added.
Similarly, Gavin Counsell, a multi-asset fund manager at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors, said he had roughly halved exposure to UK gilts since early March and favours precious metals.
The traditional multi-asset strategy - an equity-dominated portfolio alongside a big dollop of government bonds - appeared to function less well this year than during past crises.
During the 2008 global financial crisis for instance, a portfolio comprising equity and government bonds in a 60:40 ratio would have lost 2%. But in March-April this year, a similar portfolio lost 13%, according to investment advisory firm BCA Research. 
The reason bonds find it harder to move inversely to equities is that German and U.S. 10-year yields are 500 bps and 350 bps lower than they were on the eve of the 2008 crisis. 
""A stronger cross-asset correlation is the worst nightmare for any portfolio manager, and this has been a defining feature of this crisis, prompting the search for alternative assets,"" said Dhaval Joshi, chief European strategist at BCA. 
GRAPHIC: Correlations: Stocks, Bonds and Commodities - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzqbrrvw/correlations.JPG 
ALTERNATIVE?
Luckily for investors, the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to include company debt in its stimulus programme has sharply expanded the pool of potential 'safe' assets, adding $7 trillion in top-rated corporate bonds to the existing $20 trillion in government debt, Fed and IHS Markit data show.
In Europe too, $2.4 trillion of top-rated credit is eligible for European Central Bank purchases - on top of $8 trillion in government debt. 
Investors pumped a record $20.8 billion into investment grade corporate bonds in the week to June 3, according to BofA.
""Investment-grade paper ... is the new Treasuries as it has the backing of the Fed,"" said Jack McIntyre, fixed income portfolio manager at Brandywine Global.
""I would bypass some of these traditional safe haven markets to buy (IG) debt. Treasuries have an explicit guarantee from the government but IG credit has an implicit guarantee from the Fed."" 
Some are casting their net wider. 
Stuart Rumble, an investment director at Fidelity Investments is exploring Chinese government bonds as a diversification strategy - noting their lower correlation to global equities. 
They also pay a reasonable income - at 2.8% for 10-year paper they provide a 250-300 bps pickup over U.S. and European debt. 
GRAPHIC: Government bond yields during crises - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgpobzmbvd/Pasted%20image%201591275740724.png 
BlackRock's head of Asian Credit, Neeraj Seth, predicts a greater shift towards Chinese debt for portfolio diversification.
While emerging market bonds usually move in line with equities and other risk assets, Chinese government bonds increasingly go in the other direction - behaving like Treasuries or Bunds. 
In the first quarter of 2020, they gained nearly 5%, contrasting with a 15% drop in emerging market bonds. They have also outperformed U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds this year on a volatility-adjusted basis, Refinitiv data shows.
What about parking cash in money market funds? 
Investment advisers say that in countries such as Germany where one literally pays to hold cash, even conservative investors are increasingly willing to deploy the cash in equities and use option hedges to protect those positions.
""I had a call last week with a traditional German family office CEO who has never used options,"" said Christian Mueller-Glissmann, managing director of portfolio strategy and asset allocation at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
""And he essentially said it's time to start talking about put options.""

408,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>","Debt Shakeout Poised to Make FAANG, Giant Retailers Even Bigger","(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus recession is generating winners and losers in corporate America, with cash-rich behemoths set to get bigger while debt-heavy companies and the economy lag.
Slammed by the now-ending economic and social lockdown, a growing number of enterprises are filing for bankruptcy or closing up shop because they can’t pay the bills. Others are downsizing even as they pile up more I.O.U.s, adding to already record U.S. corporate debt.
The upheaval will act as a drag on growth as highly-leveraged companies are forced to divert resources from expanding their businesses to meeting creditor obligations.
“Higher debt burdens coming out of this are likely to slow recovery,” said former Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein.
The shakeout, though, will give cash-rich corporate titans an opening to grab market share and extend their dominance as the economy gradually reopens.
“The behemoths within the U.S. are going to have more market power,” Nobel Laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz said.
Potential winners include the liquidity-laden FAANG stocks beloved by investors: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-driven Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Big-box retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) also could come out ahead. So, too, might retail farm-store chain Tractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO).
Loser Lineup
The losers already are lining up at the bankruptcy courts. Among them are such American mainstays as J.C. Penney, J. Crew Group and Hertz.
Small and medium-size businesses that operate on thin profit margins are particularly vulnerable. While many have availed themselves of help via the government’s Paycheck Protection Program, they still face daunting prospects adjusting to a world where the virus remains a threat.
“Business failures are going to be in the hundreds of thousands,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics.
Winnowing out small firms would be a plus for larger, publicly traded companies, allowing them to grab a bigger piece of the profit pie. That may be one of the reasons why the stock market has performed so well relative to the dismal performance of the economy, said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
Unemployment unexpectedly fell last month to 13.3% from 14.7% in April but was still more than triple the level that prevailed prior to the pandemic. Among companies cutting jobs: airplane maker Boeing (NYSE:BA) and ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER).
Even before the crisis, many economists were becoming increasingly concerned about the rise of corporate leviathans that dominate industries and stifle competition.
It’s not only about tech, where Alphabet enjoys a more than 85% share of the global search-engine business. It’s also about the now-ailing airline industry (Delta, United, American), drugstore chains (CVS, Walgreens) and even the consumer product in short supply early in the crisis: toilet paper (Georgia-Pacific, Procter & Gamble,  Kimberly Clark  (NYSE:KMB)).
Overall, the market share held by the top players has increased in more than 75% of U.S. industries during the past two decades, according to a 2018 paper by Rice University Professor Gustavo Grullon and fellow researchers.
That’s being blamed for a variety of economic ills. In his 2019 book “The Great Reversal: How America Gave Up on Free Markets,” Thomas Philippon, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business, argues that a lack of competition leads to lower wages, less business investment and slower economic growth.
More concentration also means a bigger risk of supply-chain disruptions. That’s what happened in April, as the shutdown of some meatpacking plants hit by the coronavirus threatened the nation’s food supply, forcing President Donald Trump to invoke emergency powers to open them up.
Three companies --  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), JBS and Cargill -- control about two-thirds of America’s beef, and the bulk of it gets processed in a few dozen giant plants. So even closing a small number of facilities was enough to call the availability of supply into question.
“The existing levels of concentration there have now been proven dangerous,” said Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute think tank.
Financially Weak
Recessions historically lead to market consolidation as financially weaker firms are forced out of business. That could prove to be particularly true this time, given the unprecedented depth of the downturn and the large amount of debt many companies carried into it.
In May alone, some 28 businesses reporting at least $50 million in liabilities sought court protection from creditors. That brought the total for the first five months of the year to 99 for companies of this size -- the most for the period since 2009.
The toll might have been even greater but for the Fed’s Herculean effort to keep credit flowing to the economy via the capital markets. Through the first five months of 2020, companies issued more than $1.2 trillion in bonds, almost double the amount in the same period last year. From cruise-line operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK) to car-rental company  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group, many corporations were able to raise billions of dollars despite doubts about their long-term viability.
Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Ken Jacobs does see trouble ahead for cash-strapped businesses even as economies begin to reopen.
Second Wave
“The second wave likely starts sometime this summer for the companies that don’t have enough money to make it through,” said Jacobs, whose firm is working on some of the largest company restructurings in the world.
Edward Altman said he expects a record number of mega-bankruptcies this year, surpassing the previous high of 49 in 2009 for companies with liabilities greater than $1 billion. Defaults on junk bonds also will spike, the professor emeritus at NYU’S Stern School added.
“It’s not only the impact of Covid-19, which is of course the primary reason, but also the enormous amount of debt that had been building up in the economy prior to it,” said Altman, who developed a widely used method called the Altman-Z-Score for predicting business failures.
Widespread Carnage
The carnage is likely to be more widespread among small firms that lack access to the capital markets and depend on their own resources and the banks for financing. An April survey of small businesses by a group of economists including the University of Chicago’s Marianne Bertrand found the median respondent had more than $10,000 in monthly expenses and less than one month of cash on hand.
“Market concentration should increase significantly, which undermines workers’ ability to negotiate their wages, as big companies with access to capital markets take over from the small independent shops that are getting wiped out,” said Megan Greene, a senior fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School.
To protect themselves from takeovers, some corporations are adopting so-called poison pills, which generally allow investors to acquire additional shares if an unwanted suitor takes a significant stake in the company. That includes  Office Depot  (NASDAQ:ODP), which last month announced plans to lay off about 13,000 employees, and Oklahoma City driller Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), which Bloomberg reported is preparing a potential bankruptcy filing.
Long Odds
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Democratic lawmakers Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York also have weighed in, pushing a bill that would ban many corporate mergers while the coronavirus crisis persists. The proposal faces extremely long odds in the Republican-controlled Senate and with Trump.
Even before the crisis hit, big tech companies were facing increased scrutiny from antitrust regulators. While that could inhibit them from making overt moves toward consolidating their market power, it didn’t stop Amazon from recently looking into buying driverless-vehicle startup Zoox.
Not every economist is convinced that increased market concentration is all that bad. In a paper last year, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor David Autor and fellow researchers argued that so-called superstar firms are prospering because they’re more productive than their rivals.
No matter the reason though, the rich seem poised to get richer because of fallout from the pandemic. “There’s an accelerated shift in wealth and commerce going on from small businesses to big businesses,” former Deputy Labor Secretary Seth Harris said.

409,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>","Barclays Tells Rich Clients to Buy U.S. Stocks, Shun EM Equities","(Bloomberg) --
Emerging-market stocks may be recovering, but cash-rich investors would be better off avoiding the risks that still abound in developing nations.  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc is telling its high net-worth clients in emerging markets to invest in U.S. equities instead, despite the S&P 500’s breakneck rally.
Countries from India to Brazil and Russia have become the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, with their economies grinding to a halt and governments struggling to provide adequate stimulus. Their stretched budgets pale in comparison to the virtually “unlimited” support being provided by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. administration, Barclays Private Bank’s Salman Haider said.
“Compared to the U.S., emerging-market economies appear more vulnerable,” said Haider, the London-based managing director and head of global growth markets. “Their central banks have less room to maneuver, their governments may not be able to provide unlimited support and equity markets, given their sector mix, can be more challenged by an economic slowdown.”
Emerging markets’ inability to spend their way out of the crisis may put them at a growth disadvantage against the U.S., whose fiscal-support package accounts for at least 12% of gross domestic product. That may also halt a nascent rebound in developing-nation stocks, which have underperformed their American peers since the start of the trade war in 2018.
Even after a 33% bounce-back since late March when a panic selloff subsided, emerging-market stocks are still down 10% for the year, while the S&P 500 has surged 45% from the year’s lows. They now trade at a 36% discount to their U.S. peers, compared with 25% three months ago. Futures traders have pruned their net long positions to the lowest level since January 2016, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.
The caution reflects the deteriorating economic outlook for the developing world. Economists project no growth this year, with major economies including India, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and Russia slated for recessions.
Their response, so far, has been tepid. Even China, with $3 trillion reserves, announced stimulus measures amounting to a mere 3.5% of GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund. The ratio of fiscal packages came to 2.9% in Russia, 3% in South Africa and 1% of GDP in Mexico. In India, where a package worth 10% of GDP was announced, actual spending comes to just 1%.
“Many weaker countries are being uncomfortably exposed by the COVID-19 crisis as they seem to lack urgency in their policy response or simply don’t have the financial resources to withstand a larger period of containment,” Haider said.
Haider would invest around a third of a multiasset portfolio in U.S. stocks because, over the medium term, it offers “the most attractive risk-reward profile.”
He is pessimistic on emerging-market debt as well due to refinancing challenges and unsustainable deficits despite relatively high yields, and takes only “selective exposure” within emerging-market bonds at this stage. While a default or imminent restructuring does not seem likely in most countries, the debt securities of Sri Lanka, Honduras, Angola and Turkey are exposed to further volatility, said Haidar.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stock market bulls were forced to a halt on Tuesday and high-flying currencies like the euro and Australian dollar lost altitude, as a weeks-long risk rally ran into some turbulence.
It all seemed so sudden. Asian equities had scored their ninth day of gains after landmark highs by Wall Street on Monday, but Europe's big markets opened with a 0.5% to 1.5% lurch into the red. 
The euro fell 0.3% (EUR=) in only its second drop in 11 days, bonds were back in favour, while another barb from China in its spat with Canberra saw the Aussie dollar  drop a 1% having just set a 10-month top. 
""It fells like the FX market is looking at the equity market and thinking perhaps we should position for a correction,"" said Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) strategist Kit Juckes, referring to the recent surge in global equity markets. 
""It is going to depend on what the U.S. market does today as we have the FOMC (U.S. Federal Reserve policy announcement) to-morrow ...`but why wouldn't you buy some yen at this point'.""
The optimism for equity markets came last week after U.S. jobs data showed a surprise decline in the unemployment rate. Wall Street indices surged, with the Nasdaq (IXIC) closing at a record level on Monday. 
Global markets were mauled in March amid concern over both the short- and longer-term damage to the world economy from the coronavirus pandemic. But most indices are now back to pre-COVID-19 levels.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia shares outside of Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) advanced for a ninth straight session for its longest winning streak since early 2018. The 49-country world index is up nearly 45% from 4-year lows struck in mid-March. 
""The good news is that this shows central banks' effort to stabilise the market have worked,"" said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. 
Fears of renewed trade tensions between the United States and China and the second-round impact from higher unemployment and bankruptcies are hanging over the outlook, however.
In its latest Global Economic Prospects report on Monday, the World Bank said advanced economies are expected to shrink 7.0% in 2020, while emerging-market economies will contract 2.5%, their first slump since aggregate data became available in 1960.
On a per-capita gross domestic product basis, the global contraction will be the deepest since 1945-46, when World War Two spending dried up.
Tuesday's wobble in markets saw the safe-haven Japanese yen head up 0.4% to 107.93, while the U.S. dollar's gains elsewhere saw the greenback index make its best spurt since May 22. 

The mood had shifted in commodity markets, too. Oil prices (LCOc1) slipped over 1% in London after Brent had hit its highest in more than three months at $41 a barrel (CLc1). Gold flipped higher as industrial metals copper, nickel and aluminum all fell.

411,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Froth in Stocks Starts to Bubble Over After $21 Trillion Rebound,"(Bloomberg) -- As a sense of euphoria sweeps through global equity markets propelling stocks to regain $21 trillion in value from a March low, the asset class is looking increasingly frothy.
While stock luminaries who had advocated for a bull zone look like winners in hindsight, the debate goes on about whether the rally is a bear market bounce, doomed to end. While Asia still looks set to end the day with a gain, stocks in Europe have turned lower, poised for the worst performance in more than a week.
Global equities have climbed back to levels last seen in February, when the coronavirus began spreading rapidly outside of China. The 42% surge from a March low is the best advance over an equivalent time-frame since 2009 for the MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) ACWI Index that includes stocks in both the emerging and developed world. The gauge is now trading at 20 times next year’s profits, the most expensive since 2002.
“This rally is a function of government support being thrown behind the economy,” said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-asset quant solutions and client advisory for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management. “There are key risks that could lead to more volatility ahead over the short term, which is why we continue to hedge our portfolios on the downside while still looking for opportunities to add risk for the medium to long term.”
So far bulls are in charge. U.S. stocks just crossed an important psychological milestone of recouping this year’s losses. Asia’s equity benchmark is having its seventh straight day of gains, the longest streak in more than two years. And European shares are on course for the best monthly gain since 2009.
Factors including a wall of money from the guardians of global economies, the easing of lockdowns and the shockingly positive employment numbers in the U.S. are drawing more buyers to participate, picking up cheaper sectors and adding more fuel to the rally. Yet caution still abounds with some investors increasing hedges for potential volatility ahead.
“The risk of a correction will rise if investors continue to price in a rapid recovery, especially for sectors that are vulnerable to another wave of infections or an escalation of tensions between the U.S. and China,” said Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management.
In another sign that the rally is stretched, global share-price gains in the past month have purely come from multiple expansion as earnings forecasts have barely budged since May. Adding to that is the fact the MSCI world measure has been in overbought territory since the start of the month, with the relative strength gauge on the index reaching the highest since January, which is considered a bearish signal by some.
Meanwhile, speculative excess has surged to the highest in at least 20 years among U.S. options traders, a negative for stocks over the medium term, according to Sundial Capital Research Inc. And a time-honored strategy of hedging stocks with government bonds has become questionable now that bond yields have plummeted thanks to policy easing across the world.
“If everyone is holding stocks just to pass on to the next greater fool, and if the greatest fool is a central bank with infinite liquidity to buy them, then, yes, prices will keep going up,” according to a note from Rabobank on Tuesday.

412,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 03:58AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Lower; German Economic Weakness Weighs,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets pushed lower Tuesday, weighed by further signs of economic weakness in Germany, the region’s industrial powerhouse.
At 3:55 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.9% lower. France's CAC 40 fell 0.7%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.7%. 
German exports plunged at a record pace in April, down 31.1% from a year earlier, while imports fell the most since the financial crisis a decade ago.
The German economy is very reliant on trade, and while most companies have since returned to work, uncertainty about the evolution of the pandemic is still depressing orders. 
While the European economy is staggering, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde was forced Monday to defend the stimulus measures taken by the region’s central bank to combat the coronavirus pandemic from criticism by some lawmakers at a hearing in the European Parliament.
This comes after Germany's Constitutional Court gave the ECB three months to justify the massive purchases of government bonds or lose the German Bundesbank as the main buyer in its key debt-buying scheme.
In corporate news,  BP  (LON:BP) dropped 1.1% after the oil major announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs following a global slump in demand for crude.
The oil giant had paused redundancies during the peak of the pandemic but told staff on Monday that around 15% will leave by the end of the year.
 British American Tobacco  (LON:BATS) dropped 2.3% after downgrading its revenue growth expectations for the full year despite saying it had been performing well in the first half of the year amid the Covid-19 outbreak.
Oil prices sold off Tuesday, continuing Monday’s strong selloff in what looks an overdue correction after recent hefty gains.
Crude has risen strongly from the lows in April--WTI has jumped 300% and Brent 170%--on a combination of record oil production cuts instigated by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, and signs of increased demand as the global economy restarted. 
At 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.1% lower at $37.77 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.8% to $40.47.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,708.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1266, down 0.2%."

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) fell 0.3% by 0729 GMT, with eurozone banks (SX7E) down 4.3% after a six-day run of gains.
Dragging London's FTSE 100 (FTSE) lower, British American Tobacco (L:BATS) fell 2.8% as it cut its annual adjusted profit and revenue forecasts, citing the impact of prolonged lockdowns in South Africa and Mexico.
The European benchmark is still hovering near its early March highs, just 14% below its record high, while Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq (IXIC) closed at an all-time high on Monday, confirming a return to bull market. 

Healthcare stocks (SXDP), technology (SX8P) and food and beverage (SX3P) supported markets, rising between 0.6% and 1.6%.

Greek banks have been making headway in their bid to sell, write off or restructure billions of euros of soured loans accumulated during the last financial crisis.
The high level of non-performing exposures (NPEs) - about 40% of their loanbooks in March - constrains their ability to finance the country's economic recovery.
Fokion Karavias said Eurobank's NPE ratio at 15.6% with 60% coverage ""stands out in the Greek market"". The ratio stood at 31.1% in September last year, while those of close peers National Bank and Alpha Bank were at 30.9% and 30% respectively.
""We are now able to zero in on financing the real economy,"" he said. ""We have already expanded our loan book to businesses by more than 1.0 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in 2020. We expect a total increase of above 2.0 billion for the full year."" 
Last week Eurobank concluded the sale of an 80% stake in its loan servicing unit FPS to doValue (MI:DOVA), along with a chunk of mezzanine and junior notes of a 7.5 billion NPE securitisation dubbed project Cairo.
With the deal, Verona-based doValue boosted its loans portfolio in Greece to 28 billion euros.
The CEO expects Greece's economy to grow above expectations in 2021, covering most or even all of the ground lost in the current year when the central bank, under its baseline scenario, sees it contracting by around 6%. 
""Greece's participation, for the first time, in the European Central Bank's enhanced quantitative easing programme and upcoming EU support makes me optimistic,"" Karavias said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open mixed Tuesday, with concerns about the German central bank’s participation in the ECB’s stimulus package weighing, despite a strong close on Wall Street.
At 2:00 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were up 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.2%.

This comes after Germany's Constitutional Court gave the ECB three months to justify the massive purchases of government bonds or lose the German Bundesbank as the main buyer in its key debt-buying scheme.
“She emphasised that this decision was not addressed to the ECB, leaving this a domestic German issue,” said analysts at Danske Bank, in a research note. “Unless solved, the Bundesbank should not be able to participate in the PSPP programme from 5 August.”

Investing.com – Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) will receive a HK$30 billion ($3.87 billion) rescue package from the Hong Kong government as part of a $40 billion capital restructuring exercise.
The package will see the government take an undisclosed stake in the embattled airline, which includes two ""observer"" boardroom seats. These seats, although they do not come with voting rights, will allow the government to have its say on major decisions affecting public interest.
The airline will also receive a loan for an unspecified amount to be paid back later.
Airlines have been hit hard by the COVID-19 virus, with the resultant travel restrictions shrinking traveler numbers. Most have been forced to seek government bailouts or strengthen their cash position.
Shares of Cathay shareholders Swire Pacific (OTC:SWRAY) and Air China (OTC:AIRYY) were also halted from 9AM in Hong Kong. Swire has a 45% stake in the airline, while Air China has an almost-30% share.

Vroom priced its IPO at $22, above the initially marketed range of $18 to $20, valuing the company, which is backed by funds such as T Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) Associates and L Catterton, at $2.48 billion. The company sold 21.25 million shares compared with the earlier plan of 18.8 million shares.
Recent recovery in the U.S. stock markets has led to a flurry of IPO-hopefuls entering the race. Royalty Pharma, which buys biopharmaceutical royalties, unveiled plans on Monday to raise up to $1.96 billion in an IPO.
Vroom, which had filed for an IPO last month, reported a more than twofold rise in sales at its e-commerce business in the first quarter of 2020 as the virus outbreak and stay-at-home orders stoked a surge in online shopping.
The company, which use digital tools to close deals and home delivers vehicles to customers, said revenue for the first quarter ended March 31 jumped 60% from a year earlier, and net loss attributable to Vroom's common stockholders narrowed to nearly $41.1 million from $45.1 million.

BEIJING (Reuters) - In May 2019, China's central bank announced a shock takeover of a lender, its first such move in 20 years, citing ""serious credit risks"". Creditors in small Baoshang Bank were to take a hit, assets would be sold and an example set for governance.
But a year on, regulatory and banking sources say, the rescue of a bank that had expanded rapidly, well beyond its own city base, has veered off its planned trajectory amid infighting between regulators, limited help from big state banks and a larger-than-expected role for financially stretched local government. 
In future, such deals are likely to see a mix of support and mergers with bigger institutions, one senior regulator said, asking not to be named due to sensitivity of the matter. The Baoshang takeover has already been followed by bank rescues where authorities absorbed risk without creditors taking a hit. 
As the world's No. 2 economy takes the strain of slowing growth and fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, small lenders like Baoshang will be central to market stability - more than 4,500 in number, they account for about a quarter of the nearly 300 trillion yuan ($42 trillion) assets held by Chinese banks.
""In the next 1-2 years ... forced lending to support the economy will come back to haunt lenders in significantly increased non-performing loans,"" said Rory Green, a China economist at TS Lombard. 
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the country's principal banking regulator, didn't respond to requests for comment.
In a statement to Reuters, the People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) (PBOC), the central bank, said, ""The consistent policy of regulatory authorities (is) ... to guide small and medium-sized banks to return to their original market and focus on their main businesses."" 
'OUT OF THE BLUE'
Last month, PBOC extended its control of Baoshang for six months, citing delays caused by the impact of coronavirus. 
But officials had encountered difficulties well before that, people familiar with the matter said. Sources interviewed by Reuters for this article declined to be identified citing the sensitivity of the matter.
Founded in 1998, Baoshang blossomed under the control of billionaire Xiao Jianhua's investment firm Tomorrow Holdings. But problems began after Xiao fell foul of a regulatory crackdown https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tomorrow-sales-exclusive/exclusive-missing-chinese-tycoons-tomorrow-holdings-puts-investments-up-for-sale-sources-idUSKBN19Q18J on financial conglomerates in 2017.
When the PBOC launched its move, it said Baoshang had been used by Tomorrow as an ""ATM"" with ""serious credit risks"", without disclosing details. The rescue sent borrowing costs rocketing overnight, forcing the PBOC to inject up to 200 billion yuan in liquidity, private estimates showed.
The PBOC plan was straightforward on paper: creditors would absorb losses - a rarity in China - and the bank would be reduced in size, supported by the biggest state-backed lenders.
The move surprised not just financial markets, but also the CBIRC, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. One of them said it came ""totally out of the blue"" for the watchdog.
CBIRC had in fact been quietly meeting with Baoshang since Xiao's 2017 downfall, offering monthly guidance on how to stabilise liquidity, the two sources said, with no intention of imposing inter-bank defaults.
BIG CITY LICENCES
Still, China's big five banks showed little interest when approached by the PBOC to take a majority stake with concerns over asset quality, said the two sources.
China Construction Bank (CCB) (HK:0939), appointed as Baoshang's custodian bank, holds a mere 5% stake.
The PBOC then turned to Baoshang's creditors. Eventually it sold the bank's four licences in big cities outside Inner Mongolia, including Beijing, for an estimated 106.5 billion yuan to Anhui province's  Huishang Bank  (HK:3698), based more than 1,000 kilometres to the south.
The CBIRC didn't agree with the deal, the two sources said, partly because it went against efforts it had sought to enforce from early 2018 to limit smaller city banks to their home market.
""It's unfair when you ban one bank from expansion while granting another banking licences beyond its home region,"" one source said.
Like CCB, Huishang did not respond to requests for comment.
'NORMAL BUSINESS' - PBOC
In its statement to Reuters, the PBOC said, ""Huishang Bank's acquisition of four branches outside Inner Mongolia ... is normal business behaviour and is in line with the current regulatory policy.""
""Third-party intermediaries and relevant departments have made a full assessment of Huishang Bank's ability to undertake and dispose of the acquisition,"" it said. 
Since Baoshang, other banks have been rescued in a much less robust style: Bank of Jinzhou (HK:0416), in northern Liaoning province, and Hengfeng Bank, in eastern Shandong province, were rescued by PBOC and local governments last year, without creditors shouldering losses. 
Bank of Jinzhou and Hengfeng Bank didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Back in Inner Mongolia, local authorities already facing a plunge in fiscal revenues after the coronavirus epidemic and local state enterprises have been left with majority control of what's left of Baoshang, now known as Mengshang Bank. 
Neither the authorities nor Mengshang responded to requests for comment.

(Reuters) - Creditors of Cirque du Soleil Entertainment Group led by private equity firm Catalyst Capital Group Inc made an offer on Monday to take control of the circus company through a debt restructuring in Canada, a person familiar with the matter said.
The group of creditors is proposing to invest $300 million in Montreal-based Cirque and reduce its $1.2 billion debt pile by $900 million, the person said. The creditor group, which also includes asset managers BlueMountain Capital and Sound Point Capital Management LP and others, holds nearly three-quarters of Cirque du Soleil's debt, the person said. 
Cirque started exploring debt restructuring options, including a possible bankruptcy in March, after it was forced to cancel shows because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The company, famous for its shows in Las Vegas, had to temporarily lay off most of its staff after nationwide coronavirus shutdowns nixed its performances.
Bids for Cirque du Soleil were due on Monday, people familiar with the matter said. 
Any deal would likely be completed through a court restructuring in Canada, the sources said. The timing of any court restructuring remains in flux as Cirque du Soleil prepares to review bids, one of the sources said. 
It is unclear if the creditor group's bid will be accepted. But as Cirque du Soleil's creditors, the group will have a say over the path of the company's restructuring, the source added.
The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. Dan Gagnier, a spokesman for Catalyst, as well as Cirque du Soleil and BlueMountain Capital declined to comment, while Sound Point did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Officials from Canada's Quebec province have also offered $200 million in aid to Cirque du Soleil, which started as a ragtag group of street performers in Canada. 
Private equity firm TPG acquired a majority stake of Cirque du Soleil in 2015 in a $1.5 billion deal.

The New York Post first reported on the offer on Monday.

424,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 08:35PM ET</span>",South Korean court denies arrest warrant request for Samsung heir,"By Heekyong Yang and Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Tuesday denied an arrest warrant request for Samsung (KS:005930) Group heir Jay Y. Lee after prosecutors accused him of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.
The ruling provided temporary relief for the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF). But he may face further pressure from the case at a time when the world's top maker of smartphones and memory chips contends with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand. 
Shares in Samsung Group affiliates rose broadly in early Tuesday trade, with Samsung Electronics rising 2%, Samsung BioLogics up 2.4%, and Samsung C&T climbing 2.2% compared to a 1.2% rise in the benchmark KOSPI. 
Prosecutors last week asked the court to issue an arrest warrant for the 51-year-old Lee, as part of a probe into alleged accounting fraud involving a Samsung drugs affiliate and a 2015 merger of two other affiliates.
They said the fraudulent accounting, and alleged stock manipulation, helped facilitate Lee's plan to assume greater control of the group. 
""It appears that prosecutors have secured considerable amount of evidence through their investigation, but they fell short of explaining the validity to detain Lee,"" the Seoul Central District Court said in a statement. 
""Considering the significance of the case, it is appropriate to determine whether the suspects are responsible and the degree (of their involvement) through sufficient trials and debates,"" the court said. 
Prosecutors called the decision regrettable, saying their investigation would proceed nonetheless. They may decide to reapply for the arrest warrant request for Lee, after further investigation, or bring Lee to trial without arrest.
Lee's attorneys said in a statement they hoped the case would get a thorough review from an outside panel that would decide whether or not an indictment of Lee was justified.
The allegations against Lee center on illegal transactions and stock manipulation that furthered the $8 billion merger of affiliates Samsung C&T Corp and Cheil Industries in 2015, according to prosecutors. 
The merger was seen as key to Lee increasing control of the sprawling group but critics say it rode roughshod over the interests of minority investors. 
Prosecutors also allege he had a role in inflating the value of Samsung Biologics Co Ltd, which counted Cheil Industries as a major shareholder. 
Samsung has denied the allegations. 
Lee was previously jailed for about a year, until his release in February 2018, for his role in a bribery scandal. He was accused of giving horses to the daughter of a confidante of former President Park Geun-hye to win government support for the merger of the two affiliates.

South Korea’s Supreme Court has since overturned an appeals court decision to suspend Lee's sentence in that case, but a court ruling over whether he should serve further jail time is still pending.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 07:30PM ET</span>","Ackman says hedge fund up 27% year to date, dumped Berkshire","BOSTON (Reuters) - William Ackman's hedge fund is boasting double-digit gains at a time many portfolios have sunk along with the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, after the billionaire investor plowed cash into a number of companies he already owned and dumped Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway among other stocks.
The public and private funds at Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management have gained between 22% and 27% this year, handily beating both the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the average hedge fund which are each off 7% since January, Ackman said.
Ackman, who began worrying about the health and market impact of the pandemic months ago, famously hedged his portfolio with a $27 million bet that turned into a $2.7 billion windfall that he reinvested in the stock market in late March, buying bigger stakes in companies he was already betting on.
""We like what we own and we still think these stocks are cheap,"" Ackman told investors on a conference call on Wednesday, adding that his portfolio contains companies whose businesses can withstand unpredictable events with severe consequences.
Positions in Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa), Blackstone Group (N:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (N:PK) were liquidated because the cash could be used more efficiently elsewhere, he said.
Money was used to buy more stock in Agilent Technologies (N:A), Starbucks (O:SBUX), Restaurant Brands International (TO:QSR), Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (N:HLT), he said, arguing these large companies have best-in-class technology to weather the pandemic.
This year's gains come on the heels of last year's 58.1% return, the single best year since Pershing Square's founding in 2004, and signal that Ackman is still having success with his back-to-basics strategy where in 2018, he took back control of making investments instead of being the firm's chief marketer.
Ackman was early in closing down his Manhattan office and sending staff to work from home. When millions of other Americans were told to stay away from the office, Ackman pounced on the beaten-down stock of Lowe's, arguing that the time for long-delayed home improvement projects is now.
""We bought Lowe's at $84 a share and it was the bargain of a lifetime,"" he said with the stock now at $127.62.

426,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 07:00PM ET</span>",Shale Pioneer Chesapeake Plans Bankruptcy With Options Dwindling,"(Bloomberg) -- Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK). is preparing a potential bankruptcy filing that could hand control of one of the leading lights of the U.S. shale revolution to senior lenders, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The dwindling options for a powerhouse that once rivaled  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). for title of king of American natural gas comes after Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler’s 7-year effort to untangle the financial and legal legacies of Chesapeake’s late founder, Aubrey McClendon.
Lawler’s denouement, in turn, would signal the deep peril facing a shale industry largely built according to McClendon’s blueprint for Chesapeake: amassing incredible debts to pursue aggressive drilling programs that ultimately unearthed too little treasure to reward investors.
Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, declined to comment. The talks with lenders come almost seven years to the date that Lawler assumed the helm at the Oklahoma City-based company at the behest of Carl Icahn and O. Mason  Hawkins  (NASDAQ:HWKN), at the time two of the driller’s biggest investors.
Chesapeake is negotiating a restructuring support agreement that could see holders of its so-called FILO term loan take a majority of the equity in bankruptcy, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential matters. The support agreement remains fluid and the terms could change, the people said.
Chesapeake, which owes about $9 billion, is debating whether to skip interest payments due on June 15 and invoke a grace period while it talks with creditors, the people said. No final decision has been made. The company has also begun soliciting lenders to provide debtor-in-possession financing to fund its operations during bankruptcy, according to one of the people.
Ripple Effects
A bankruptcy filing by Chesapeake would reverberate well beyond its investors and employees because it will put millions of dollars in pipeline, fracking and other contracts at risk.
The stock, whose shrunken price was boosted by a 1-for-200 reverse stock split earlier this year, more than tripled at one point Monday to $84.75, then plunged to $52.05 after Bloomberg reported the potential Chapter 11 filing. A bankruptcy typically wipes out existing shareholders.
Chesapeake, the brainchild of McClendon and co-founder Tom Ward, was one of the first to aggressively combine breakthroughs in horizontal drilling and high-intensity hydraulic fracturing to shale rock long ignored by geologists looking for gas or oil.
That gamble provided trailblazers like Chesapeake, Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) Inc. and EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG). a head start over industry titans like Exxon and  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX) in dominating the burgeoning shale sector. Years later, companies like Exxon would pay dearly to gain footholds in shale.
Lawler’s efforts to rescue Chesapeake have included across-the-board belt-tightening at the company’s once-lavish corporate headquarters, along with tens of thousands of job cuts. A years-long campaign to transform the gas giant into an oil company never gained traction.
Pre-Covid
The driller recorded $8.5 billion in impairments for the first three months of the year as the value of its fields, a sand mine and other assets plunged along with commodity prices.
Chesapeake was already in a precarious position before the Covid-19 outbreak sent crude demand plummeting. At its height more than a decade ago, the producer was a $37.5 billion juggernaut commanded by McClendon, an outspoken advocate for the gas industry. But Chesapeake’s success at extracting the fuel from deeply buried rock contributed to a massive gas glut.
Kirkland & Ellis and Rothschild & Co. are advising Chesapeake, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The FILO lenders are organized with Davis Polk & Wardwell and Perella Weinberg Partners LP, the people said. Franklin Resources Inc (NYSE:BEN). is organized with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP, according to one of the people.
Representatives for Rothschild, Perella Weinberg and Franklin declined to comment, while representatives for Kirkland & Ellis, Davis Polk, and Akin Gump didn’t immediately comment.

427,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Vietnam’s Richest Man Has a Plan to Save the Virus-Stricken World,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic largely leapfrogged Vietnam—the country has reported just 332 cases and no deaths—but from his sprawling headquarters in Hanoi, billionaire Pham Nhat Vuong could see a need beyond the border. In April, the country’s richest man surveyed his cradle-to-grave conglomerate and made a decision. He was getting into ventilators.
In the worst cases of Covid-19, the virus attacks the lungs, making it harder to get oxygen to the bloodstream. A ventilator can be the difference between life and death, and there aren’t enough of them. By one estimate, the world’s hospitals could use another 800,000.
The shortage is most acute in the developing world—South Sudan, for example, has just four ventilators for a population of 12 million—but the world’s richest country is short, too. After reports that some hard-hit New York City hospitals had jury-rigged ventilators to serve two patients at the same time, President Donald Trump compelled automakers and other U.S. companies to start making the devices. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co. teamed up to deliver 50,000 ventilators by July 13 in a $336 million government contract.
Vuong believes his company, Vingroup JSC, can do it faster and for less money. Using an open-source design from device maker  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) Plc, Vingroup submitted a working ventilator for regulator approval in mid-April. While the company waits for Vietnam’s regulators to give the go-ahead, ventilators are rolling off the assembly line.
Vingroup’s ventilators cost around $7,000 in Vietnam, 30% less than Medtronic’s own model. The company also says it could produce as many as 55,000 a month as soon as the government approves them and plans to export them wherever there’s demand. Vingroup says it’ll donate several thousand to Ukraine and Russia, where Vuong has long-standing business ties.
“For the time being, we will focus on producing lots of ventilators—and doing it really well,” said the 51-year-old Vuong, who shared his plans over the course of a few months in a rare interview at Vingroup’s Hanoi headquarters and in a series of emails. “We want to join hands with the Vietnamese government to solve a part of the pandemic problem.”
While Vingroup runs a handful of hospitals and clinics, being a medical device manufacturer hadn’t been on the agenda. But Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine, is known for an ambition that dovetails Vietnam’s own. So when the country pushed domestic manufacturers to make more sophisticated products, Vingroup started making cars and smartphones. 
Now, as the government gives away cases of made-in-Vietnam face masks to virus-hit countries overseas, Vuong is making ventilators part of an even more ambitious global campaign: selling Vietnamese cars to the world. In December, he announced that VinFast, the conglomerate’s automotive group, would develop an electric vehicle and export it to the U.S. by 2021. Vuong is pledging $2 billion of his own fortune to make the improbable feat happen.
Whether Americans would consider a Vietnamese car remains an open question. Ventilators, on the other hand, are a product the virus-stricken world can’t turn down. “The lesson we learn from a crisis is that there will always be lots of opportunities,” said Vuong. “We have to make the right choices and act fast.”
Over the past two decades, Vietnam has become one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. Average annual incomes have grown more than sixfold, and even pre-pandemic, Vuong fixated on building a company fast enough to keep up with the country’s growing middle class. Today the Vingroup umbrella covers dozens of businesses that touch Vietnamese from childhood through senescence.
A baby can be born in a Vinmec hospital, grow up in a Vinhome, attend a Vinschool and go on to VinUniversity. A family might drive a VinFast car through a community designed by Vingroup’s master planners en route to a vacation at a Vinpearl resort. In their everyday lives, they can talk on VinSmart phones and shop for international brands at Vincom malls.
For Vietnam’s leaders, Vuong and Vingroup are a testament to the country’s progression from a socialist economy to a market-oriented one. The government has applauded Vingroup’s growth and success as part of Vietnam’s modernization. When VinFast’s first car rolled off the assembly line, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc declared it “a great day for Vietnam.”
What Vuong and Vietnam’s top leaders crave is international recognition, particularly in the U.S., the country’s onetime enemy and the world’s biggest economy. Many Americans, Vuong acknowledges, still see Vietnam as a “poor, backward country where it’s impossible to have modern and high-tech products.” The successful global introduction of a Vingroup product—whether it’s a car or a ventilator—could change the way the world sees Vietnam.
“We want the company to tackle things that people think are relatively difficult, things that Vietnamese private enterprises have not done successfully,” he said. “It’s our mission and responsibility to develop a Vietnamese brand with a world-class reputation.”
Ventilators may prove a strategic introduction to the global market. If Vingroup can pull off production at the scale Vuong’s anticipating, it will be addressing a worldwide shortage, leveraging on Medtronic’s brand as a well-established medical device maker. And if the ventilators work the way they’re supposed to, Vingroup will have proven its ability to deliver a complicated, reliable, life-saving device—not a bad bona fide for an aspiring carmaker.
The company configured its first ventilator assembly line in less than a month, customizing three rows of conveyor belts in its seven-month-old smartphone factory. Engineers from the company’s VinFast car unit worked on the design of the device, and representatives from Medtronic are advising workers who were making smartphones and TV panels a few weeks ago.
“There are very few companies in the world like it,” said Mark Mobius, founder of Mobius Capital Partners LLP. He’s been investing in Vietnam for the past decade and has private equity investments in the nation. “The ambition is astounding. It would be a huge win—to make Vietnam a global player.”
Vuong says his plans for global expansion have only been emboldened by current events. Vingroup still anticipates hiring a few hundred engineers to expand the research and design center in Australia that will develop VinFast’s next car models and EVs. The company is reportedly interested in acquiring some assets of the soon-to-be-defunct Australian automaker Holden.
“He seems to be zigging when other EV startups are zagging,” said Michael Dunne, chief executive officer of automotive consultant ZoZo Go, which focuses on the Asian market. “He has sky-high ambitions. But then there are reality checks.”
Vuong has echoes of another automotive titan, Dunne says: Li Shu Fu, head of China's biggest private carmaker Geely Automotive Holdings Ltd. Best known for acquiring Volvo from Ford in 2010, Li has become the dominant force in China’s car market. And, like Vuong, he’s declared his American ambitions. In 2006, he announced plans for Geely to export cars to the U.S. More than a decade later, neither Geely nor any other Chinese car brand has done so. 
Vuong has steered the company through rough times before. In 2011, as Vietnam’s inflation spiked to a region high of 23% and the real estate market tanked, the company’s real estate unit debuted its first master-planned community, featuring luxury villas along a man-made canal. The company’s consolidated net income fell 64% that year. It merged its real estate and tourism units to form Vingroup.
The merger worked. Net revenue reached a record in 2012 and profits rebounded.  Since then, revenue has grown seventeen-fold, hitting 130.8 trillion dong ($5.6 billion) in 2019. Last year, the company restructured, abandoning early plans for an airline and selling off most of its grocery stores unit as well as its agriculture business.
“The ongoing businesses now are the ones with the biggest potential. We won’t change our business strategy,” said Vuong. “If the global recession is severe, we can adjust some of our short-term plans.”
Vuong has the confidence of someone who’s grown very rich reading and shaping consumer desires. In his earliest success, he sold Vietnamese instant soup noodles in Ukraine, where he settled after a college scholarship took him to Moscow. To convince a population raised on borscht and dumplings to love just-add-water soup, he hit the malls, did cooking demonstrations and gave away hundreds of free samples.
“At the end of the day, we convinced the Ukrainian consumer,” said Vuong. The business became a household staple in the Eastern European state, and Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) eventually acquired it for an estimated $150 million.
In 2000, Vuong returned to Vietnam with his noodle profits and found nothing but opportunity. “The infrastructure was too outdated compared to the world. Hanoi only had a few high-rise buildings and five-star hotels,” he said. “I had the money. If I invested and couldn’t earn anything back, my thought was, at least the city would have big, nice buildings.”
Within three years, he opened Vietnam’s first upscale hotel, the Vinpearl Resort & Spa on Hon Tre Island, connected by a two-mile gondola to the seaside city of Nha Trang. The grounds include Vietnam’s first water park and an 18-hole golf course.
He started a real estate company — later merged to become Vingroup — and began building modern condominiums with supermarkets, schools and malls. Last year, the residential real estate arm sold 10,000 apartments in 17 days at its Vinhomes Grand Park, a canyon of riverside residential towers in the commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City. The development encircles Landmark 81, Vietnam’s tallest skyscraper, also a Vingroup property.
Vuong announced his plans to build and sell cars in September, 2017. Nine months later, he debuted his plans for a smartphone unit, VinSmart. The breadth of ambition and speed of execution has staggered observers and, often, partners.
“If you work with them, it’s on their terms,” says Stephen Wyatt, Vietnam country head of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., which worked on the valuation for Vinhomes ahead of its 2018 initial public offering. “It needs to be turned around in a very short space of time, whatever the scope may be. I have had calls in the middle of the night from them if they are waiting for a report or if something hasn’t been delivered.”
VinFast introduced three new combustion vehicles last year and says it received more than 17,000 orders. In November, it plans to debut its first electric vehicle, a crossover SUV, at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. The batteries, built with cells from LG Chem, give the car a 500 kilometer (310 mile) range on a single charge, about 15% less than Tesla’s Model S. Meanwhile, local media have spotted another VinFast EV prototype, a two-door coupe, on the streets of Hanoi. The company says it plans to test them widely this winter and start selling them by the summer.
Vingroup’s plan to export electric vehicles to the U.S. in 2021 or 2022 is “not realistic,” said Dunne. U.S. safety, environmental and regulatory approvals typically take at least two to three years, and it’s not clear whether Vingroup’s begun the process. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on whether the company has filed any of the necessary paperwork.
There are more questions, all with potentially expensive answers. Tesla Inc., which leads the American pack of electric carmakers, has yet to make an annual net profit. A slew of Chinese EV startups were “also caught in the same circumstances,” said Dunne. “You just don’t step into the U.S. market and do it quickly.”
Global ratings agencies have their own doubts. Last fall, both S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings changed their outlook on Vingroup to negative, citing concerns that the conglomerate relies on its cash-rich property unit—which makes up the bulk of Vingroup’s profit—to fund its new ventures. The company carried 291 trillion dong ($12.5 billion) in debt in the first quarter, up 37% from a year ago.
Others ask whether Vingroup may grow too big to fail, so entrenched in Vietnam’s economy that the government and banking institutions would have to bail it out to prevent a collapse. Vingroup units have a combined market value of about $28 billion, or about 16% of the total value of the country’s publicly traded companies. As the company’s sales dropped by about one-third through the first quarter of 2020, they dragged both Vingroup shares and the broader market down too.
“There’s a moral hazard if they believe they make such a key contribution that they take on more and more risks, thinking the government will help them out,” said Le Hong Hiep, an expert on Vietnam’s economy and politics at think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. “That’s a common problem with other national champions in Asia. If Vingroup collapses, it will be the government and the whole country that will also pay a heavy price.”
Vuong doesn’t deny the risk, saying “any company can collapse.’’ He says the conglomerate has run contingency scenarios in case of a real estate meltdown like the one in 2009 and continues to plan for divestments across the group. So far, the property market is expected to grow slightly this year, with Vingroup also now developing industrial parks that are expected to be in demand as manufacturers move into Vietnam from China.
And to those who doubt his EV ambitions, Vuong pointed out that VinFast turned a swamp into a state-of-the-art automotive factory, complete with fully-automated robotic production lines, and delivered a car in 21 months—another feat few thought was attainable until it happened.
For now, the phone factory will redeploy some of the same metals, plastics and silicon semiconductors to make ventilators. About 70% of the materials are sourced locally, Vingroup says, and it can tap an already vast supply chain. Just 85 workers are producing an initial 160 ventilators a day as the company awaits final approval from the government to ramp up manufacturing.
Vingroup’s two ventilator models have met initial technical standards, and clinical trials are under way, according to Nguyen Minh Tuan, who heads the department at the health ministry that’s regulating the ventilators. He said Vingroup should get approval to mass produce the ventilators once the results of the clinical trials come in this month.
Vuong says the current price of the ventilators is less than what it costs to make them. “The purpose of ventilator production is completely about contributing to society at this critical time,” he says. It’s also temporary. “We have no plans to expand into this segment.”
Vuong identifies as a patriot above all else, and he says he wants his company to keep adding to the list of firsts for Vietnam. “I always tell my colleagues: don’t let your life pass by without meaning,’’ he said. “Don’t let it be that at the end of your life, you have nothing that’s worth remembering or retelling. It would be a miserable ending to see that your life didn’t add any value.”

The Nasdaq has climbed 44.7% from its March 23 bottom. A bull market is confirmed once the index makes a new high and is considered to have begun at the index's low, according to a widely accepted definition.
The S&P 500 remains about 4.5% below its record high close, while the Dow is about 6.7% below.
A closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday showed an unexpected fall in unemployment rate, bolstering views that the worst of the economic damage from the virus outbreak was over.
""It's optimism surrounding the reopening of the global economy, and the likely confirmation that the U.S. economy will experience a V-shaped recovery in the second half,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. 
Stocks added to gains late in the session after the U.S. Federal Reserve eased the terms of its ""Main Street"" lending program.
The energy sector climbed the most among the 11 major S&P sectors, rising 4.3%, as major oil producers agreed over the weekend to extend a deal on record output cuts.
Beaten-down shares of cruise operators Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings Ltd continued to recover. The S&P 1500 airlines index jumped 9.9%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 461.46 points, or 1.7%, to 27,572.44, the S&P 500 gained 38.46 points, or 1.20%, to 3,232.39 and the Nasdaq Composite added 110.66 points, or 1.13%, to 9,924.75.
Investors will also focus this week on the Fed's two-day policy meeting, ending on Wednesday, where the jobs report will most likely be discussed.
It would be the first meeting since April when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy could feel the weight of the economic shutdown for more than a year.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.61-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 83 new highs and no new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 16.46 billion shares, compared to the 12.35 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com - Macy's (NYSE:M) jumped in after-hours trade Monday, after the department store retailer said it had raised about $4.5 billion of new financing in a bid to shore up its balance sheet. 
The company said it intended to use the proceeds to pay down debt.
""Together, the notes offering and asset-based credit agreement provide Macy’s, Inc. with approximately $4.5 billion of borrowings and commitments, giving us sufficient flexibility and liquidity to navigate our current environment and fund our business for the foreseeable future,” said Jeff Gennette, chairman and chief executive officer of Macy’s.
The $4.5 billion of new financing included the previously announced $1.3 billion of 8.375% senior secured notes, as well as a new $3.15 billion asset-based credit agreement.
The company also amended and reduced the credit commitments of its existing $1.5 billion unsecured credit agreement. "

Investing.com -- Wall Street greeted news of a recession by rallying on Monday, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite closing at a new high above 9,900.
Investors scooped up stocks on indications the recession, which data show officially began in February, might not be long-lived. New York City began the slow process of reopening for business on Monday, fueling optimism for energy, industrial and financial stocks.
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve begins its regular two-day meeting. They will be watching a closely followed report that morning on job openings for signs of employment trends. Wholesale inventories will also be reported and earnings reports are due from Brown Forman and Chewy.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. JOLTS Data Closely Watched as Fed Meets
The Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Market Survey for April (JOLTS) is due out Tuesday at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT) and is expected to show openings of 5 million, against 6.19 million the prior month.
The report will also highlight vacancies versus job seekers. Before the beginning of Covid-19 shutdowns, the JOLTS showed how tight the labor market was getting amid 50-year-low unemployment rates.
2. Wholesale Inventories Expected to Bounce Back
Data on wholesale inventories at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT) are expected to show a rise of 0.4% month over month compared to -0.8% the prior month. Any data on business activity is likely to capture the attention of investors as New York City begins to reopen for business after a 100-day shutdown over Covid-19.
The data comes as oil prices recover some of their losses of the last few months and as stocks continue their uphill trajectory.
3. Profit Reports From Consumer-Oriented Firms
The stay at home orders during Covid-19 didn't hurt a variety of firms that rely on consumer spending, especially household product makers and grocers. Now a new slate of earnings are expected from companies that are expected to be somewhat shielded by Covid-19 closings.
Spirits maker Brown Forman (NYSE:BFb) is expected to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 28 cents a share on revenue $695 million. The company makes liquor brands including Jack Daniel's and Finlandia. And online pet food and grooming product supplier Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) is scheduled to report profit of 18 cents a share on revenue of $1.5 billion."

(Reuters) - On the same day that the Nasdaq marked a new bull market, the U.S. economy was officially declared to be in a recession. The two milestones on Monday illustrate how an 11-week surge in stocks has occurred despite widespread economic devastation fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.
Driven higher in recent months by surging technology and communications stocks, the Nasdaq (IXIC) closed up 0.8% on Monday at 9,924.75 points, exceeding its previous record high on Feb. 19, just before fears of the coronavirus ended its 11-year bull market. 
Stocks added to gains late in the session after the U.S. Federal Reserve eased the terms of its ""Main Street"" lending program.
The index's 44% climb from its March 23 low stands in contrast to sharp deteriorations in gross domestic product and other economic indicators as a result of nationwide lockdowns, which are now easing. 
(Graphic: Wall St vs Main St, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegpbyengvq/main%20St.jpg)
The index's 11-week surge has been the largest in that amount of time since late 2001, during the dot-com boom. Closing at a record high confirms, by a common definition, that the Nasdaq began a new bull market following its March 23 low.
Wall Street for months has appeared to ignore grim economic readings as investors focus on trillions of dollars in government stimulus and bet that a recovery would be relatively quick. 
Underscoring that disconnect and confirming wide expectations, the private research group that acts as the arbiter for determining U.S. business cycles said on Monday that the U.S. economy ended its longest expansion in history in February, and entered recession as a result of the coronavirus.
(Graphic: The COVID-19 Recession, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzqarmpw/Pasted%20image%201591635388754.png)
The National Bureau of Economic Research said, ""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions."" 
The S&P 500, the most widely followed U.S. stock index, remains down about 5% from its Feb. 19 record high as uncertainty about the recovery lingers. The Nasdaq's outperformance highlights investors' willingness to bet that tech companies will emerge stronger from the pandemic. 
(Graphic: Nasdaq vs S&P 500, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklpygleypg/Nasdaq%20vs%20SP.jpg) 
Many investors in recent months have bet that massive corporations with robust balance sheets will build on competitive advantages and grab market share from smaller rivals struggling to survive the global health crisis. 
Microsoft (O:MSFT), Apple (O:AAPL) and Alphabet (O:GOOGL) have outperformed most stocks within the Nasdaq, while Amazon (O:AMZN) and Facebook (O:FB) have set record highs in recent weeks. 
(Graphic: Market cap winners and losers, https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgvdkgmepo/Market%20Cap%20winners%20and%20losers.jpg)
Since Feb. 19, the end of the previous Nasdaq bull market, Amazon's stock market value has increased by over $170 billion, far more than any other U.S. company, as investors bet that shopping will move further online and that Amazon's cloud computing business will grow quickly. Alphabet, still down 6% since Feb. 19, has lost about $25 billion, more than any other U.S. company, according to Refinitiv data. Microsoft and Apple are Wall Street's most valuable companies.
Due to the cloudy economic outlook, many companies in recent months have withdrawn or declined to provide earnings guidance, making it difficult for investors to value stocks based on future earnings. Still, the Nasdaq now trades at a trailing price/earnings multiple of 31, a level last seen in 2004 in the wake of the bursting of the dot-com bubble.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq closed at a record high on Monday, as optimism the economy will emerge from the recession sooner rather than later continued to underpin investor sentiment on risk.
The Nasdaq Composite rose 1.13%, to 9,924.75, closing above 9,900 for the first time ever. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.70%, or 461 points,  and the S&P 500 gained 1.21% to turn positive for the year.
The record day for the tech-heavy Nasdaq was helped by a turnaround in some FAANG stocks following intraday weakness as signs of progress on reopening the U.S. continued to drive expectations for a quicker economic recovery.
New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic, began to reopen on Monday, boosting hopes of a quicker economic recovery just as data showed the U.S. officially entered a recession in February, marking an end to its longest expansion on record.
""The unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions,"" The National Bureau of Economic Research said. 
Optimism on the economy has continued to galvanize cyclical sectors like energy, industrials and financials. 
Energy led the broader move higher, shrugging off a fall in oil prices after Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait said they would end voluntary output cuts.
The announcement arrived as OPEC and its allies, collectively known as OPEC+, agreed on Saturday to extend production cuts (set in April) through July.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) jumped 7% to close at a record high after data showed demand for its Model 3 in China returned in May, triggering bullish commentary on Wall Street.
In May, Tesla sold 11,000 Model 3 vehicles according to initial reports, up from just under 4,000 sold in April.

The management reshuffle comes after weeks of squabbling between Volkswagen's powerful labour leaders and managers over the pace and scale of cost cutting plans to free up resources for a radical shift toward electric cars.
Volkswagen said Brandstaetter would take over on July 1 to give Diess, who remains group chief executive, more leeway to run the rest of the company, which includes brands such as Audi, Bentley, Skoda, Lamborghini and Porsche. 
“Ralf Brandstaetter is one of the company’s most experienced managers,” Diess said in a statement. “I am therefore very pleased that Ralf Brandstaetter will be forging ahead with the development of the brand as CEO.”
Volkswagen said Diess retained overall responsibility for Volkswagen passenger cars and that the management reshuffle would also result in the departure of procurement and components chief Stefan Sommer.
Sommer joined VW in 2018 and oversaw ambitious procurement plans, including the construction of large factories to power Volkswagen's ambitious electrification shift as the carmaker encountered supply bottlenecks.
Earlier on Monday, sources told Reuters that Volkswagen's supervisory board was hosting an extraordinary meeting to discuss replacing Diess as CEO of the VW brand.
Diess is trying to get the company's powerful labour leaders, who control nine of the 19 seats on the supervisory board, to agree to painful costs cuts.
The savings are designed to help pay for a 34 billion euro ($38 billion) investment in electric and autonomous cars and 50 billion euros for EV battery procurement.

Diess also came under pressure after Volkswagen was forced to halt sales of its newest VW Golf model because of software glitches at a time when the company is preparing to mass produce VW's ID.3 electric car.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 02:52PM ET</span>",Catching up: How much further can emerging assets run?,"By Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - The global risk rally has lifted some badly bruised emerging assets, but investment managers are split on how much momentum is left to support developing stocks, bonds and currencies amid the challenges of kickstarting coronavirus-hit economies.
Investors pulled more than $80 billion from developing stocks and bonds in March as the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and a oil shock ripped through world markets.
Since then, some of that money has returned, especially to Asia. Emerging bonds' premiums over underlying safe assets have snapped in as yields came off recent highs, and as emerging currencies have steadied. Adding to the tailwinds for risk assets has been a steady decline in the dollar in recent weeks.
Betting on a recovery of assets from emerging economies that are on the cusp of reopening whilst still grappling with high or climbing infection numbers - such as Brazil or India, means risks are also high.
(GRAPHIC - Emerging stocks lag: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbybzgpq/emerging%20market%20stocks%20lag%20global%20equities%20recovery.JPG)
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said in its latest global asset allocation note it had added both emerging market equity and fixed income to its model portfolio. Assets outside China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and Singapore have lagged the recovery so far, the note said.
""We see a good chance of them catching up,"" JPM's Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou told clients. ""Our EM position indicators are supportive of a bullish view on EM risky assets.""
So far though, only a fraction of the money which fled has been induced to return. Emerging market bonds and stocks saw inflows of $17.1 billion in April and $4.1 billion last month. However, excluding China, emerging stocks continued to suffer outflows in May.
Much depends on whether developing markets would be able to avoid a widespread pickup in COVID infection rates when emerging from their lockdowns, said Goldman Sach analysts in a recent note.
""If medical outcomes in EMs can continue to avoid left-tail scenarios, our analysis implies tactical upside in EM high yield credit, LatAm equities and EM FX,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS)' Kamakshya Trivedi said.
However, there are risks in high-yielding countries where infection rates are high, Trivedi added, citing Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico, the Philippines, Turkey and South Africa.
(GRAPHIC - Emerging currencies enjoy gains in June: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkdqowvm/Emerging%20currencies%20enjoy%20gains%20in%20June.JPG)
These economies still face major hurdles before they can return to growth, which is why many funds are biding their time.
""Large emerging countries like India, Brazil, Mexico where we are still in the early to mid-stage of the spread of virus ... there (it) is still unclear about growth prospects post-COVID, so you have to keep analysing,"" said Neeraj Seth, head of Asian credit at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
""That is still reflected in our portfolios.""
David Hauner at Bofa noted that emerging local- and hard-currency debt had little risk premium left after the May rally. while several central banks have started pushing back against letting their currencies appreciate.
""EM has rallied hard, and we are starting to worry about complacency,"" Hauner added, warning investors to curb their ""EMthusiasm"".
And after the torrent of stimulus in the euro zone, United States and China -- from central banks as well as governments -- there are questions over how much more can be delivered.

""The good news from the big global policy decisions seems priced in by now,"" said Hauner.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Private equity investors are seeking Chinese companies to take private in the hope they can snap up bargains amid the coronavirus-related sell-off, but the banks that help find such deals are proving less keen to finance them.
Interest in Chinese take-private deals is also rising along with tension between China and the United States, as several companies considering whether to keep a New York listing or move instead to Shanghai, Shenzhen or Hong Kong.
In April, private equity firm Ocean Link offered to buy Nasdaq-listed online classifieds marketplace 58.Com Inc (N:WUBA) for $8.3 billion in equity value, a premium of 17.8% to its undisturbed price in the largest Chinese take-private deal so far this year. 
Bigger deals may also be in the offing. Internet giant Baidu (O:BIDU), with a market cap of $39.4 billion, is considering delisting from Nasdaq and moving to an exchange closer to home to boost its valuation, Reuters reported in May.
Baidu shares have fallen 9.5% this year while the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index (HXC), which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese firms, has gained 12%.
""The best time to cut take-private deals would be after a big crisis,"" said David Liu, founding partner of Asia-based private equity firm DCP Capital.
""It's easier to conduct privately negotiated transactions with listed companies at more attractive valuations in this environment.""
'FAR FROM STRAIGHTFORWARD'
Funding however is the most challenging issue for any take-private deal.
""The banks are being extra careful these days,"" said Liu, adding that the caution was prompted by the risks posed to loan books amid the global economic downturn.
Samson Lo, head of Asia M&A at UBS, said financing was ""far from straightforward"" in the current environment. 
""Banks tend to lend to repeat customers with visible long-term revenue streams, from financing a particular (deal), through future refinancing, to ultimate exits,"" he added.
Lenders are also valuing companies below what bidders want to offer, with some going as much as 20% to 30% below the acquisition price because of a more cautious outlook, said Effie Vasilopoulos, a partner with law firm Sidley Austin. 
""How do you catch a falling knife? A common response has been to adopt very conservative valuations,"" she said. ""We have not seen this dynamic in terms of financing and valuations fully play out yet. It is likely that the worst is yet to come in terms of market impact.""
A Hong Kong-based loans banker with a Wall Street firm said the bank would not underwrite, or guarantee loan sizes, in case it proved unable to fully syndicate them to other banks.
Buyers would have to put in more equity and tap alternative sources of debt, said the banker, which could raise the cost of a deal - and lower the expected returns.
Chinese banks may offer a glimmer of hope, however. With big balance sheets and strong domestic relationships, they are more willing to lend to home clients.
58.com's consortium of buyers, which includes private equity firms Warburg Pincus (WP.UL) and General Atlantic, is in talks with Chinese banks for about $3 billion in financing, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter, adding that global banks find the figure challenging. 
Warburg Pincus declined to comment. 58.com, Ocean Link and General Atlantic did not respond to requests for comments.
Some shareholders of Hong Kong- and U.S.-listed companies seeking outside funds to help them go private, have also turned to local governments in China, said another person with direct knowledge of the moves. 

The people sought anonymity because of confidentiality constraints.

According to a widely accepted definition, the tech-heavy index must officially end above its record high close at 9,817.18 on Feb. 19, before the spread of COVID-19 closed economies across the globe, to designate that a new bull market began when it bottomed on March 23 to close at 6,860.674. 
Monday marked back-to-back intraday records for the Nasdaq. On Friday it became the first of the big three indexes to bounce back to a record high. 
Following Wall Street's crash into bear territory in March, investors have bet on a revival in business activity with the easing of a nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus.
The stock market is still buoyed by Friday's surprisingly strong May U.S. jobs report, which gave the clearest signal yet that the worst of the downturn triggered by the pandemic was probably behind, although the road to recovery could still be long. 
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 35.35 points, or 0.36%, to 9,849.43 by early afternoon, peaking at 9,853.52. It is the largest 53-day gain since 2001.

(Reuters) - Wall Street is betting on a strong recovery from the coronavirus pandemic by pouring money into shares of U.S. oil refiners, even though demand for gasoline, jet fuel and diesel remains well below seasonal lows.
Shares of  Valero Energy  Corp (NYSE:VLO) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) were trading on Monday at their highest levels since the first week of March. Brokerage  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) raised its price target on certain independent refiners, saying demand was on an upswing as lockdowns ease across the United States.
“The stock market has definitely priced in an incredibly strong recovery,” said Warren Pies, energy strategist at Ned Davis Research. ""Probably more than is taking place.""
Refining stocks have typically performed better than exploration and production companies since at least 2016, according to Refinitiv. 
“Investors are accustomed to buying refining when they buy energy because it's the only sector that hasn't blown them up in the last ten years,” said a downstream energy investor who requested to remain anonymous.
Many refiners drew down on their cash loads in recent months due to weak demand and poor margins. The refining crack spread, a proxy for margins, is hovering around $11 a barrel, compared with nearly $21 at the same time last year.
U.S. fuel demand dropped by nearly 30% due to lockdowns to manage the pandemic. As of the end of May, gasoline and distillate demand was still 20% lower year-on-year, product exports fell 14% and distillate inventories were at their highest since September 2010, according to government data. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) has lowered second and third quarter earnings estimates for refiners, citing product builds. Analyst Manav Gupta pointed to the closing of a Cheyenne, Wyoming refinery.

""We don’t believe Cheyenne is the last refinery in the U.S. that will be shuttered or converted,"" he wrote.

Government-backed Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp (CMHC) said last week it would tighten rules for offering mortgage insurance from July 1, after forecasting declines of between 9% and 18% in home prices over the next 12 months.
The move would make it harder for riskier borrowers, who offer downpayments of less than 20%, to access CMHC's default mortgage insurance.
Genworth Canada Chief Executive Officer Stuart Levings said the company, which provides mortgage default insurance to Canadian residential mortgage lenders, was able to manage its mortgage insurance exposure, including to borrowers with lower credit scores or higher debt service ratios.
Credit ratings agency DBRS Morningstar added CMHC's changes to its underwriting requirements may make buying a home more challenging for insured borrowers, primarily first-time homebuyers. 
Despite evaporating activity in the housing market due to the COVID-19 pandemic, prices have continued to rise as listings have fallen off alongside demand.

447,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",SAA rescue plan delayed again after unions object,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Creditors of South African Airways (SAA) on Monday approved another delay in the publication of a rescue plan after the cash-strapped airline's administrators requested an extension because of an objection by trade unions.
The rescue plan for SAA, which has not made a profit since 2011, was due to be published on Monday. It has been repeatedly pushed back amid fierce wrangling over the airline's future.
The government and unions have been pressing for SAA to be salvaged in some form, despite its longstanding frailties being exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has pushed even previously profitable airlines into financial distress.
A spokeswoman for the administrators, who were appointed in December when SAA entered a local form of bankruptcy protection, said creditors had granted a one-week delay in the publication of the rescue plan to June 15.
The administrators requested the extension after the NUMSA, SACCA and SAAPA unions objected to the plan being published on Monday pending further talks with the government on a draft version of the plan.

A draft plan late last month proposed a restructuring funded by more bailouts. It also suggested cutting the airline's workforce and aircraft fleet roughly in half.

452,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Volkswagen supervisory board to discuss VW brand leadership - sources,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Herbert Diess may lose responsibility for managing the company's core VW brand at an extraordinary supervisory board meeting due to be held on Monday, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Diess, who has come under fire after Volkswagen struggled to manage the launch of its next-generation flagship VW Golf, will remain chief executive of the group, which includes the Audi, Seat, Skoda, Audi, Porsche and Bentley brands, the sources said.
The contenders who could succeed Diess as head of the VW brand include Volkswagen's Chief Operating Officer Ralf Brandstaetter and Porsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume.
The discussions are ongoing and have not reached a conclusion, the sources said. 
Volkswagen declined to comment.
The power struggle at the top of the world's largest carmaker comes as Diess attempts to get the company's labour leaders, who control nine of the 19 seats on the supervisory board, to agree to painful costs cuts.
Diess has been pushing to cut costs in Germany to help pay for a 34 billion euro ($38 billion) investment in electric and autonomous cars and 50 billion euros for EV battery procurement. 
If directors from the German state of Lower Saxony, which controls a 20% stake in the carmaker, side with labour leaders they can veto significant decisions by Volkswagen's management.
Diess was appointed head of the VW brand in 2015 after defecting from BMW (DE:BMWG) and then climbed to the position of group chief executive in April 2018.
His grip on the car and truck manufacturer seemed to have increased after German prosecutors dropped a market manipulation investigation against him last month.
However, he has been criticised after Volkswagen was forced to halt sales of its newest Golf because of software glitches at a time the company is preparing to mass produce VW's ID.3 electric car. 

In addition to forcing Volkswagen to embark on a radical electrification strategy in the wake of the carmaker's diesel-cheating scandal, Diess appointed BMW manager Markus Duesmann as the head of Audi.

The following measures have been agreed in cross-party compromises that parliament's economic affairs committee will vote by email on Monday, with the result announced on Tuesday.
LOAN LOSSES
Banks have to calculate provisions for loans expected to turn sour, but they would not have to reflect the losses with capital increases during 2020 and 2021, and only gradual recognition from 2022 to 2024.
For the next seven years, any loan that has a state-backed guarantee would be exempt from increased capital requirements.
PRUDENTIAL FILTER
Introduction of a temporary ""filter"" for 2020 and 2021 that would ease the capital hit on banks arising from unrealised losses on government debt that occurred during extreme market volatility in the crisis.
LEVERAGE RATIO
The ratio is a measure of capital to a bank's assets on a non-risk weighted basis. Banks could exclude reserves held at central banks from the leverage ratio calculation for up to a year to free up balance sheet room to lend more. State-backed loans could be excluded from leverage ratio calculation.
SOFTWARE INVESTMENTS
A rule change due in June 2021 that banks do not have to deduct the value of software investments from capital would be brought forward by a year.
SUPPORTING FACTOR
This refers to lighter capital treatment on banks' loans to small companies and infrastructure. Start date brought forward by a year to June to aid recovery.
EURO BONDS ISSUED BY NON-EU STATES
Reintroduction of zero-risk weighting on banks' holdings of sovereign bonds issued in the currency of another member state in the EU, to avoid punitive capital charges. Backdated to Jan. 1, 2020.
BONUSES AND DIVIDENDS
Linking the capital relief measures to curbs in banker bonuses and dividends to shareholders watered down to a token nod that encourages regulators to use existing powers.
WHAT NEXT?
Parliament has joint say on the package with EU states and final approval is expected this month in time for banks' second-quarter earnings.

Israel's flag carrier on Sunday extended a suspension of scheduled commercial flights until June 30 but said it would continue to use its aircraft for cargo and occasional passenger flights.
While Israel has eased its coronavirus restrictions in the past few weeks, incoming passengers are still required to self isolate and a ban on foreigners entering the country remains in place.
Due to weak demand, El Al halted flights in late March and the suspension has been extended repeatedly.
El Al has been seeking state-backed loans of $400 million to help it through the coronavirus crisis. The government is asking the airline to issue $150 million in shares as part of the bailout package that would require significant cost-cutting measures. It also includes a $250 million state-backed loan.
In a letter to employees, chief executive Gonen Usishkin said El Al is studying the latest government offer. 

""We are at a critical junction for El Al's future and are doing everything we can to find the way to ensure prosperity and a stable and secure future for El Al,"" he wrote, adding that the airline needs funds to pay its debts to customers and suppliers.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler's (MI:FCHA) planned $50 billion merger with  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) maker PSA (PA:PEUP) has hit a bump after EU regulators voiced concerns about the companies' market share in small vans, indicating concessions may be required, sources said.
Fiat and PSA, which are seeking to create the world's fourth biggest carmaker, were told of the European Commission's concerns last week, according to the sources familiar with the matter.
If the two companies fail to dispel those concerns in the next two days and then decline to offer concessions by Wednesday, the deadline for doing so, the deal would face a four-month investigation once the preliminary review ends.
The EU competition enforcer, which has set a June 17 deadline for concluding its preliminary review, declined to comment. Fiat and PSA also declined to comment.
Fiat Chrysler and PSA already produce vans through a 50-50 joint venture called Sevel. Based in Atessa, Italy, Sevel is Europe's largest assembly plant for vans, producing 1,200 units a day before interruptions due to the coronavirus.
According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA), the two carmakers produced a total of 755,000 light commercial vehicles last year, giving them a potential combined market share of around 34%, the market leader, followed by  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Ford (N:F) with about a 16% market share each.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) had 12% of the market and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) 10%. 
Hiving off overlapping businesses - usually a regulatory demand to ensure more competition - could prove tricky for Fiat Chrysler and PSA because of the technicalities.
News of the European Commission's concerns trimmed gains in the two carmakers' share prices on Monday.
Fiat Chrysler shares were up 1.56% in late trade, after rising more than 3% in early trading, while PSA shares, were 2.4% higher, after rising more than 4% early in the day.
Fiat and PSA are looking to merge to help offset slowing demand and shoulder the cost of making cleaner vehicles to meet tougher emissions regulations.
The deal will put the Italian carmaker's brands including Fiat, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Maserati and the French company's Peugeot, Opel and DS all under one roof.

Shares in Fiat Chrysler and PSA have both slumped by nearly 30% since the start of this year due to the impact of the coronavirus.

The storm’s travels in the Gulf of Mexico shut more than a third of offshore energy production there. Moving forward, though, farmers with parched fields in the western Midwest will gain from the downpours, said Don Keeney, a meteorologist with commercial forecaster Maxar.
“The net-net is beneficial for the crops, at least in the western Midwest,” Keeney said. “Minnesota, Iowa and northwest Wisconsin are certainly going to get some good rains.”
As Cristobal came ashore Sunday, parts of southern Louisiana were evacuated and President Donald Trump said he will sign an emergency declaration, which helps free up federal funds and resources. From 3 to 5 inches (8 to 13 centimeters) of rain could fall across a large swath of the Mississippi Valley in the next few days, according to the U.S. Weather Prediction Center.
As Cristobal crossed the Gulf, larger weather patterns stretched out its shape, leading some of its worst impacts to occur well to the east of its track. Now, the storm is expected to merge with another system as it continues up the Mississippi River Valley. It will eventually transition into a powerful late spring storm as it crosses the Great Lakes into Canada, according to the hurricane center.
Cristobal is the third storm to form in the Atlantic this year, marking the fastest start to hurricane season on record.

AstraZeneca contacted Gilead last month but the U.S. company, which is testing its drug remdesivir as a COVID-19 treatment, was not interested in combining with another big drugmaker, Bloomberg reported.
Gilead's shares, which have risen about 18% this year through Friday's close, pared some of their premarket gains after CNBC reported citing sources that the companies were not in active talks.
AstraZeneca's shares fell 2.8% on the FTSE 100 as investors contemplated a large payout and questioned the rationale of a deal that would create a company with a combined market value of about $232 billion, based on Friday's closing prices.
A merger would also unite two drugmakers at the forefront of efforts to fight the new coronavirus but could be politically sensitive as governments seek control over potential vaccines or treatments.
Gilead's remdesivir is the first drug to show improvement in COVID-19 patients in formal trials, while AstraZeneca is racing to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 through its partnership with Oxford University.
""(Gilead) may be on the verge of having one of the fastest growing products in the industry, if they can successfully establish profitable commercial pricing for remdesivir,"" said SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges.
Any potential deal may suggest that AstraZeneca is looking to diversify away from its dependence on cancer drugs, he added.
Analysts also saw a deal as uncertain given the political environment.

Citi analyst Andrew Baum said he anticipated that the U.S. administration would likely seek to block any potential acquisition of any major U.S. biopharma involved in the development of future therapeutics for the pandemic.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",The future is orange: Campari tests selling Aperol in China,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) -  Campari  (MI:CPRI) is testing selling Aperol in China as the Italian spirits group looks to its photogenic orange-flavoured aperitif to revive sales hit by the coronavirus pandemic. 
""The test started a few weeks ago and will last until the first quarter of next year,"" CEO Bob Kunze-Concewitz told Reuters on Monday, adding trials were taking place in more than five of China's biggest cities.
The bright orange aperitif, the main ingredient in the Aperol Spritz cocktail, has driven Campari's growth in recent years, proving particularly popular among drinkers who post pictures on social media sites. 
However, the company's growth was brought to an abrupt halt in the first quarter of this year by the coronavirus pandemic, with underlying sales falling 5.3%. Aperol's sales dipped 0.2% after 20.5% growth in 2019. 
In many countries, drinkers have switched to Aperol Spritz from beer, the company says. And now it aims to achieve the same in China by pitching Aperol as an Italian life-style product that consumers might have tasted on European holidays. 
""Beer substitution has been a big source of demand for Aperol and China is a huge beer market. That's why we strongly believe in the opportunity to develop Aperol in China,"" Kunze-Concewitz said in an interview.
Last year, Campari's sales in China accounted for less than 1% of a total turnover of 1.84 billion euros ($2.08 billion).
With bars and restaurants in its traditional markets shut to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the group has been expanding its online business and digital marketing.
On Friday, it agreed to buy 49% of e-commerce wines and spirits company Tannico.
In the United States, Campari's biggest market, so-called off-premise sales surged between 50% and 60% year-on-year in April and May, offsetting the fall from restaurants and bars, Kunze-Concewitz said.
The same happened in Canada, Australia, Germany and northern Europe. 
However in Italy, Campari's second biggest market, a rise in e-commerce and supermarket sales was not enough to offset the closure of food and drink outlets, meaning the worst impact of the virus pandemic on the company will be felt in the second quarter - traditionally the peak for aperitif sales.
""The coronavirus will have a bigger negative impact on our business in the second quarter, even if consumption in the last months was encouraging,"" Kunze-Concewitz said, adding Campari would not issue any 2020 financial guidance due to the coronavirus uncertainty.

469,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Oil major BP to cut 15% of workforce,"By Shadia Nasralla and Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) will cut about 15% of its workforce in response to the coronavirus crisis and as part of Chief Executive Bernard Looney's plan to shift the oil and gas major to renewable energy, it said on Monday.
Looney told employees in a global online call that the London-based company will cut 10,000 jobs from the current 70,100.
""We will now begin a process that will see close to 10,000 people leaving BP – most by the end of this year,"" Looney said in a statement.
Reuters had earlier reported the planned job cuts, citing three company sources.
BP shares were up 3.3% by 1230 GMT, against a 2.2% gain for the broader European energy sector.
The affected roles will be mostly senior office-based positions and not front-line operational staff, the company said.
About a fifth of the job cuts will take place in Britain, where BP employs 15,000 people, a company spokesman said.
Like all the world's top energy companies, BP has cut its 2020 spending plans after the coronavirus pandemic brought an unprecedented drop in demand for oil. BP has flagged a 25% cut to $12 billion this year and said it would find $2.5 billion in cost savings by the end of 2021 through the digitalisation and integration of its businesses.
On Monday, however, Looney said the company is likely to need to cut costs even further.
BP is giving no pay rises to senior employees until March 2021 and said it is unlikely to pay any cash bonuses this year.
ENERGY TRANSITION
The job reductions are also part of Looney's drive to make the 111-year-old oil company more nimble as it prepares for the shift to low-carbon energy, the sources said.
""It was always part of the plan to make BP a leaner, faster-moving and lower-carbon company,"" Looney said.
The spokesman said that the coronavirus crisis ""amplified and accelerated"" BP's transition plans.
Looney last month announced a large round of senior management appointments, halving the size of BP's leaderhip team under his plan to reshape the company's structure. 
Shortly after taking office in February, the 49-year-old CEO said that he was creating 11 divisions to ""reinvent"" BP and dismantle the traditional structure dominated by its oil and gas production business and its refining, marketing and trading division.
 Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil producer, last month said that it will cut between 10% and 15% of its global workforce as part of an ongoing restructuring.
Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), meanwhile, has initiated a voluntary redundancy programme.

472,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 07:11AM ET</span>","Samsung leader appears in court, waits to hear if he'll be jailed again","By Hyunjoo Jin and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung (KS:005930) Group's leader, Jay Y. Lee, appeared before a South Korean court on Monday, awaiting a ruling on whether new allegations including accounting fraud and stock manipulation will send him back to jail after more than two years of freedom.
Prosecutors last week asked the court to issue an arrest warrant against Lee, culminating a probe into a controversial 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates that they said helped facilitate Lee's plan to assume greater control of the group.
The risk of more jail time for Lee, who has led the group since his father's heart attack in 2014, has cast a pall over the conglomerate and its crown jewel, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co, whose annual revenue alone is equivalent to 12% of South Korea's gross domestic product.
Lee, 51, wearing a face mask and a dark suit, appeared at the Seoul court for a hearing that began at 10:30 a.m. (0230 GMT) and ended more than eight hours later around 7 p.m. 
The Samsung Electronics vice chairman did not answer questions from reporters. The decision on whether he will be arrested is expected late Monday or early Tuesday. 
The court can then order Lee be detained for 20 days while prosecutors proceed with investigations. After that charges must be filed and he be put on trial. During a trial, Lee can then be detained for up to six months.
Investors, however, don't expect disruptions in the day-to-day running of Samsung which has a deep backbench of professional managers, noting the group has coped without him before. 
Lee was jailed for about one year until Feb. 2018 for his role in a bribery scandal, accused of giving horses to the daughter of a confidante of former President Park Geun-hye to win government support for the merger of the two affiliates.
""It is unlikely that Samsung will be in trouble even with Lee’s absence. But the case rekindles governance concerns at South Korean conglomerates,"" said Park Jung-hoon, fund manager at HDC Asset Management. 
""Investors are fed up with these controversies.""
Samsung Electronics' stock has moved little since the arrest warrant request on Thursday.
CONTENTIOUS MERGER
The new allegations contend Lee was involved in illegal transactions and stock manipulation that furthered the 2015 merger of the affiliates, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. Prosecutors also allege he had a role in inflating the value of Samsung Biologics Co Ltd, which counted Cheil Industries as a major shareholder.
The merger was seen as key to Lee increasing control of the sprawling group but critics say it rode roughshod over the interests of minority investors. 
Samsung on Friday denied the allegation of stock-manipulation against Lee, saying it was ""beyond common sense"" to claim Lee was involved in the decision-making.
In a further statement over the weekend, the group said the lengthy probe is weighing on management, which is in ""crisis"" at a time when the coronavirus pandemic and U.S.-China trade disputes are adding to uncertainty.
The company declined to make Lee available for comment.
In South Korea, economic power is highly concentrated in several chaebol or conglomerates, many of which have run into controversy over succession problems.
Prior to his father's heart attack and subsequent hospitalisation, Jay Y. Lee and his sisters held little of Samsung Electronics and they have since sought to assert more control over the group through the two affiliates.

While Lee has served time for the bribery scandal, South Korea's Supreme Court has since overturned an appeals court decision to suspend his sentence. It is unclear when there will be a new court ruling over whether he will have to serve further jail time for that conviction.

473,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Meet the Other Tech Companies Propping Up Canada’s Stock Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc. may be hogging all the headlines but there are other tech companies keeping the rebound going on Canada’s stock market this year.
Shopify’s near 90% surge this year has put it in the No. 1 spot on the S&P/TSX Composite Index but Kinaxis Inc. and Real Matters Inc. are close behind, up 70% and 67% respectively -- making them the third and fourth largest gainers. Hydrogen fuel cell company Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) Inc. is second with a 75% gain.
These tech stars may not have a catchy acronym like FAANG in the U.S., BAT (LON:BATS) in Asia or even WAAAX in Australia but investors have flocked to these names due to their stronger growth outlook compared with other sectors during the coronavirus pandemic.
“There’s a view that the pandemic should actually help accelerate tech adoption in a bunch of different areas because ultimately technology is one of the only ways to mitigate some of the impact of the pandemic,” Thanos Moschopoulos, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said by phone.
Kinaxis has become “especially topical” given its supply chain management software can help companies track global shipments amid the havoc caused by Covid-19, and to help mitigate the challenges, Moschopoulos said.
Last month, the Ottawa-based company reported a 15% increase in revenue and maintained its 2020 guidance, which included a sales forecast that’s about 10% to 12% higher than 2019.
With the bulk of its revenues coming from the U.S. mortgage industry, low interest rates are keeping things busy for Real Matters. The Markham, Ontario-based provider of network services for the mortgage and insurance industries has seen increased refinancing volumes as central banks cut rates to pump financial markets with liquidity during the global recession.
Sky-high valuations suggest things may be moving too fast, too soon. The price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P/TSX Info Tech Index is about double the five-year average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
“There’s an argument to be made that because interest rates are where they are, at record low levels, that dynamic justifies higher valuations. Tech on a relative basis is looking better than a lot of other sectors,” Moschopoulos said.
Still, recent price action in North American stock markets suggest investors are shifting away from tech and into more cyclical sectors as confidence in the recovery builds. Unexpectedly strong jobs data from Canada and the U.S. on Friday amplified this theme.
At about 9% of the Canadian benchmark, the tech sector’s impact is still small compared to the nation’s banks, miners and energy companies.
So while their shares have surged this year, helping offset some of the losses on the S&P/TSX Composite, the benchmark remains in the red for the year -- for now.

The private placement will be at a maximum price of $10.50 per share, a discount of over 16% to the stock's last close.

Oil climbed on Monday after major producers agreed to extend a deal on record output cuts to the end of July and as China's crude imports hit an all-time high in May. [O/R]
The bank said its base case expectation remained that oil markets will be progressively under-supplied in the second half of this year and inventories will shrink in the fourth quarter and first quarter next year.
But it said in a note the rally ""appears mostly supply- rather than demand-driven, and it is questionable how strong refinery runs can increase against this backdrop"". 
Refining margins are historically low and inventories of oil products remain elevated relative to crude oil inventories, suggesting the demand recovery is relatively fragile.
Consumption is unlikely to return fully to pre-coronavirus levels until the end of 2021, Morgan Stanley said, adding that inventories are unusually high after the increases in April.
Growth from U.S. shale could return to levels that are too high, if the U.S. benchmark WTI trades too far above the low-$40s, it added. 
The bank also sees a risk to OPEC's compliance with supply cuts that have led to unusually high levels of spare capacity.

""When the cuts are eventually unwound, production could rise sharply,"" it said.

The high-end French department store opened the outlet, about a tenth of the size of its flagship store on Boulevard Haussmann, in March 2019 as a retail laboratory to test new sales techniques and fashion labels.
But with borders still closed to foreign tourists and French consumers cautious, France's most famous shopping street is a shadow of its former self following the end of a nationwide lockdown on May 11. 
""It is very hard. We reopened the Champs Elysees store on May 11 but we have to face the fact that a lot of customers are missing,"" Galeries Lafayette Chief Executive Nicolas Houze said on BFM Business radio.
Houze said that since the reopening of its stores, traffic is down by about 20% compared to normal times and opening hours have been shortened for now. He said the crisis would impact the wider group's accounts by 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) or more. 
""International clients may be missing till year-end or beyond and that will weigh heavily because the Haussmann shop gets more than half of its revenue from foreigners,"" the CEO said.
He added that the family-owned company, which has 61 stores in France and abroad, was in talks with banks and the finance ministry about a 300 million euro state-guaranteed loan. 
Houze said a lot of major brands on the Champs Elysees, including the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) store, had not yet reopened and many hotels and cinemas remain closed. 
""Traffic is very low and it is difficult to earn a revenue there. But we are convinced that Galeries Lafayette has a place on Champs Elysees.""
The store had already suffered from the ""yellow vest"" protest movement last year, when the boulevard was repeatedly hit by rioting and looting.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong activist investor David Webb has said he will step back from posting his widely read critiques of companies and the city's government after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Webb, a former investment banker, has since 1998 published influential opinion pieces covering economic and corporate governance, finance, regulatory and political issues in Hong Kong on ""Webb-site.com."" 
His pieces are read widely by regulators, investors, bankers and lawyers in Hong Kong. 
In 2017, he mapped a complex web of cross-shareholdings between Hong Kong-listed companies in a report entitled ""The Enigma Network: 50 stocks not to own"". 
Just months later, 40 of the stocks were at the heart of a market crash which erased $6 billion in market capitalisation from Hong Kong's junior board. 
In Monday's post, Webb said that his life expectancy had been reduced, and that he needed to reprioritise after the diagnosis.
""I will have to be more economical with my time, but I will continue to write and speak out on the big issues where I feel it can make a difference, so don't count me out yet,"" he said. 
Webb has sent more than 1,000 letters to bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd (HK:0388) and the city's markets watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission, on topics from company disclosure lapses to trading rules, he estimated in a 2019 interview with Bloomberg.
Webb has also recently proposed changes to the ways Hong Kong lawmakers are elected by ""functional constituencies"" representing narrow special interest, typically commercial, groups. 

For 10 years he published a widely-read ""Christmas Pick"", recommending one stock with good corporate governance, but stopped in 2009 saying that while the stocks had outperformed Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI) by 552.8% over the period, it had become a distraction to his ""main goal of raising the standards of Hong Kong's corporate and economic governance"".

New rules requiring all arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days came into effect on Monday even though Ryanair, Europe's biggest budget airline, easyJet (L:EZJ) and BA-owner IAG (L:ICAG) have threatened legal action over what they cast as a draconian move that will cripple the British tourism industry.
The quarantine is designed to prevent a second surge of COVID-19 and in England a breach of the rules will be punishable with a 1,000 pound fine. It will be reviewed every three weeks and ""air bridges"" are being discussed with some top European destinations such as Portugal. 
Asked whether Ryanair would cancel July and August flights if the quarantine remained in place during those months, group CEO O'Leary said: ""No, because the flights are full outbound of the UK. British people are ignoring this quarantine, they know it's rubbish.""
""Ryanair is operating a thousand daily flights to points all over Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece from the 1st of July, the 2nd, the 3rd and every day after that.""
With planes around the world grounded since late March, airlines had hoped to start flying from July to rescue their summer season. 
The three airlines have sent a ""pre-action protocol letter"", which can be followed by legal action, to denounce the quarantine plan as ""wholly unjustified and disproportionate"". 

O'Leary said he expected British tourists to still book holidays in Europe but that European tourists would be put off travelling to Britain, hammering the domestic tourism industry.

487,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",Emerging market corporate credit quality down but not out,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on companies around the world, but in poorer emerging economies where balance sheets and credit ratings were already weak, the damage is looking particularly widespread.
Of the almost 1,800 rating cuts or downgrade warnings S&P Global has made since the virus exploded, 420 have been in emerging markets, nearly half of all the EM issuers the ratings agency monitors.
With Latin America now the epicentre of the pandemic the numbers are set to rise further. Defaults, missed payments on coupons or principal, are also likely to jump. Moody's (NYSE:MCO), another ratings agency, predicts up to 13.7% of EM corporate bonds of sub-investment or junk grade may default, meaning the proportion could narrowly top the 2008 financial crisis.
""There is virtually no country on the planet that isn't affected by this COVID crisis,"" said partner and credit analyst at fund manager GMO, Carl Ross. ""Overall credit quality is going to decline."" 
Corporate debt in emerging markets has been on a sharp upward trend over the past decade, increasing by $18 trillion to $30 trillion in the run-up to the COVID-19 outbreak, according to the Institute of International Finance.
All that extra borrowing means the drag on company earnings, which are now expected to slump 4% rather than grow 15%, is magnified - and not just in terms of defaults.
April's downgrade of Mexico’s state oil firm Pemex alone saw nearly $60 billion worth of bonds, representing 6.6% of the EM investment grade (IG) market, lowered to speculative grade.
In total, nearly 8% of EM IG corporate and quasi-sovereign issuers have now been cut to junk this year and 2020 could well surpass the record of 13.6% set in 2015 when Brazil and Russia both suffered sovereign rating downgrades to less than investment grade.
Dropping out of the coveted IG bracket matters because some large conservative money managers will not buy or retain weaker-rated assets, meaning borrowing costs rise.
J.P. Morgan analysts reckon another $25 billion of Mexican corporate debt will follow Pemex into junk if the government loses its IG status. With airlines, tourism and manufacturing all reeling around the world, extrapolating the effect globally runs into hundreds of billions of dollars.
""This is almost like the Spanish Flu and the great recession combined,"" Luis Alberto Moreno, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, said of the situation last right? week. 
GRAPHIC: Default rates starting to rise in emerging markets - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqjobnpx/Pasted%20image%201591353000309.png 
RE-EMERGING MARKETS
Not all investors are so pessimistic. Fund manager PineBridge estimates that $215 billion worth of securities are now rated BBB-, the final rung of the investment grade ladder, representing 21% of the entire IG EM corporate market, privately-held or state-owned.
But the firm's co-head of emerging markets fixed income, Steve Cook, thinks that only 3.5% is at risk of dropping though to sub-investment grade and that there will not be ""anywhere near"" the kind of default rates of which Moody's has warned. 
EM default rates have been lower than for U.S. high-yield firms, companies which are heavily indebted and rated as lower than investment grade, for 11 of the past 12 years and similarly rated companies in emerging markets carry notably less debt, Cook argues. With economies reopening and a tidal wave of global stimulus helping, PineBridge has upped its allocation to emerging markets to 20% of its portfolio from 15%.
Moreover, of the 20 EM firms now in S&P's default danger zone, only Argentine oil and gas firm YPF (BA:YPFD) and energy utility Pampa Energia (BA:PAMP), have more than $1.5 billion of bonds to their name. So the effect of defaults across the EM universe is limited, Cook argues. 
The forecast 4.3% fall in MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s 24-country EM equity index earnings (MSCIEF) is negative and represents a huge reversal from growth of 15% predicted at the start of year. But it is not nearly as savage as the 19% slump expected in the equivalent global index. This is Cook again right? (MIWD00000PUS) 
""We are not saying the emerging markets are going to be untouched here, but you have to differentiate,"" PineBridge's Cook says.

488,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 03:25AM ET</span>",Asian companies at higher risk of default this year: data,"By Patturaja Murugaboopathy and Gaurav Dogra
(Reuters) - Asian companies are at a higher risk of default in the coming quarters than last year, a Reuters analysis of their credit ratios showed, as the coronavirus pandemic has squeezed revenue and made it harder to refinance debt.
One measure of how easily a company can pay interest on outstanding debt - operating profit to interest ratio - fell to the lowest in 11 years at the end of March. The sample took into account companies worth at least $500 million with available data on Refinitiv.
Net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation), which shows how many years it would take a company to pay back debt, was at its highest since June 2014.
""We expected the pick-up in default rates to be mostly amongst smaller companies who already had a stretched liquidity profile and less access to alternative funding channels,"" said Alaa Bushehri, head of emerging market debt at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management. 
""This is being exacerbated now by COVID-19 lockdowns, slow-down in activity and a lower commodity environment.""
Energy, real estate and utilities firms topped default risk charts, Reuters found.
Airlines were the worst affected with flights grounded and people unwilling to travel. Virgin Australia, for example, entered into voluntary administration in April.
Late last month, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) forecast the default rate on high-yield debt issued by non-financial Asia-Pacific firms would climb to 6.4% by the end of this year, from 2.3% in March.
Some companies will try to restructure their debt to avoid default, especially offshore debt.
That could be an uphill task as a sharp depreciation in Asian currencies this year has increased repayment costs of companies that have borrowed in dollars and have no natural or financial hedges in place, said Buddhika Piyasena, head of Asia-Pacific Corporate Ratings at Fitch Ratings.
The yield on a bond  issued by China's Tianqi Lithium Corp (SZ:002466), for instance, climbed to about 60% last month on perceived higher risk of the company missing its interest payments this year. It is currently trading at 40%.
About $100 billion worth of dollar bonds are maturing between June 2020 and December 2021, according to Refinitiv data.
""High-yield companies with weak credit quality will likely have increasing difficulty refinancing offshore bonds, given coronavirus induced market volatility and investors' heightened risk aversion,"" Moody's analyst Sean Hwang said in a note.
""We expect investors to be increasingly selective in managing their high-yield exposure, which will weaken low-rated companies' access to funding.""

489,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 03:09AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley Makes New Bet on a Steepening U.S. Yield Curve,"(Bloomberg) --  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists added a bet on a steeper Treasury yield curve, seeing the potential for a “regime shift” in the wake of a rapidly improving U.S. economy.
“In the blink of an eye, that seems about how quickly the economic narrative has tilted in favor of a V-shaped recovery versus a slow and prolonged one,” Guneet Dhingra, head of U.S. interest-rates strategy in New York, wrote in a June 5 note. History suggests that, after a period when 30-year yields led longer-dated rates higher, it’s time for 10-year rates to become the key driver, he wrote.
The bank added a bet on the spread between three-year and 10-year yields widening to their existing so-called steepener trade call -- a wager on five-year, 30-year spreads. That’s after the unexpected surge in U.S. payrolls in May.
“If upcoming data confirms the strong improvement in the labor market in May, curve steepening could continue as strategic trade,” Dhingra wrote.
Ten-year yields jumped by almost a quarter percentage point last week as bond investors came closer to their equity colleagues’ enthusiasm about the U.S. economy reopening. The increases have raised discussion about whether the Federal Reserve might adopt the kind of caps that its counterparts in Japan and Australia have adopted for sections of the yield curve.
Fed Factor
Morgan Stanley hypothesized that the Fed might “look to push back” against market pricing after another 25 to 30 basis points of gains in 10-year yields. The yield was around 0.9% as of 7 a.m. in London Monday.
Still, the Wall Street bank doesn’t anticipate that the Fed will adopt yield-curve control or some other form of explicit forward guidance at Wednesday’s policy meeting. Morgan Stanley economists see a shift to a monthly quantitative easing target, of $80 billion. The Fed is also likely to “maintain optionality,” or keep its room for maneuver, on QE going forward, the analysts wrote.
An announcement in line with these expectations isn’t likely to provoke much of a reaction in Treasuries, the bank’s strategists said.

TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asia shares advanced on Monday after a surprise recovery in U.S. employment lifted hopes of a quicker global economic revival after many weeks of lockdowns aimed at controlling the coronavirus pandemic.
European markets were headed for a weaker open, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures down 0.5% and FTSE futures easing 0.3%. U.S. S&P 500 futures inched 0.15% higher but gave up most of the gains made earlier in the day.
""As we get more and more data that perhaps confirms that the economy is really on the mend and the second wave of infections may not be very severe, then that will boost confidence even further,"" said Vasu Menon, senior investment strategist at OCBC Bank Wealth Management.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.23%, extending gains to an eighth straight day. The index has surged 34% from 4-year lows struck in mid-March when the world was grappling with the pandemic.
The new wave of optimism was triggered by U.S. nonfarm payrolls, which unexpectedly rose by 2.509 million jobs last month - versus consensus estimates of a fall of 8 million jobs after a record plunge of 20.687 million in April.
The Labor Department's closely watched employment report also showed a surprise fall in the jobless rate to 13.3% last month from 14.7% in April, a post-World War Two high.
The data raised hopes of a quick economic recovery as governments worldwide ease social curbs aimed at stemming the virus.
""There are many clients who are cash-rich and are prepared to put money to work. The fear of missing out is very much real,"" said OCBC's Menon. 
""You see clients actually wondering whether they should get into the market because they are suddenly seeing the momentum turn."" 
The jobs data also bumped up U.S. bond yields, with the 10-year Treasuries yield rising to as high as 0.959% on Friday, a level not seen since mid-March. It last stood at 0.897%.
The sharp gains in U.S. bond yields over the past couple of days put more focus on the U.S. central bank, which will hold a two-day policy meeting ending on Wednesday.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said the U.S. economy could feel the weight of the economic shutdown for more than a year.
Chinese trade data published on Sunday also revealed the impact from the coronavirus crisis. 
Exports contracted in May as global lockdowns continued to sink demand, while a sharper-than-expected fall in imports pointed to mounting pressure on manufacturers as world growth stalls.
In Japan, revised gross domestic product data for the first quarter showed the economy contracted less than initially thought, though the outlook suggested the nation was facing its worst postwar slump due to the pandemic.
Brent crude climbed 2% to $43.16 per barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude put on 1.6% to $40.18 a barrel. [O/R] 
""The market has been rallying on hopes of economic re-openings but the actual oil demand has not risen that much yet. In a way, the market is supported by a flood of liquidity,"" said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity economist at Nomura Securities, referring to monetary easing around the world since March.
The broad improvement in sentiment weighed on both the safe-haven Japanese yen and the dollar. The yen stood at 109.4 to the dollar, near Friday's 10-week low of 109.85.
The euro changed hands at $1.1287, just shy of a three-month high of $1.1384 touched on Friday. 

Against the pound, the dollar fell 0.25% to $1.2702, close to its lowest since March 12.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) is banking on risk-taking billionaires to drive revenue growth at its wealth management division.
While most private banking clients are trying to shield their wealth from the coronavirus uncertainty by buying hedges or shifting into cash, the world's super-rich are using the market tumult as an opportunity to bargain-hunt for acquisitions and invest in higher-risk assets such as stock options and high-yield bonds.
Philipp Wehle, the head of Credit Suisse's international wealth management division, estimates this sort of activity could bring in around $400 million in additional revenues between now and the end of 2022.
""My ambition for strategic clients is to double the growth contribution over the next three years,"" said the German native, who took over as Credit Suisse's top banker for international jet-setters last July after former boss Iqbal Khan left to head wealth at UBS.
""We, myself included, are now having more discussions with clients on how to invest or reinvest into the markets, how to build strategic positions,"" he said. ""Some of our strategic clients are looking to go into more risky assets, after deleveraging before.""
""This trend is visible from conversations with ultra wealthy clients but also from business activity we were seeing. The level of transactions in April was still above pre-crisis levels.""
Wehle's division grew revenues 6% to 1.5 billion francs in the first quarter due to clients trading more. The division accounts for just under half of the bank's overall pre-tax profit.
Credit Suisse set aside $1 billion to cover the impact of the coronavirus, primarily to its corporate lending business, in the first quarter. Lending to wealthy clients, a business built up under previous CEO Tidjane Thiam, was reined in as markets went into freefall in March and some share-backed loans faced margin calls. 
""At the peak of the crisis, there were some shortfalls and margin calls. They have been mitigated down to almost zero at this stage, without material losses so far,"" Wehle said. 
While single-stock lending--often deemed a more high risk business--had been more active before the crisis, Wehle said such lending was still on offer, with the unit recently undertaking a major single stock transaction with a long-standing emerging market client.
As company valuations have dropped, ultra-wealth clients are also looking to build strategic stakes in companies.
""There is more interest now in terms of conducting smaller acquisitions,"" said Wehle.

""Our ultra wealthy clients across all regions are asking: are there good opportunities that are priced right? Are there undervalued companies where we can build a stake?""

“Presumptive Democratic nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden has proposed partially reversing the 2017 TCJA,”  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists led by David Kostin wrote in a June 5 note, referring to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. “If enacted, this tax reform would reduce our S&P 500 earnings estimate for 2021 by roughly $20 per share, from $170 to $150.”
With Biden running ahead of President Donald Trump in polls, the discussion reprises narratives before the Covid-19 shock, when liberal former contenders Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders were front-runners.
Read more: Obama Will Kill Stock Market. No, Trump Will. No, Warren Will
The Goldman strategists flagged that the electoral race is close, and the chances of any tax overhaul could evaporate. Enacting such legislation is fraught with difficulty even when a single party holds the White House and both houses of Congress, as the fight to approve Trump’s program showed back in 2017.
It was the companies with the highest effective tax rates that saw the biggest share-price benefits -- as might be expected -- from Trump’s reductions, according to Goldman’s calculations. The bank listed companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.,  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp., DaVita (NYSE:DVA) Inc. and  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V). as among that group. Many such firms face the largest risk from a tax-law revamp, Goldman said.

495,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 02:12AM ET</span>",Europe's Detroit? Pandemic bursts Toulouse aerospace bubble,"By Johanna Decorse
TOULOUSE (Reuters) - Barely three months ago, Serge Dumas had one problem: how to keep up with record demand for the metal fasteners and bolts his small aerospace supply firm manufactures just north of Toulouse.
Now, the head of Gillis Aerospace is wondering how to keep his 45 employees busy as Europe's aerospace capital reels from plummeting jetliner demand caused by the coronavirus crisis.
""In February, we were in the midst of euphoria and operating a just-in-time schedule,"" Dumas said, referring to the drum beat of a fully-stretched aerospace supply chain.
""In a few days, we went from accelerating flat-out to slamming on the brakes. We were flabbergasted.""
Now his company, which recently partnered with Germany's Boellhoff Group, has suspended an 800,000-euro ($906,700) investment in a new building and machinery.
Gillis Aerospace, with annual revenues of 5 million euros, is one of thousands of small to medium-sized firms hurt by the crisis as the French government and private lenders finalise a 1-billion-euro fund to help the sector.
Across the surrounding Occitanie region, a total of 40,000 aerospace jobs are seen at risk, up to half of which could involve Airbus, based in regional capital Toulouse.
Once basking in wealth from air transport, France's fourth largest city is alarmed by whispers that it could suffer a fate similar to Detroit, ravaged by recession in the auto industry.
Although Europe's social safety net is stronger, Detroit's experience highlights a pressing issue: how a city built around a single industry can spiral into decline when that sector is hit by economic disruption. 
Four think-tanks and associations sounded the alarm in May, warning the area could succumb to ""Detroit Syndrome"". They noted, though, that Airbus - flush with orders with rival Boeing (N:BA) weakened by the grounding of its 737 MAX - had avoided the kinds of strategic mistakes that worsened the plight of U.S. automakers.
Just as Toulouse is now in France, Detroit was once one of the wealthiest American cities. But after decades of job cuts and auto factory closures, the Midwest city's population of below 700,000 is less than half its 1950 peak, and many residents live in poverty. 
""Right now, aerospace sub-contracting represents 86,000 jobs in Occitanie and Airbus buys 5-billion-euros of parts locally,"" said Alain Di Crescenzo, president of Occitanie's Industrial Chamber of Commerce (CCI). Planemakers employ another 30,000.
""When Airbus coughs, everyone gets sick,"" he said.
CCI estimates Airbus will halve parts procurement this year. For suppliers paying off loans, such cuts could be devastating.
""Halving activity equates to 40,000 direct jobs locally and the same again for indirect jobs,"" Di Crescenzo said.
Airbus declined comment.
'COLLECTIVE BLINDNESS'
Furthermore, it's crunch time for employers. 
As France returns to some measure of normality after lockdowns, government-supported furlough schemes will begin expiring and charges on employers that have been waived could start rising from July.
""That's when the Detroit effect could kick in. If we don't do anything we could kill the largest aerospace cluster in Europe,"" Di Crescenzo said.
Toulouse's aviation roots date back to World War I when local industrialist Pierre-Georges Latecoere won a contract to build Salmson reconnaissance biplanes for the French army.
The city pioneered international flights with Latecoere's legendary Aeropostale airline and spawned the Caravelle, Concorde and the Airbus jets that now drive its economy.
But the recent think-tank report by Fondation Copernic, Attac, Amis du Monde diplomatique and Universite Populaire de Toulouse attacked ""collective blindness"" that left it dependent on a single sector - one now facing its worst-ever crisis
According to France's INSEE statistics office, French output shrank 33% in the first weeks of the crisis, but the Toulouse area plunged by 38% due to its reliance on aerospace. 
The shock was all the more painful because the industry had record activity in 2019, said regional director Caroline Jamet.
The dominant role of a handful of manufacturers like Airbus means three out of 10 local suppliers rely on one main client.
The city's mayor, conservative Jean-Luc Moudenc, is worried about such disarray in the short term. But, pitching himself as an aerospace champion in upcoming elections, he dismisses fears that the city of half a million faces Detroit-style decay.
Its factories hope to develop green aircraft of the future, he told Reuters, adding: ""Our firms have such know-how that they can diversify into other areas: defence, medicine or energy.""

496,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 08, 2020 01:09AM ET</span>",Airbus’s Global Footprint Becomes a Burden in a Shrinking Market,"(Bloomberg) -- Over the past dozen years, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) has grown from a European planemaker with purely local production into a global manufacturer with assembly lines on three continents that give it more clout to win orders around the world.
But as the aviation industry enters its most dramatic downturn ever, the company is finding that broad reach turning from an asset into a burden.
Senior management came together on a conference call on June 5 to discuss their response to the crisis, people familiar with the discussion said. Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury had already warned that Airbus must act to cut staff because it’s bleeding cash. Highlighting the urgency, the planemaker garnered zero new orders and just 24 aircraft deliveries for the month of May.
Airbus already cut production targets, adapting to the new reality in the immediate aftermath of a global travel lockdown that started in mid-March. But with airlines warning that a recovery won’t be imminent, manufacturers face the tough question of whether deeper cuts are needed, and where the ax should fall first.
“They’ve got to decide what size of production system they want to meet that new level of demand,” said Sash Tusa, an analyst at Agency Partners LLC in London. “The big issue there is going to be, can Airbus afford the luxury of having production in five different countries.”
Chinese Demand
When Airbus set up shop in China in 2008, the final assembly line in the city of Tianjin marked a shrewd strategic move because it widened the local appeal of its popular A320 model. The market now represents nearly a quarter of its commercial aircraft deliveries.
Creating a beachhead in Asia was “possibly the greatest decision Airbus has ever made in terms of market entrance,” Tusa said.
The manufacturer similarly turned its U.S. facility in Mobile, Alabama, into an A320 line after American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. placed a major order. The smaller A220, acquired from Canada’s Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc., is now being made at the site as well.
Airbus said in April that it had no plans to exit either its A220 location in Canada or the Alabama assembly line, which officially opened this month. The U.S. presence allows it to sell to American customers without the tariffs imposed on European aircraft in an ongoing trade spat.

Higher Costs
But maintaining that global network is costly. Parts are shipped from locations across Europe, like wings from the U.K. or fuselage sections from France and Germany. Its a finely tuned global mechanism that sets Airbus apart from rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co., which has its assembly lines more locally grouped in the U.S.
Airbus has already taken action to cut costs, ending its E-Fan X project for hybrid electric aircraft with Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY), pausing a plan to add another final assembly line at its Toulouse, France, headquarters campus and cutting back on capital spending. Yet the company may be forced to cut production more to reflect the drop in demand -- meaning cash flow could ebb further, forcing a harsher approach to staffing levels.
The powerful Airbus labor unions will gather this week to discuss proposals by management, people familiar with the matter have said.
An Airbus spokesman said the company is studying additional measures to mitigate the impact of the crisis in cooperation with its social partners, but that no final decision has been made.
Airbus’s production remains firmly rooted in western Europe. Wings come from the U.K,, the headquarters and its biggest assembly lines are in Toulouse, and the factory in Hamburg, Germany, cranks out most of the A320 aircraft. It also fits out interiors on many of the other, larger models. Components fly back and forth by cargo aircraft and are transported by barge and on trucks.
Key Stakeholders
Initially set up decades ago as a consortium of European firms to compete with the U.S., Airbus still faces pressure to evenly distribute work between its home nations, not the least because Germany and France are its two biggest shareholders.
George Hamlin, an aerospace consultant with more than 40 years of experience in the industry, worked at Airbus back when it was still an economic partnership, from 1989 to 1996. In those days, the company’s structure determined everything from how much sales staff were paid to who got certain roles and where work was assigned, he said.
“When there was a new program, for example with the A320, there was a very conscious effort to divide it up so the British would get 20% of the program and the French and Germans would get their 30% each,” Hamlin said. “This was a little puzzling. Coming up in a U.S. business environment, there simply wasn’t anything like that.”
While the company has changed considerably, there is still some pressure to spread the pain evenly across all of the European nations where it operates. The decision to pause plans for the A321 assembly line in Toulouse, just as the site loses work on wide-bodies, is likely to meet opposition from French unions who fear a shift toward Germany.
Airbus could be constrained in how many jobs it can cut in each nation. France and Germany have stepped in during the crisis to prop up their biggest airlines, and France is poised to unveil a rescue package this week for its aerospace industry.
Scaling back in any of these locations also looks challenging, as the company would be left with the same level of fixed costs but with fewer aircraft being produced. Airbus has always maintained it doesn’t add too much to its cost structure to have final assembly lines in different locations, but the economics may no longer stand up if it slashes production at a certain site.
Max Crisis
“The downside of having locations over different continents is obviously the cash,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst Benjamin Heelan. “Airbus’s commercial business through the cycle hasn’t been as cash-generative as Boeing’s. It’s just a lot more onerous from a manufacturing and inventory perspective managing supply chains in three different continents.”
Boeing faces its own challenges, with the return to service of its 737 Max following two fatal crashes still unresolved. But the U.S. company could end up in a stronger cash position in the short term, after the company announced plans to cut around 16,000 jobs.
Engine makers Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON:RR),  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.’s aviation unit have also announced they plan to let go of a combined 24,000 workers, and airlines around the world are under pressure to cut costs after the likes of  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY), among the biggest Airbus biggest customers, got state-sponsored bailouts.
Airbus may have no choice but to make some tough decisions. It burned through 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) in the first quarter, including a huge fine to settle a bribery investigation, and Faury, the CEO, has cautioned that furloughs and production cuts already announced could be just the start.
“Airbus at the trough will be less profitable than Boeing because it can cut less than Boeing,” said Tusa. Should the company decide to abandon some sites that it built up over the years, it would give “us a really important signal about how they feel about the industry going forward, and it won’t be a positive one.”

Wanjia Asset, China Asset Management, China Merchants Fund, China Universal Asset Management and Fullgoal Fund, five of the first six funds which are allowed to invest in the country's board for small and medium-sized enterprises, published their prospectuses on Saturday and will offer units of their funds on June 10.
According to their prospectuses, the investments in the board will be restricted to the so-called ""select tier"", a tier which requires highest standards in the board in terms of corporate governance, market capitalisation and profitability.
Lin Sishan, an analyst with Central China Securities, said mutual fund participation would improve liquidity.
Other analysts said it could also boost trading activity and pricing efficiency.
The fundraising to support the New Third Board, a lesser known part of China's capital markets, comes as Beijing looks to help bolster the financing channel for its companies amid Sino-U.S. frictions.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have spiked, as Trump administration has complained about China's early handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its tightening grip of Hong Kong via a new security legislation
Against the backdrop of tensions, the decisive factor is China's own reforms in its capital markets, said Pei Guilin, CEO of a Jiangsu-based asset manager.
Beijing is stepping up plans for a new ""mini-IPO"" market to help the country's army of small companies access capital quickly, as it keeps growing the next generation of innovative companies.
So far this year, the New Third Board index <.CSI899001> has gained about 8% to a near two-year high, compared with a 3.6% loss for the benchmark Shanghai index (SSEC).

Global airlines have taken a huge blow as curbs imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus led to a plunge in travel demand, leading to a liquidity crisis at firms. Singapore Airlines' total financing is among the biggest raised by any carrier amid the global health crisis.
Singapore Airlines said it had raised S$900 million through loans on some of its aircraft. It had also arranged new lines of credit and a short-term loan with several banks for further liquidity of more than S$500 million. 
""During this period of high uncertainty, SIA will continue to explore additional means to shore up liquidity as necessary,"" the company said in a statement.
On June 5, the company raised about S$8.8 billion through a rights issue, which was backed by existing shareholder Temasek Holdings (TEM.UL).
Singapore Airlines added that the maturity dates for some of its debts had been extended to 2021 or later, ensuring an available liquidity of more than S$1.7 billion. 
The company also has the option to raise up to a further S$6.2 billion in additional mandatory convertible bonds until up to July 2021.

TheCityUK said that by the end of March 2021, companies might be struggling to meet the financing costs of up to 36 billion pounds ($45.66 billion) of debt under the COVID-19 credit schemes that carry government guarantees for banks lending to firms.
That was on top of about 60 billion to 70 billion pounds of existing debt that was also likely to be straining borrowers.
The sectors most exposed were property, accommodation and food services and construction, with small and medium-sized firms accounting for about half the total, TheCityUK said.
""Lifting the debt burden from the shoulders of otherwise viable businesses will be essential to supporting a robust and sustainable economic recovery,"" Miles Celic, the group's chief executive, said in a statement.
""However, this is a huge and complicated challenge. It is already clear that there won’t be a one-size-fits-all solution.""
Private-sector capital could help plug the expected equity shortfall with options including an enhanced role for private equity and the unlocking of investment from British insurers and pension funds. But gaps might remain for the public sector.
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who previously warned of the possible need for a state role to help companies cope with their higher borrowing, said the COVID-19 pandemic would leave many firms in need of recapitalisation.

""How successful this recapitalisation is will have a major impact on the sustainability and effectiveness of the economic recovery – and, therefore, the number of jobs the economy can support,"" he said on Twitter.

The plan, aimed at helping the sector recover from the fallout of the novel coronavirus pandemic that has slashed air travel, will comprise various measures including loan guarantees and support for research and development, Les Echos said.
France's economy ministry declined to comment.
The country's transport minister said earlier on Sunday that France was seeking to create a 1 billion euro fund as part of the crisis package.
That was in line with the amount cited last week by sources familiar with the proposals, who told Reuters that government and industry officials were negotiating a privately led investment fund to help small aerospace suppliers.
""For one of the funds, that is more or less the target,"" the minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, told the news channel LCI when asked if 1 billion euros was an amount being envisaged.
He did not specify what that fund would cover or how much other funds might be worth, adding that the aerospace initiative would be presented this week.
Les Echos, like other French media, said the plan was due to be unveiled on Tuesday.
Djebbari said the plan would notably seek to protect aerospace firms from foreign takeovers, citing interest from Chinese firms that ""are making offers at a time when they (French firms) are in difficulty"".
As with multibillion-euro support already unveiled for the car industry, France would seek job guarantees, Djebbari said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) has approached U.S. rival  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) about a possible merger that would form one the world's largest drug companies, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Any deal would unite two of the companies at the forefront of the industry's efforts to fight the new coronavirus and could be politically sensitive as governments seek control over potential vaccines or treatments.
AstraZeneca contacted Gilead last month, but the U.S. firm was not interested in combining with another big pharmaceutical company, the Bloomberg report https://bloom.bg/3h2GU9e said. 
A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. 
Gilead, the world's largest maker of HIV drugs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If combined, the two companies would have a market capitalization of about $232 billion, based on Friday's closing stock levels.
That would exceed  Merck & Co  (N:MRK) and  Pfizer  (N:PFE) at $207 billion and $200 billion respectively.
Two sources familiar with AstraZeneca's thinking questioned the rationale of a tie-up, telling Reuters Gilead's remdesivir for COVID-19 patients was insufficient to justify pursuing a multi-billion deal that would detract from AstraZeneca's work on a coronavirus vaccine.
One of the sources questioned the timing. Given the potential impact a successful vaccine would have on AstraZeneca's share price, it does not need the additional strain of pursuing a record-breaking deal, especially when travel constraints make face-to-face meetings difficult.
AstraZeneca's top-selling product is its lung cancer drug Tagrisso, which generated revenues of $982 million in the first quarter. 
Gilead's biggest blockbuster is HIV drug Biktarvy, with sales of $1.69 billion in the first quarter. 
Gilead, AstraZeneca and other drugmakers, including Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY), Pfizer Inc (N:PFE) and Merck & Co Inc (N:MRK), are racing to develop vaccines or treatments for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
More than 6.90 million people have been reported infected with the coronavirus globally and 399,025 have died, a Reuters tally showed on Sunday. 
It is unclear whether a vaccine will work, but AstraZeneca's partnership with Oxford University to develop one is among a handful of initiatives U.S. President Donald Trump's COVID task force has backed.
Gilead has also been in the vanguard of COVID-19 treatments.
Its remdesivir antiviral is the first drug to lead to improvement in COVID-19 patients in formal clinical trials. 
The drug has been cleared for emergency use in COVID-19 patients in countries including the United States and South Korea and could bring in more than $7 billion in annual sales for Gilead by 2022 if governments seek to stockpile it against future outbreaks, SVB Leerink has estimated.

With planes around the world grounded since late March, airlines had hoped to start flying from July, but bosses say quarantine measures will hamper that recovery.
From June 8, almost everyone arriving in Britain will be required to self-isolate for 14 days and to fill in a contact form with details of their accommodation.
Describing itself as a ""pre-action protocol letter,"" meaning it could be followed by legal action, the letter from British Airways, Ryanair (I:RYA) and easyJet (L:EZJ) said the government had failed to justify the blanket nature of the regulations.
""The effect is to establish a wholly unjustified and disproportionate restriction on individuals traveling to England (and questionably the United Kingdom) and will inevitably mean that there is very little increase in the numbers of persons leaving and entering the country,"" the letter said.
Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA owner IAG (L:ICAG) said on Friday the industry had not been consulted and the company was considering a legal challenge.
The government has said the new regime will be in place across Britain, although enforcement measures will be set individually by each of the devolved nations. In England, a breach of rules will be punishable with a 1,000 pounds ($1,266) fine.
The airlines say the quarantine measures are more stringent than those imposed on people suspected of being or confirmed to be infected by the novel coronavirus who are asked to isolate and do not face criminal sanctions.
Their letter also said it was ""illogical and irrational"" to impose quarantine on people arriving from European Union countries that have lower infection rates than Britain.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Gulf carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways are extending the period of reduced pay for their staff until September as they try to preserve cash during the global coronavirus pandemic. 
The aviation industry has been among the worst hit by the outbreak, which has dented travel demand and forced major airlines to lay off staff and seek government bailouts.
State airlines Emirates and Etihad have operated limited, mostly outbound services from the United Arab Emirates since grounding passenger flights in March.
They are due to restart some connecting flights this month after the UAE last week lifted a suspension on services where passengers stop off in the country to change planes, or for refuelling.
Dubai's Emirates told employees on Sunday it would extend a three month wage cut due to end this month until September 30, according to an internal email seen by Reuters. 
In some cases, pay cuts will also be deepened, with some basic salaries reduced by 50%, the email to Emirates Group employees said. 
The decision was made after reviewing all possible options to preserve its cash position, it said.
State-owned Emirates Group, which employed 105,000 as of March and includes the airline among its assets, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Emirates had previously reduced basic wages reduced by 25% to 50% for three months from April, with junior employees exempted.
Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways has extended its salary cuts of between 25% to 50% to September, a spokeswoman said, as it considers all options to protect jobs and preserve cash.
The airline originally reduced salaries for the month of April.
Etihad last week laid off some cabin crew and its not planning any further crew redundancies, according to emails seen by Reuters. 
The spokeswoman said there have been redundancies across several areas of the airline, and last month sources told Reuters Etihad was planning to lay off 1,200 employees.

Like other airlines, Emirates and Etihad have laid off staff due to the impact of its business. Fellow Gulf carrier Qatar Airways has said it could lay off up to 20% of its employees.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The Australian government said on Sunday it will continue to underwrite domestic flights through September, extending its aid for airlines such as Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd's (AX:VAH) hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Michael McCormack said the initial backing, due to expire on Monday, will be extended to cover shortfalls in operating flights on top domestic routes, even as airlines start to rebuild crushed capacity. 
Australia has barred its citizens from almost all outbound travel in order to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. 
""The Australian government is doing everything possible to ensure the aviation industry is sustained throughout the pandemic so that it can rebound on the other side,"" McCormack said in a statement.
With border closures and social distancing since March, Australia has avoided the high infections and casualties of many nations, reporting 102 deaths and 7,255 infections so far.
Qantas has grounded 220 planes and halted all international flights, except government repatriation charters and cargo flights. 
On Thursday, Qantas said it would triple domestic capacity to 15% of normal levels by the end of the month, with the potential to rise to 40% in July if state border restrictions ease. 
Virgin became the country's first big coronavirus-related collapse, entering administration in April. It is for sale, and binding offers are due on Friday. 
McCormack would not say how much the extended assistance would cost but said the government's backing for the industry has exceeded AUD1.2 billion ($840 million).
The government will also extend financial support for regional airlines to ensure regional continue to receive essential air services from Sept. 30 to Dec. 31, he said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's new government would not be willing to accept even compensation of $3 billion from Goldman Sachs in a settlement over the 1MDB scandal, the finance minister told Reuters, ruling out a figure that is far higher than the bank offered last year.
The Southeast Asian nation has charged Goldman Sachs and 17 current and former directors of its units for allegedly misleading investors over bond sales totalling $6.5 billion that the U.S. bank helped raise for sovereign wealth fund 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Bhd).
Finance Minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz, who joined the three-month-old government from the corporate world, said he had held a conversation with  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) representatives last month.
""We are continuing our pursuit to get some money from GS. And the legal case is still ongoing, so we will have to wait for the outcome of that,"" the minister said in an interview in his office in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday.
""If it's $2 billion, I can say, no. $3 billion, no,"" he added. ""As long the amount is not something we think we can accept, then we continue with the legal case."" 
He declined to say what an acceptable sum would be.
Edward Naylor, Goldman Sachs's Asia head of corporate communications, declined to comment.
Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said in December that Goldman Sachs had offered ""one point something billion"" dollars for an out-of-court settlement over it role in the scandal at 1MDB.

According to the U.S. Justice Department, Goldman Sachs earned $600 million in fees for its work with 1MDB.

The issue was recently discussed at an internal event, the spokesman said, when asked about a report in industry magazine Automobilwoche.
""There were general deliberations about what further cost measures could be taken to respond to the pandemic,"" the spokesman told Reuters. ""There are no concrete decisions yet.""
Automobilwoche quoted Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess as telling top managers at a meeting on Thursday: ""We must significantly cut R&D expenditure, investments and fixed costs compared with the previous planning."" 
The group's net liquidity would ""continue to decline at least until July due to weak demand"", the magazine, citing participants at the event, quoted Diess as saying, adding that not all group brands would achieve a positive result in 2020.

This meant the main VW passenger car brand must reduce its so-called material overheads by 20%, the magazine said.

513,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 06, 2020 03:08AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: Social Media Bulls Vs. Bears,"By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan
Investing.com - Social media companies were further under the presidential microscope this week.
The intersection between politics and responsibility arrived (ironically is too easy and misused here) when Twitter announced it would fact check some tweets form the White House.
Snapchat owner Snap (NYSE:SNAP) also announced a measure against the administration’s content.
Is now a good time to go for social medial stocks?
Yasin Ebrahim argues that stocks in the crosshairs of the president and under the microscope of regulators are best left alone during this rally.
Kim Khan contends that the market is going up, with or without these stocks, and also that the White House is impotent to really impact them.
Both authors agreed President Donald Trump may create his own platform, win or lose, called Trumpeter. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bear Case
In the last few weeks, Trump has waged war on social media companies, with Twitter, in particular, drawing much of the president's ire for fact-checking his tweets.
Trump hit back with an executive order to target the legal protection - section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - that shields social media companies from lawsuits over the content posted on their platforms.
""Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen. ""
The law, which has stood for over quarter of century, is unlikely to get overturned as it requires Congressional approval.
A victory for Trump would ramp up monitoring, compliance, and legal expenses for social media companies, but the costs would likely be immaterial, RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney said.
Yet, the attack on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) does sharpen the lens of regulation on bigger players such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google.
Facebook and Google are themselves are on trial over privacy and antitrust violations respectively. That could result in significant implications for the industry at a time when whispers of breaking up big tech are circulating, once gain.
The U.S. state attorneys general investigating Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google for potential antitrust violations are looking to push for the breakup of its ad technology business, CNBC reported on Friday, citing sources.
In March, Morningstar predicted that excessive fines and stifling regulations could hurt the value of Google and Facebook by as much as 15% and 11% respectively.
While social media companies have not seen investors hit the brakes just yet, the next few weeks, and months could be fraught with uncertainty.
A Congressional report on big tech expected to be released later this month and the upcoming November election could set the stage for a summer 'techlash' that will see social media companies on trial.
The Bull Case
Friday’s trading session is an opportune moment to argue the case for social media stocks. The Nasdaq's record intraday high did a more eloquent job than I could, despite the late decline.
Laugh at the “rising tide lifting all boats” cliché, but respect the Federal Reserve’s ability to push the major indexes up to where they were before the Covid-19 lockdowns is clear.
Twitter closed 3% higher, Facebook finished the day 2% up and Snap ended up 5.6%.
But let’s not ignore the cloud of government regulation hovering over those stocks. Trump’s vow to remove the Article 230 provision, where social media companies can be held liable for content on their platforms.
That’s been happening since last year. Is there any reason to think that the president will be more effective?
Breaking down the major public social media companies, only Twitter stands out.
If you were bullish on Snap before, you should be bullish on Snap again.
As soon as the company decided it would not promote the president’s tweets, Trump threw accusations that the company acted “illegally” to rig the “2020 election”
But the administration has supplied no more on the subject.
If you’re long SNAP, watch Kylie Jenner still, not the White House.
Moving on to Facebook, that’s another easy one to be bullish. CEO Mark Zuckerberg bends with the wind. He never met a controversy he couldn’t avoid and he called Trump to give the president support.
Any new legislation will favor Facebook.
That leaves Twitter, which decided to do to the president slightly less than it does to those who violate its terms of service.
Investors should agree the Twitter is adjusting to market forces. So many companies have now said they support the recent protests.
Fox CEO Lachlain Murdoch, no less, had this to say to his employees:
“This is time to the time for people to come together in their grief, work to heal, and coalesce to address”.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 06, 2020 12:05AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Bond investors look for Fed to justify steepening yield curve,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Expectations that the global economy has dodged the worst-case coronavirus pandemic scenarios have led to a dramatic sell-off in U.S. government bonds from their record highs, pushing the yield curve to its steepest level since March. 
Investors will get a chance next week to see whether the U.S. Federal Reserve agrees with their optimism. The U.S. central bank's two-day meeting, ending on Wednesday, will be the first since April when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy could feel the weight of the economic shutdown for more than a year. 
The meeting will follow a surprise gain in the Labor Department's closely watched jobs report on Friday that pushed benchmark 10-year Treasury yields to the highest since early March.
""The sell-off in the bond market in the last few weeks seems to be justified,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY).
While the Fed could introduce additional bond-buying programs known as quantitative easing or yield-curve control measures to target short-term rates, fund managers say they expect yields will need to rise significantly to justify any intervention in the bulk of the curve. Instead, they are watching for hints that the central bank believes the worst part of the coronavirus crisis has passed.
""They are really in this transition phase,"" said Eric Stein, co-director of global income and portfolio manager at  Eaton Vance  (NYSE:EV). ""Markets are functioning, if not all the way back to pre-shock levels, with very strong debt issuance and market improvement, even though the real economy is incredibly weak.""
As a result, Stein is looking for signs that the Fed believes the economic rebound can support the rise in yields. 
""The Fed will be OK with a slow creep higher, particularly with a backdrop of a recovery, but if it moves too much and destabilizes the recovery, there's a reason for concern,"" he said.
Ed Al-Hussainy, senior interest rate analyst at Columbia Threadneedle, expects the Fed to focus on its newly announced Main Street Lending Program to support small- and medium-sized businesses facing financial strain from the pandemic, rather than introducing significant new stimulus measures.
""The Fed is likely to communicate that there is more scope for fiscal measures but that is a very uncomfortable spot to be in,"" he said. ""We won't have a clear sense of direction of the economy until well into the fourth quarter because all the sequential data now is massively positive."" 
The manufacturing ISM index rose to 43.1 in May from 41.5 in April, while weekly jobless claims fell to 1.877 million from 2.126 million the week before. 
""Recent economic reports in the U.S. have been uniformly weak, though not any worse than expected,"" said Kevin Cummins (NYSE:CMI),senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. 
Eddy Vataru, lead portfolio manager at Osterweis Capital Management, said the larger risk for the Fed is that rates remain too low, making it unlikely that there will be a significant push for yield curve-control measures. 
""We can now discredit the worst outcomes of the virus. The sentiment around the risks around the virus have really changed,"" he said, pointing to declining infection and fatality rates in coronavirus hot spots such as the New York City region. 
As a result, he is moving into corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities and shying away from Treasuries, which he said have ""no investment value"" at their current yields. 

""At the end of the day, we have a ton of stimulus, both fiscal and monetary, and the markets have reacted to it,"" he said.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Buyout firm Sycamore Partners in talks to buy J.C. Penney - sources,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Sycamore Partners is in preliminary talks to acquire J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) out of bankruptcy should the U.S. department store chain's negotiations with its creditors fail, three people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
J.C. Penney, which employs roughly 85,000 people, filed for bankruptcy protection in May after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to temporarily close its more than 800 stores across the United States, compounding financial woes that stemmed from years of dwindling sales. 
Sycamore is weighing acquiring J.C. Penney outright or making an investment in the troubled retailer, the sources said.
There is no certainty that the talks between Sycamore and J.C. Penney will result in a deal, which would require a bankruptcy judge's approval, the sources said.
J.C. Penney is also in touch with some of its landlords, including  Brookfield Asset Management  Inc (TO:BAMa) and Simon Property Group (N:SPG), about possible transactions, the sources said. Under one scenario being explored, Sycamore, Brookfield and Simon would join forces on a bid for J.C. Penney, two of the sources said.  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) is also involved in the discussions, one of the sources said. 
J.C. Penney shares surged 47% after Reuters reported on the talks, ending the day up 55% to close at 32 cents. 
The sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential. Sycamore and J.C. Penney declined to comment. Brookfield had no immediate comment while Simon and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
J.C. Penney is in discussions about handing over control to its lenders in exchange for reducing its nearly $5 billion of debt. This hinges on a slew of investment firms that hold the company's senior debt and have provided the company's bankruptcy financing agreeing to J.C. Penney's business plan by July 14.
If the Plano, Texas-based company does not persuade enough lenders to approve its plan by the following day, July 15, the terms of its bankruptcy loan require J.C. Penney to abandon its reorganization efforts and pursue a sale.
It is unclear how much Sycamore is willing to pay for J.C. Penney, which is in the process of permanently closing stores and cutting jobs.
Sycamore, a New York private equity firm that specializes in retail and consumer investments, has in the past taken control of high-profile businesses such as office supplies chain Staples, women's clothing retailer Talbots and department-store operator Belk.
Last month, Sycamore walked away from a $525 million deal to buy a majority stake in L Brands Inc's (N:LB) Victoria's Secret, as the pandemic hammered sales at the lingerie chain.
Brookfield and Simon operate malls across the United States. Brookfield in May said it would devote $5 billion to non-controlling investments designed to revitalize retailers struggling in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
During a court hearing on Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones approved fresh financing from senior lenders to aid J.C. Penney's operations while it navigates Chapter 11 protection, and expressed concern the 118-year old chain needed to restructure quickly to survive.
In July, the lenders will ""decide whether the dream lives or the dream dies,"" said Cathy Hershcopf, a creditors' lawyer, during the hearing.
David Kurtz, a  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) banker representing J.C. Penney, said during the hearing that ""four major institutions"" had signed confidentiality agreements to discuss working with the company and its lenders on the retailer's restructuring. He did not name them.
Sycamore, Brookfield, Simon and Wells Fargo are the four unnamed parties, one of the sources said.
Under a plan being discussed with its creditors, J.C. Penney would be split into two companies. One would be a real estate investment trust that would hold some of the company's property and lease it back to J.C. Penney. The other would operate J.C. Penney's retail business. 
Joshua Sussberg, a Kirkland & Ellis LLP lawyer representing J.C. Penney, said during Thursday's court hearing that the company needed to persuade lenders negotiating to take control of the restructured business to keep it alive and that he planned to hold them accountable for how the case ended. 
Even in less-fraught times, many retailers, including Barneys New York Inc and Toys 'R' Us, have failed to reorganize under bankruptcy protection and gone out of business for good.
J.C. Penney on Thursday said it plans to permanently close 154 stores, and may shut more. It has so far reopened nearly 500 stores that were closed due to the pandemic, and plans to bring additional locations online in coming weeks. Still, concerns remain that customers might be slow to return amid health concerns and job losses not seen since the Great Depression.

J.C. Penney is also seeking permission from landlords to skip rent payments for June, July and August, Sussberg said last week.

PG&E's debt financing package, which will consist of high-yield bonds and term loans, is part of the company's previously announced plans to raise up to $27 billion in funding from future public offerings, said George Schultze, founder of Schultze Asset Management, which invests in distressed securities. 
Schultze's company is serving as one of the participants in the company's financing plan, which is crucial to PG&E's goal of exiting bankruptcy by June 30 in order to tap a state-backed fund that would help power utilities cushion the hit from wildfires.
""While the company comes out of this slightly overleveraged, it has a strong business and will be able to pay down the debt,"" Schultze said. ""The debt market is so hot right now that I'm sure this offering will be oversubscribed.""
Most of the remaining $16 billion in proposed future public offerings will be from equity raised - possibly at a discount to where PG&E's peer group is trading at the time of emergence from bankruptcy, Schultze said.
Bloomberg first reported on the debt financing plans on Friday.
PG&E said it was working diligently to obtain approval for its reorganization plan by the bankruptcy court as soon as possible.
Last month, PG&E's Chapter 11 plan was confirmed by the California Public Utilities Commission, bringing the troubled utility a step closer to emerge from bankruptcy and participate in a state-backed wildfire fund.
The regulator had also approved PG&E's request to issue new debt and securities to finance its exit from bankruptcy.

PG&E filed for bankruptcy in January last year, citing potential liabilities exceeding $30 billion from major wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018.

Investing.com – The Nasdaq surged Friday after hitting an intraday all-time high, as unexpected job gains raised hopes for an economic comeback and prompted investors to raise their bets on big tech.
The Nasdaq Composite surged 2.25% to a record high intraday, closing just below its previous all-time high close of 9,817.18 on Feb. 19. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.15%, or 829 points, and the S&P 500 gained 2.62%.
The U.S. economy generated 2.51 million jobs in May, confounding expectations for a loss of 8 million jobs. The unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 13.3% in May from 14.7% a month earlier.
Most of the job gains came from sectors that had ""experienced the largest declines in March and April: leisure & hospitality, personal services, retail and construction,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. ""This is perfectly consistent with the reopening of the economy, which began in late April/early May,"" it added.
The gains for the tech-heavy Nasdaq was helped by a record close for Apple (NaaASDAQ:AAPL), up 2.8%, as data showed the tech giant's push into services - to offset its dependence on iPhone revenue - is gaining traction.  
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) lifted its price target on Apple to $295 from $260, citing ongoing app store momentum in May.  Despite a slow start, ""stay at home"" measures are now translating into a rapid acceleration in App Store revenue, which is up 39% year-on-year in May, the bank said, citing Sensor Tower data.

McKelvey's exit comes at a time when the company's core business faces an existential threat as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced its clients to stay away from WeWork offices, weighing heavily on its occupancy rates.
""After 10 years, I've made one of the most difficult decisions of my life ... at the end of this month, I'll be leaving WeWork,"" said McKelvey through a company spokesman. 
SoftBank-controlled WeWork is currently in the middle of executing a five-year turnaround plan and is shaking up its top management ranks under Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure. 
Under Claure, who is also a SoftBank executive, WeWork has brought in several executives including CEO Sandeep Mathrani. A number of top executives who were part of the old guard at WeWork under Neumann, including co-CEOs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham, have also left the company.
The office-sharing startup has gone through a tumultuous period since abandoning its initial public offering in September. It was forced to push out Neumann last year after SoftBank and other shareholders turned on him over his management style, his numerous conflicts of interest and his handling of the IPO.
SoftBank is also embroiled in a legal dispute with a special committee on WeWork's board comprising two board members, Bruce Dunlevie and Lew Frankfort, after the Japanese company backed out of a $3-billion tender offer that was part of its bailout package for the startup. 
The WeWork board last week appointed another special committee comprising new board members Alex Dimitrief and Frederick Arnold to decide on the validity of the previous special committee.

To date, SoftBank has invested more than $13.5 billion in WeWork.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Friday, and the Nasdaq was on course to set a new record closing high after the May jobs provided an astounding upside surprise and the clearest evidence yet that the U.S. economy is bouncing back sooner than expected from pandemic-related lockdowns.
The Nasdaq is set to be the first among the three major U.S. stock indexes to reclaim all-time highs reached in February. The S&P 500 and the Dow are now within 6% and 8% of overtaking their record closing levels.
The benchmark S&P 500 is now within one percent of showing a year-to-date gain.
The U.S. economy added a remarkable 2.5 million jobs last month, rebounding from April's record 20.7 million payrolls drop and pushing the unemployment rate down to 13.3%. Analysts saw unemployment soaring to a historic 19.8%.
""I don't think anybody anticipated this,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors in Boston.
""It has confirmed what many folks were suggesting - that the effects on the labor market from the pandemic were temporary and that when the economy reopened and the infection rates started to diminish, that these jobs would come back.""
""This report confirms that.""
U.S. Treasury yields rose on the jobs data, giving a boost to interest rate-sensitive banks and sending the S&P 500 Banks index up 5.5%.
Airlines, among the hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis, soared, with the ARCA Airlines index jumping 8.5%.
But the World Health Organization warned that the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought the global economy to its knees in the wake of mandated shutdowns, is far from over and new cases are on the rise.
Market participants now turn their focus to the U.S. Federal Reserve, at whose monetary policy meeting next week the latest jobs data will almost certainly be discussed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 891.6 points, or 3.39%, to 27,173.42, the S&P 500 gained 87.41 points, or 2.81%, to 3,199.76 and the Nasdaq Composite added 207.37 points, or 2.16%, to 9,823.18.
All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 were in the black, with energy, financials and industrials leading the gainers in a continuation of a rotation into cyclicals, which were beaten up amid economic lockdowns.
Small caps and transportation stocks also outperformed, with the Russell 2000 and Dow Transportation up 4.7% and 3.9%, respectively.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co surged 12.2%, giving biggest the blue-chip Dow its biggest boost, on hopes of a pickup in air travel a day after American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and United Airlines said they would boost their U.S. flight schedule next month.
Shares of luxury retailer Tiffany & Co jumped 5.5% after Reuters reported LVMH's $16.2-billion takeover deal was back on track.
Drugmaker  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc advanced 2.8% after announcing it would receive up to $60 million from the U.S. Department of Defense to manufacture its COVID-19 vaccine candidate.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 6.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.70-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said Warren Buffett, often regarded as the world's greatest investor, made a mistake by recently exiting a multi-billion dollar investment in the airline industry.
Trump made his assessment at the White House, shortly after the U.S. Labor Department reported an unexpected surge in May jobs, and five weeks after Buffett said his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) sold its airline stakes.
""Warren Buffett sold airlines a little while ago,"" Trump said. ""He's been right his whole life, but sometimes even somebody like Warren Buffett -- I have a lot of respect for him -- they make mistakes. They should have kept the airline stocks because the airline stocks went through the roof today.""
Buffett did not immediately respond to a request for comment through his assistant.
At Berkshire's May 2 annual meeting, Buffett said his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate had in April sold its roughly $6 billion of stock in  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and United AIrlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL).
Buffett said the coronavirus pandemic had changed the industry ""in a very major way,"" through no fault of the carriers, leaving the future of flying ""much less clear.""
Many airline stocks have outpaced the broader market this week, as carriers took steps to restore some flights they had canceled because of the pandemic.
American, Delta, Southwest and United rose after the Labor Department said U.S. nonfarm payrolls grew by 2.51 million in May, and the jobless rate fell to 13.3% from April's 14.7%.
Economists on average expected a loss of 8 million jobs, and a 19.8% unemployment rate.
Berkshire's stock is lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX) for a second straight year.

Investors have faulted Buffett for not spending more of Berkshire's cash, which ended March at $137.3 billion.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union antitrust regulators want more power to investigate Chinese companies benefiting from state subsidies seeking to acquire EU firms because of the distortive effect of such aid, a person with familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
The move comes as officials worry about Chinese and other foreign companies acquiring European champions with cutting edge technologies, especially those weakened by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The European Commission, which can vet subsidies provided by EU governments but has no power over foreign state aid, has told EU countries that it wants to prepare the ground for a legal instrument to ensure a level playing field, the person said. 
EU competition enforcers want to look at all cases involving a foreign state-subsidised company and have the power to launch an investigation. That would include in both merger and non-merger cases. 
The planned legislation would complement the bloc's foreign investment screening tool adopted in April which allows EU countries to intervene in cases of foreign direct investment in strategic assets, in particular if carried out by state-controlled or state-financed enterprises.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager will present her proposal known as the white paper on foreign subsidies on June 17 and the new legislation would encompass the bloc's competition and trade policy.

PARIS (Reuters) - A stand-off over undelivered passenger jets is intensifying after Airbus (PA:AIR) signalled it would sue airlines refusing to honour contracts in the face of the coronavirus crisis.
The warning by Chief Executive Guillaume Faury in a news interview came as Airbus announced May deliveries well below normal, despite a partial recovery to 24 jets.
Planemakers and lessors have received multiple requests from airlines to delay deliveries due to the slump in air travel.
Faury told Politico that some airlines, which he did not identify, had refused to take calls at the height of the crisis, but that he hoped for a compromise.
""It will remain, I hope, the exception because we always try to find a different route than going to court,"" Faury said.
""But if and when airlines - and it's happening - have no other choice than fully defaulting and not proposing something better than nothing, or are not willing to do it, then (lawsuits) will happen.""
Industry sources said such public warnings are rare in the tight-knit aviation market and could backfire. 
But they noted the disruption is so great that Airbus is adopting a more aggressive stance, bracing itself for a repeat of turmoil such as the 2001 collapse of Swissair and Sabena.
It has sent out dozens of default notices to airlines in a step that can lead to lawsuits but undermine relations, the sources said. Some airlines have responded angrily in private.
DEFAULT NOTICES
Qatar Airways this week warned Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) to defer deliveries or face a loss of future business, without saying whether it had received any formal notices.
Default notices or formal warnings are more common than court cases in aviation but are usually issued sparingly, in part because they can trigger covenants in financing contracts.
In a deliberate signal to the aviation market last month, Airbus unusually placed six planes originally intended for AirAsia (KL:AIRA), which has halted taking jets, up for sale. Financial sources said no buyer had been found.
Airbus had no immediate comment.
Planemakers lifted output to record levels before the crisis, but there had already been signs that a prolonged boom was fading and that airlines were facing a glut of aircraft. 
Several financiers said that manufacturers, while justified in protecting positions ahead of further airline bankruptcies, also had themselves to blame for over-producing.
""Many observers already believed before the crisis that too many airplanes were produced for too many airlines that did not have the solid business model and financial strength to deliver the growth embedded in their order books,"" said Bertrand Grabowski, an aviation banker turned independent adviser.
""Trees do not grow to the sky and already the industry was at the end of its cycle,"" he added.
Even though some low-cost airlines are regularly taking aircraft for which they managed to raise financing before the crisis, financial sources say that window is expected to narrow soon as banks and lessors hesitate to provide new finance.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) is closing three out of four international bases for flight attendants, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, saying it is not able to sustain the bases in the current environment.
Airlines are bleeding cash as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated the aviation industry, with international flights hit especially hard by government travel restrictions and a lack of demand.
Chicago-based United is closing its Frankfurt, Hong Kong, and Tokyo bases effective Oct. 1, while keeping London, United's head of inflight services John Slater said in the Friday memo to crew.
About 840 flight attendants will be affected by the decision, a spokeswoman said, but will be able to transfer to U.S. bases for the October flying schedule, depending on their eligibility to work in the United States. 

United has received about $5 billion in government payroll aid under the CARES Act which bans any forced job cuts before October. It has rolled out voluntary early outs for staff including flight attendants in an effort to reduce its headcount and cut costs in the months ahead.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Munich prosecutors on Friday said they had searched Wirecard's (DE:WDIG) headquarters and opened proceedings against the payment company's entire management board as part of a market manipulation probe initiated by Germany's financial regulator BaFin.
Wirecard faces allegations including accounting irregularities and disclosure violations, which it denies. 
In a statement on Friday, prosecutors said the company was suspected of having issued misleading information which may have impacted Wirecard's share price between March 12 and April 22.
Wirecard confirmed in a statement that its premises had been searched as part of an investigation targeting its management board. It said it was cooperating fully with the investigation.
""The board is optimistic that this matter will be resolved and that the accusations will be shown not to be founded,"" the management board said in a statement.
BaFin has been investigating whether Wirecard withheld information or may have provided incorrect information before an independent audit of its earnings was concluded. 
Wirecard delayed the release of its results to June 18 after the audit by KPMG, published on April 28, failed to verify its financial reports. 
KPMG said it could not provide sufficient documentation to address all allegations of accounting irregularities, sending Wirecard's shares sharply lower.
Last week BaFin said it was investigating whether Chief Executive Markus Braun had violated insider-trading rules by buying stock during the quiet period before the publication of its annual report.

Wirecard, founded in 1999, has profited from a boom in online payments by acting both as an acquirer, handling payments to hundreds of thousands of merchants, and as an issuer of real and 'virtual' payment cards to consumers.

Wall Street has surged following a crash into bear territory in March as investors bet on a revival in business activity with the easing of a nationwide lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus.
Data on Friday showed a surprise rise in U.S. jobs in May, offering the clearest signal yet the downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic was probably over, although the road to recovery could still be long.
The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) is now less than 1% down on the year after crashing more than 32% from that level by late March, and is about 6% below its record high. The blue-chip Dow Jones index (DJI) is about 8% below its own all-time high.
The smaller Nasdaq 100 index (NDX) hit a record high on Thursday, partly powered by tech-related names including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Netflix Inc (O:NFLX), Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL).

Closing at a record high, according to a widely accepted definition, would confirm that the Nasdaq Composite has been in a new bull market since its pandemic low on March 23.

The European planemaker delivered 24 aircraft in May, up from 14 in April, but down 70% from 81 aircraft in May 2019.
Planemakers continue to be hit by depressed demand from cash-starved airlines, logistical problems in bringing in airline inspection teams and gaps in the supply chain caused by social-distancing measures to tackle the virus.
France, where Airbus is headquartered, eased coronavirus restrictions on June 2.
Last month's deliveries included six narrow-body aircraft to Indian budget airline IndiGo (NS:INGL) and one wide-body A350-1000 each to British Airways (L:ICAG) and Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways.
The figures bring total deliveries so far this year to 160 planes, down 49% from 313 in the same period of 2019.
Highlighting the impact of the crisis, Airbus sold no new aircraft in May.

So far this year it has sold 365 jets and received cancellations for 66, an improvement on the first five months of 2019 after a strong start to 2020 in the weeks before the spread of the new coronavirus sent the global economy into recession.

534,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>",Bonds falter as blazing stock rally lures investors,"By Ira Iosebashvili and Karen Brettell
(Reuters) - Improving U.S. economic data is pushing investors out of U.S. government bonds at the fastest pace in months, the latest sign that risk appetite is returning to broader markets. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury rose on Friday to 0.96%, their highest since March 20, after government data showed the economy unexpectedly added jobs in May after suffering record losses in the prior month. Those on the 30-year Treasury bond were recently at 1.76%, up from 1.40% a week ago. Bond yields rise when prices fall. 
The moves come amid signs that easing lockdowns across the United States and trillions in stimulus are helping stabilize the economy, potentially allaying concerns over a stock rally that has seemed disconnected from economic reality and weighing on Treasuries and other safe-haven assets. 
The S&P was recently up around 2.8%, and the index’s 39.3% gain between March 23 and June 3 marked its best 50-session period in history, according to LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA).
""There's been an ongoing debate for some time whether we're going to have a ""V"" or a ""U"" or an ""L""-shaped recovery from this,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. “Certainly this supports the ""V"" camp.""
Surveys have also shown consumer confidence, manufacturing and services industries stabilizing, albeit at low levels in May, indicating that the downturn triggered by a near shutdown of the country was bottoming. 
And while investors have rushed into investment grade and high-yield bonds, some have lightened their positions in Treasuries. 
Government bond fund outflows increased to $3.24 billion in the week to June 3 from $140 million in the prior week, while investors pulled some $37.5 billion out of money market funds, data from BofA Global Research showed. 
The sell-off in bonds “is primarily based on what is being viewed as an improvement in the economy,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial. “The long end of the curve is reflecting optimism around an economy that seems to have troughed and is getting better.”
U.S. investor sentiment has also turned more bullish in recent weeks despite a still-climbing death toll from the coronavirus pandemic and widespread civil unrest stemming from protests against racial inequality and excessive use of force by police. 
The percentage of individual investors describing their short-term outlook as “bearish” fell to its lowest in nearly four months, according to a survey by the American Association of Individual Investors.
“For a while, people have been talking about this (stock)rally as being flimsy or without staying power.” said Solomon Tadesse, head of quantitative equities strategy for North America at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), in an interview before the jobs data was released. Now “it’s like a sentiment change.”
Bond yields have also risen as the Treasury ramps up its sales of long-dated debt while the Federal Reserve reduces its bond purchases, leaving more bonds to be absorbed by investors.
To be sure, bond sell-offs have stalled or reversed in the past when economic data has stumbled - a profound risk this time around, as uncertainty remains about the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic as lockdowns end. 
“Yields can continue to push higher from here, but not dramatically so,” said Jon Hill, interest rate strategist, BMO Capital Markets. “At the end of the day we are in a recession, unemployment is above 10 percent, we have low inflationary pressure ... and a Fed quantitative easing program on top of everything else.” 
The Fed, which has pledged to do everything in its power to foster a recovery, may also turn to new tools in the months ahead, including yield caps to keep rates low and monetary conditions loose, investors said. 
John McIntyre, fixed income portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, expects the Fed may move to cap yields in September, though questions regarding the policy are likely to come up when the central bank holds its monetary policy meeting next week. 

“The thing is yields can move a bit higher but they can’t move significantly higher - there is too much debt out there,” he said.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 12:16PM ET</span>","LVMH refrains from renegotiating Tiffany deal, sources say","By Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) - French luxury goods giant (PA:LVMH) is not asking to renegotiate its $16.2-billion acquisition of U.S. jewelry chain  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF) after deliberating whether to do so, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault has been in talks with his advisers this week to identify ways to pressure Tiffany to lower the agreed price of $135 per share in cash, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
He considered whether he could argue that the New York-based company is in breach of its obligations under the merger agreement, sources said at the time. LVMH also said on Thursday that its board had discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its deal with Tiffany.
LVMH has decided it will not raise the issue of repricing the deal with Tiffany for now, after it considered the legal hurdles involved, the sources said. Arnault, who is also LVMH's controlling shareholder, continues to harbor concerns that the company is overpaying for Tiffany, some of the sources said.
The acquisition has yet to receive some of the necessary regulatory approvals, and LVMH could revisit the issue before the deal closes, especially if Tiffany's financial condition were to deteriorate. 
While Tiffany is in compliance with covenants it had agreed to with its creditors, LVMH will be closely monitoring Tiffany's finances in the coming weeks to see if this remains the case, the sources added. 
Were Tiffany to be in breach of the covenants, LVMH could use this as grounds under the merger agreement to call for a renegotiation of the terms, the sources said. For its part, Tiffany has been in discussions with its creditors to make sure it remains in compliance with its debt covenants, the sources added. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.
LVMH declined to comment, while Tiffany did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tiffany shares soared on the news and were trading up 8% at $123.95 in early morning trading on Friday. This represents an 8% discount to the $135 per deal share price. LVMH shares were trading up 3.4% at 403.3 euros ($456) in Paris.
Tiffany will give LVMH a bigger share of the lucrative U.S. market and expand its offerings in jewelry, the fastest-growing sector in luxury goods.
Consultancy Bain expects global sales of high-end clothing, handbags, jewelry and cosmetics to fall by up to 35% this year, as the coronavirus outbreak forced brands to shut shops across the globe and international travel has ground to a halt.
Several acquirers have abandoned or renegotiated deals in the wake of the pandemic. In the retail sector, buyout firm Sycamore Partners walked away last month from a $525 million deal to acquire a majority stake in L Brands Inc's (N:LB) Victoria's Secret.
LVMH, which is behind brands such as Fendi, Christian Dior and Givenchy, as well as Veuve Cliquot champagne, has stood out for several years as one of the top performers in the upscale retail sector.
Based in New York and best known for its diamond engagement rings, Tiffany operates more than 300 retail stores globally. It has been refreshing its offerings with more affordable items such as pendants and earrings, to appeal to millennials who have been gravitating to lower-priced competitors such as Denmark’s  Pandora  (OTC:PANDY) A/S (CO:PNDORA) and Signet Jewelers (N:SIG).

Tiffany is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on June 9.

544,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",U.S. will allow Chinese passenger carriers two flights per week,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said on Friday it will allow Chinese passenger air carriers to operate two flights per week after Beijing said it would ease coronavirus restrictions to allow in more foreign carriers.
On Wednesday, Washington said it planned to bar all Chinese passenger airlines from flying to the United States by June 16, due to Beijing's curbs on U.S. carriers. The revised Transportation Department order cuts in half the four weekly round trip flights Chinese passenger carriers have been flying to the United States and take effect immediately.
The department said if China takes further steps for U.S. carriers it is ""fully prepared to once again revisit the action."" The notice added that the department is ""troubled by China’s continued unilateral dictation of the terms of the U.S.-China scheduled passenger air transportation market without respect for the rights of U.S. carriers.""
The announcement defuses a potential new flashpoint in the U.S.-China relationship. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment.
China's announcement should allow U.S. carriers to resume once-a-week flights into a city of their choice starting on June 8, a fraction of what the U.S.-China aviation agreement allows. 
The U.S. limit affects U.S. roundtrip flights by Air China (SS:601111), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp, China Southern Airlines Co (SS:600029) and Xiamen Airlines Co. It is not immediately known which flights will be allowed to continue.
It is also unclear if U.S. carriers will agree to fly just once a week to China when they have sought approval for two or three daily flights.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) asked to resume flights to China this month. Both said they were studying China's action. 

China said all airlines can increase the number of international flights involving China to two per week if none of their passengers test positive for COVID-19 for three consecutive weeks.

545,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Long-Short Momentum Down 9% and Other Tales of a Shocked Market,"(Bloomberg) -- The latest U.S. jobs report will go down in history as the data that shocked economists. And the market.
Forecasts for a drop of 7.5 million in payrolls were met with the reality of a 2.5 million increase in May, supporting the view that the word’s largest economy may be more resilient than previously thought. A stock market already up 40% in a record period of time rallied further, with particular pockets going haywire.
From a blowup in the momentum factor trade to a surge in small-cap shares, here’s a sample of what was happening under the equity market’s surface Friday.
Winners Turn Losers
The momentum factor, which in essence bets that the recent winners will keep on winning, got pummeled Friday. At its lows, a Dow Jones market neutral momentum portfolio that goes long the highest momentum stocks and shorts those with the least momentum dropped 9% -- the worst day since at least 2002.
“The nature of the rally has changed,” said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist for Nuveen. “The stocks that had momentum have lost it. If this keeps going then the new momentum will be value. Everything has happened fast in 2020, it’s very much in keeping with that.”
The index pared some of its losses to 6.5%, but still posted the largest decline in a decade.
Smaller Is Better
Small-cap stocks surged on prospects of a faster economic rebound, sending the Russell 2000 up as much as 4.6%. The risk-on tone was evident in the large-cap arena too, with an equal-weight version of the S&P 500 that gives Coty (NYSE:COTY) Inc. just as much weight as  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). rising 4.3% at one point.
The equal-weight benchmark is up close to 10% this week, its best period versus the classic market-cap weighted index in two decades.
“If we want to make sense of the market move, we need to not just look at the S&P or the Nasdaq but look beyond that,” said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird. “Areas that lagged for years that made much more substantial lows are coming back as the economy transitions from worse-than-expected data to better-than-expected data.”
Airlines Fly, Cruise Ships Sail
Some of the best-performing stocks Friday were airlines and cruise lines. They were hit hard in the coronavirus stock crash and arguably stand to be among the first in line to benefit from a return to economic normal. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. was up 26%, extending its 41% record gain on Thursday.
Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings, Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp., United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd. were all up at least 15%.
Energized Energy
Among 11 S&P 500 sectors, energy was the best performing Friday, up more than 7%. Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). rose 23%, while  Apache Corp  (NYSE:APA). and  Noble Energy  Inc (NASDAQ:NBL). also added more than 12%.
“It’s all about the future and we are coming out of the storm,” said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Investment Associates. “It was a terrible storm that caused widespread destruction. Everything from this point on will be ‘less bad’ and even turn positive. Huge sentiment shift.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's high-street restaurant chains Bella Italia, Cafe Rouge and Las Iguanas could see around 30% of their outlets cut, two sources told Reuters, as their owner pushes ahead with talks to sell the businesses stricken by the COVID-19 crisis.
Casual Dining Group, owner of those chains and several others, is in negotiations with potential buyers for its entire estate, the sources said. 
The closure of outlets and some of the smaller chains in its portfolio are on the table as part of this, they added. 
Some of the smaller chains in CDG's portfolio - such as Belgian-inspired Belgo and Huxley Bar & Kitchen - could be at risk altogether, said one of the sources, with buyers looking to buy a leaner and more profitable business.
The company is also negotiating lower rents from landlords. 
CDG declined to comment. Its private equity owners KKR (N:KKR) and Pemberton Capital Advisors were not immediately available for comment. 
Last month the company hired Alix Partners and Kirkland & Ellis to explore options, including administration for all or part of the group.
Slim margins and overcapacity mean many restaurant chains in Britain will downsize or disappear from the high street altogether after nearly three months of closures due to the novel coronavirus lockdown.
With the industry preparing to reopen from July, social distancing is expected to hit it hard given its dependence on heavy footfall and quick turnaround of customers.
""Social distancing is not going away any time soon and the issues that had previously weighed on the food industry, such as business rates, and food and drinks' increase in costs, are being exacerbated by the crisis,"" said Ciara Cullen, food and drinks lawyer at RPC (NYSE:RES).
For an overview of popular high-street restaurants seeking restructuring, click here [nL8N2D15JO]
An industry study by CGA AlixPartners Market Recovery Monitor shows that at the end of March this year, the pre-lockdown number of licensed premises in Britain stood at 115,108, a 2.4% reduction on March 2019.
That rate of decline is set to accelerate rapidly in the coming months.
Although 96% of business leaders in the pub, bar and restaurant industry are expecting a phased re-start, only a third believe they will eventually re-open all their sites for trading, according to the report.
Italian high street chain Carluccio's was recently sold to Boparan Restaurants, owner of the Giraffe chain, which will only retain 30 out of its 70 sites. [nL8N2D449R]

LONDON (Reuters) - Easing European Union securities rules could help recapitalise companies more quickly and assist the recovery of the economy from its COVID-19 recession, an EU document suggests.
The EU had already begun a review of its MiFID II securities law and a European Commission discussion paper set out initial ideas on how this could become part of a ""COVID recovery package"".
""This note aims to initiate a debate on whether urgent remedies across the spectrum of securities markets legislation might serve as one of many tools to facilitate an early recovery after the COVID crisis abates,"" the document seen by Reuters said. It follows a ""quick fix"" package of capital relief measures for banks.
Ideas include confining cost and charges disclosures to retail investors, reducing the need for a ""suitability assessment"" each time an investment decision is taken, and easing the requirement for conversations with investors to be recorded.
Stringent protections for products could be confined to more complex products, it added.
It suggests a temporary five-year suspension of rules that require detailed record keeping when issuers ""sound out"" investors about interest in a transaction. The need to keep ""insider lists"" could also be suspended for five years after the first listing.
The introduction of a ""short form"" prospectus for companies that are already listed in the bloc to raise money could also make it easier for companies to raise funds faster, it said.
A prospectus is currently not needed for trading shares exchanged from other securities if they represent less than 20% of shares that has already been admitted to trading.
With rapid recapitalisation of companies needed after the COVID crisis, the 20% threshold could be temporarily suspended or increased, the document said.
A group of experts will publish recommendations next Wednesday to deepen the EU's capital markets, a five-year project made all the more urgent by COVID-19 and Brexit.

The European Commission has said it will make legislative proposals for securities markets around October.

553,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 10:37AM ET</span>",Hong Kong's free media fears being silenced by China's national security law,"By James Pomfret and Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - When a team of producers at Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) heard on May 19 that the publicly funded broadcaster planned to axe one of its most popular weekly shows, they rushed to the building next door to confront the station's head.
A group of about 20 producers and other employees from RTHK’s TV and radio operations barged into a conference room where Leung Ka-wing, director of broadcasting, was meeting with top executives. 
Some staff demanded to know why the satirical and current affairs television show “Headliner” – which had drawn official complaints after poking fun at the Hong Kong police in an episode in February - was being cancelled, and whether the move was prompted by pressure from authorities.
The impromptu meeting lasted about 90 minutes, during which several staffers cried and raised their voices, according to three people present. Leung said he took the decision to cancel the show in order to “protect RTHK” and its staff, according to the three people.  
As conversations continued inside the conference room, RTHK announced it was suspending production of the Chinese-language show, which had been running since 1989, at the end of the current season. RTHK apologized to anyone offended by the station’s output but did not give a reason for the suspension. 
Leung, 67, who made his name in broadcasting during the Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in 1989, declined to answer Reuters’ questions about the meeting. He denied making the comment about protecting RTHK, according to RTHK spokeswoman Amen Ng. Other executives in the meeting that Reuters could identify did not reply to requests for comment. 
Hong Kong’s government did not comment on whether it had pressured Leung to cancel the show. 
RTHK, founded in 1928 and sometimes compared to the British Broadcasting Corporation, is the only independent, publicly funded media outlet on Chinese soil. It is guaranteed editorial independence by its charter.
The cancellation of “Headliner” has prompted fear among some journalists that mounting pressure from the Hong Kong government and Beijing will destroy that independence. 
Hong Kong reached boiling point last summer as millions of pro-democracy protesters took to the streets and some of them clashed violently with police, posing one of the biggest challenges to China’s leader Xi Jinping since he came to power in 2012.
In response to the protests, China said last month it would introduce national security legislation in Hong Kong to prohibit secession, subversion and external interference. More than a dozen people working at RTHK and other media organizations told Reuters they fear that legislation could be used to silence or shut down independent media in the territory.
The situation is like being under the blade of a guillotine, said Jimmy Lai, the publisher of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper, which like RTHK, has for years drawn the ire of Hong Kong’s government and Beijing: “There’s no half-way. It’s falling.”
Lai, 72, has been repeatedly denounced by state-run Beijing media and pro-China media in Hong Kong, painting him as the local face of what they describe as a U.S. interference campaign. He has been arrested twice this year on charges of illegal assembly related to protests last year.
Lai and some other members of the media fear the new legislation - which has not yet been set out in detail - will make Hong Kong more like mainland China, where the ruling Communist Party runs or controls the vast majority of media and routinely censors dissenting views. The country imprisoned at least 48 journalists last year, more than any other country, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam has denied the new legislation would curtail media freedom, saying last month that “freedom of expression, freedom of protest, freedom of journalism, will stay.” Hong Kong is guaranteed freedom of speech and the press under Article 27 of the Basic Law, the mini-constitution agreed by China when it took back control of former British colony in 1997.
A spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Reuters the proposed legislation “only targets activities related to subversion, separatism, terrorism and foreign interference into Hong Kong affairs,” and that it will “not affect freedom of speech, media freedoms, or any other rights and freedoms.”  
China’s Liaison Office in Hong Kong, Beijing’s official base in the city, did not reply to requests for comment on whether China sought to control or suppress RTHK or if the new national security legislation would curtail media freedom in Hong Kong.
UNDER THE MICROSCOPE
Scrutiny of RTHK has increased dramatically since late February, when a two-minute segment on “Headliner” entitled ‘Police Farce Report’ showed an actor dressed as a Hong Kong police officer standing inside a large rubbish container with his hands covered in plastic. 
The skit shows police in various situations wearing biohazard suits and masks, satirizing how well equipped police officers are compared to medical workers. The actor, Kwong Ngai-yee, told Reuters the idea was based on the “Sesame Street” puppet Oscar the Grouch and that he hoped to “ease public anger through humour.”
Hong Kong police were not amused. The force’s commissioner Chris Tang complained to Leung in writing in early March, saying the show ""smeared the police and their work during the coronavirus period."" RTHK had ""reversed right and wrong, and we simply can't accept it,"" Tang wrote in the letter, which was made public by RTHK. 
On the morning of May 19, Hong Kong’s Communications Authority, which regulates the city’s broadcast and telecoms sectors, published a report criticizing the broadcaster, saying the segment “smeared the police by suggesting that the police were trash, worthless and revulsive.”
As the RTHK employees met with Leung that evening, Hong Kong’s Commerce and Economic Development Bureau, which oversees RTHK, released a statement on its website demanding that the broadcaster examine its production and editorial processes and “follow up or take disciplinary actions” on any staff found to have committed ""negligence or errors.""
Nine days later, the Commerce Bureau announced an unprecedented, government-led review of RTHK’s governance and management – spanning its administration, financial control and manpower - to ensure it complies with its charter. The review is expected to be concluded by the end of the year.
A spokesman for the Commerce Bureau told Reuters in an email that RTHK has editorial independence, but as a government department, RTHK and its staff “are subject to all applicable government rules and regulations.”
“Ultimately RTHK is part of the government, and in theory it could do anything to us,” said Gladys Chiu, the chairperson of RTHK’s programme staff union, which represents about 400 of the station's 700 staff. The new legislation and increased scrutiny of RTHK could be used ""to coerce the staff into broadcasting or reporting in a way that is approved by the government,"" she said. 
RTHK also faces pressures at street level. Small groups of pro-Beijing protesters regularly gather outside its headquarters in Kowloon, waving Chinese flags and signs accusing the broadcaster of anti-government bias.
“Shut it down,” the crowds chanted continuously during one protest in January, according to video news coverage, while calling RTHK a “cockroach” station, a description some police have used to describe pro-democracy protesters.
Some RTHK staff have been threatened in social media posts and targeted in the pro-Beijing media in Hong Kong for perceived anti-government bias. Some pro-Beijing lawmakers also routinely attack RTHK. One outspoken critic, Junius Ho, last month demanded the broadcaster become a “government mouthpiece.” 
“It’s very worrying because we see RTHK being reined in by every means,” said Shirley Yam, vice chairperson of the Hong Kong Journalists Association. 
RISING TENSION
China and the United States have been engaged in a tit-for-tat spat over the presence of the other’s journalists for several months. 
The United States slashed the number of journalists permitted to work at Chinese state-owned media outlets in the country to 100 from 160, citing a deepening crackdown on independent reporting inside China. In March, Beijing revoked the media credentials of about a dozen American reporters working in mainland China for the Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT), saying the reporters would not be allowed to relocate and work in Hong Kong.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on the State Department’s website last month that the Chinese government “has threatened to interfere with the work of American journalists in Hong Kong,” without giving details. 
A source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters that if the row with the United States escalates further, Beijing could intervene in the issuance of work visas for foreign journalists in Hong Kong.
The spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: ""Visa (NYSE:V) issues are a matter of national sovereignty. The Chinese government manages affairs related to foreign media and foreign journalists according to laws and regulations.""
Intervening in the issuance of journalists’ visas would be a highly contentious move for Hong Kong, which although part of China, operates with a high degree of autonomy. In 2018, the visa of the Financial Times’ Asia editor, Victor Mallet, was not renewed by Hong Kong after he moderated a speech by a pro-independence activist at an event hosted by the Foreign Correspondents’ Club (FCC) in the city. The move alarmed some diplomats and business groups in Hong Kong. 
The event angered China, and a senior official said at the time that the FCC had broken the law by hosting a ""separatist."" Hong Kong authorities never publicly explained why Mallet’s visa had not been renewed, saying they could not comment on individual cases.
Hong Kong’s global media freedom ranking is in free-fall. Reporters without Borders (RSF) said Hong Kong fell to 80th place in 2020 in its global press freedom index, down from 18th in 2002. Over the past year, reporters covering protests in the city have been detained, pepper-sprayed and shot with rubber bullets and tear gas canisters by police. 

“A security law dictated by China would give a massive blow to press freedom in Hong Kong,” said Cédric Alviani, the head of RSF’s East Asia bureau. “(It would) allow the regime to engage in the type of intimidation that we see on their side of the border.”

Volkswagen's management board, headed by Chief Executive Herbert Diess meets regularly on Tuesdays.
In the clip, a black man is depicted next to a new VW Golf, being pushed around by an oversized white hand, which then flicks him into a building adorned with the sign ""Petit Colon"".
Petit Colon is a real cafe in Buenos Aires, Argentina, located near the Teatro Colon. In French the term translates into ""small settler,"" which has colonial undertones.
Criticism of the advert went viral last month and the company apologised and pulled the clip, prompting VW's labour leaders to accuse Volkswagen's management of damaging the company.
""The clip is disgusting and inexcusable,"" Volkswagen works council member Bernd Osterloh said at the time.
Volkswagen itself admitted that the advert was racist and insulting. It said that agencies usually produce its advertising campaigns and it was investigating where the mistake happened and would make its findings public.

559,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>","Bombardier to cut 2,500 aviation jobs as pandemic dents travel demand","(Reuters) - Canadian plane and train maker  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) said on Friday it would cut 2,500 jobs, or about 11% of the workforce at its aviation unit, as the coronavirus pandemic's crushing impact on the air industry adds to its long list of problems.
The aviation industry has been among the worst hit by the pandemic, which has dented travel demand and forced several aircraft manufacturers, including planemakers  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR), to cut production as customers defer deliveries.
""We are now faced with the difficult decision to adjust the size of our business, considering both disruptions in our supply chain as well as industry-wide forecasts calling for approximately 30% year-over-year drops in unit deliveries due to the pandemic,"" David Coleal, president of Bombardier Aviation, said in a memo to workers about the layoffs which was seen by Reuters.
Bombardier Aviation spokesman Mark Masluch said the company is starting to scale back production, but he would not give specifics.
Bombardier, which has nearly 60,000 employees at its aviation and rail units, said it would book a $40 million charge related to the job cuts.
The company, which recently exited the commercial aircraft business, is in the process of selling its rail business to French train maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) for up to 6.2 billion euros ($7.02 billion). 
The sale would leave Bombardier as a “pure play” business jetmaker. 
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said the layoffs would affect 717 of its members in Montreal who are now benefiting from an emergency wage subsidy program implemented by the Canadian government to counter the fallout from the outbreak of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. 
The union said in a statement that “Bombardier had the means to avoid the layoffs today,” if it extended the program, which runs through the end of August.
Masluch said the company needed to act now to give required notice about the layoffs.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets surged at the opening on Friday after an expected and large rise in employment in May strengthened hopes that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic was over, and bolstered confidence in a speedy, 'V-shaped' recovery.
By 9:37 AM ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 672 points, or 2.6%, at a three-month high of 26,954 points. The S&P 500 rose 2.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4%. 
The Labor Department had earlier reported that the economy created 2.509 million net jobs in the month to mid-May, causing the jobless rate to fall from its postwar high of 14.7% to 13.3%. Analysts had expected nonfarm payrolls to shrink by 8 million.
""There will naturally be some doubt lingering about these figures given they are telling such a different story to all other data on the labor market, but these are the official ones and on the face of it are fantastic,"" ING's chief international economist James Knightley said in a research note. ""It suggests the American economy can bounce back very vigorously and we all need to massively revise up our economic projections.""
The biggest individual gainers were, again, those that had lost the most on the way down, including Hertz Global and  Luckin Coffee  (NASDAQ:LK), both of which have already filed for bankruptcy protection. Among more viable businesses, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock both rose 23%, the latter helped further by reports that OPEC and its allies will meet on Saturday to confirm a one-month extension to the current deal keeping a total of 9.7 million barrels a day of oil off world markets.  
U.S. Crude futures hit their highest in three months on the news, rising as high as $39.55 a barrel before retracing a little to trade at $39.05, up 4.4% on the day.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock rose 10.1% while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 7.1%.
Elsewhere, Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) stock rebounded 8.3% after reports that LVMH has decided not to try to revise the terms of its $16 billion deal for the jeweler.
As has been the pattern recently, money was redirected to cyclical stocks (including cruise lines and banks) from tech stocks whose growth profile had made them a safe haven during the worst of the market stress in March and April. 
Messaging service Slack suffered particularly after it reported that the boom in working from home hadn't moved its growth needle in the last three months. Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) stock fell 16%, while teleconferencer  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) stock fell a more modest 5.1%.

564,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>",The Stock Rebound Really Gets Going After Wall Street Logs Off,"(Bloomberg) -- This year has brought more than its share of sleepless nights for many traders -- at least now they come with some big returns.
The S&P 500’s staggering rally from its March low has mostly been powered by a sentiment shift overnight, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A trader who bought the SPDR S&P 500 ETF at the Wall Street close and sold at the next open would have made 23% since the trough compared with 13% for holding the same ETF only during normal trading hours, the data show.
In fact, the after-hours trade looks like it led the U.S. stock rebound. Overnight sentiment bottomed two days before the S&P 500, and outperformance measured from that date was even more extreme.
“It reflects the optimism in the U.S. stock market from investors in Asia, as the Fed gave the green light to own U.S. assets,” said Dave Lutz, a managing director at JonesTrading who was referring to the central bank’s emergency measures.
The return to form for the trade, which historically outperforms but was derailed in the coronavirus turmoil, adds another layer of mystery to the market’s current defiance of gravity. The S&P 500 is up by more than a third since March even as the pandemic batters the economy and large-scale protests sweep America.
The trade may look like easy money, but it also means holding a position that could swing wildly amid an unpredictable news flow.
As the virus began to spread through the world at the start of the year, headlines rolled in throughout the night and the after-hours strategy lost 30% in the first quarter, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The day trade gained 6%.
For now, however, investors seem to have moved on from the first quarter chaos and put night terrors to one side."

LONDON (Reuters) - The BBC appointed an insider as its new director general on Friday, tasked with securing the future direction and financing of the publicly-funded British broadcaster in the wake of government scepticism of the current model.
Tim Davie, currently head of BBC Studios and responsible for international brand and editorial strategy, will replace Tony Hall at the start of September in the most high-profile broadcasting job in Britain.
He will be editor in chief of Britain's biggest news provider and lead the country's most powerful cultural institution at a time when critics say its universal funding model, based on a fee paid by all households, is outdated. 
""This has been a critical time for the UK and these past few months have shown just how much the BBC matters to people,"" Davie said. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has questioned whether the 98-year-old corporation should be supported by the licence fee, given the growth of subscription services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and many in his Conservative Party have long criticised the BBC for what they perceive to be a left-leaning political bias.
Davie, 53, will oversee a review of the BBC's funding in 2022 and negotiate the future of the licence fee when its charter is renewed in 2027. 
It had an income of more than 5 billion pounds ($6 billion) in the 2019/20 year, with more than 3.5 billion pounds coming from the licence fee.
The BBC's television, radio and online content reaches 92% of the population, and its news and programmes, such as sci-fi drama ""Doctor Who"" and natural history documentaries pioneered by David Attenborough, have shaped Britain's culture.
But in recent years, the Beeb, as it is known in Britain, has come under criticism for awarding extravagant salaries to its stars, paying some women less than men and for what some politicians say is a London-centric bias.
Culture minister Oliver Dowden said he welcomed Davie's commitment to reform and impartiality.
Davie stepped into the director general role temporarily in 2012 after a broadcast about unfounded sex abuse allegations, in the wake of revelations about famous BBC presenter Jimmy Savile, resulted in the resignation of George Entwistle.

The redundancies at the Volkswagen-owned (DE:VOWG_p) Bentley brand follow cuts, totalling up to 2,000 jobs, announced on Thursday at luxury rival  Aston Martin  (L:AML) and at car dealership Lookers (L:LOOK).
The 100-year old Bentley, which has a total workforce of 4,200, said it was offering voluntary redundancy terms but could not rule out compulsory redundancies.
""This is a necessary step that we have to take to safeguard the jobs of the vast majority who will remain, and deliver a sustainable business model for the future,"" said chairman and chief executive Adrian Hallmark.
""COVID-19 has not been the cause of this measure but a hastener.""
Bentley makes most of its cars in Crewe, north west England. The site reopened on May 11, seven weeks after it shut due to the coronavirus outbreak, making it one of the first automakers to resume production in Britain.
The firm faces hundreds of millions of pounds of deferred or lost revenue from the plant closure and reduced output due to the pandemic.
The job losses form part of Bentley's ""Beyond100"" strategy that will see it accelerate the development of electrified models.
It is targeting for every model it offers to have the option of a hybrid variant by 2023, and its first pure electric model to be launched in 2026.

British new car sales tumbled by an annual 89% in May, only slightly less negative than April's record 97% collapse, as car dealerships remained shuttered by the lockdown, industry data showed on Thursday.

570,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",EU’s Barnier Warns No Significant Progress Made in Brexit Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- European Union Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier said no significant progress was made in this week’s talks with the U.K. over the two sides’ future relationship.
“There has been no significant progress since the start of these talks,” Barnier told reporters in Brussels on Friday after the conclusion of the final week of negotiations before Prime Minister Boris Johnson meets top EU officials. “We have less than five months to reach agreement.”
Both sides had hoped to make significant steps forward this week but were thwarted by deep disagreements on the most crucial issues: fishing rights, a level playing field for business, and the role of European judges in overseeing any deal.
With a tacit acknowledgment the two negotiating teams have run out of road, it will now be up to political leaders to provide fresh impetus. Johnson is scheduled to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later this month.
The end of June marks the deadline for both sides to ask to extend the negotiating period beyond the year-end, something the prime minister has repeatedly ruled out doing.
If Johnson and von der Leyen can have a constructive meeting, they will trigger intensive work between the U.K. and EU over the coming months, although no further rounds of negotiations have yet been scheduled.
Germany’s ambassador to the bloc, Michael Clauss, warned this week the deliberations could drag on through October, spelling months of uncertainty for businesses and consumers.
The two sides have clashed over what measures will be needed to ensure a level competitive playing field between the two sides as well as over the EU’s demand to have the same access as it has today to U.K. fishing waters, which are among the most fertile in Europe.
Despite an intense focus this week on fishing, a discussion officials wanted to wrap up by the end of this month, there is still huge disagreement. The British are pressing for the EU to back down from its demand to maintain the status quo, which benefits countries like France and Spain. Instead, the U.K. wants to grant access through annual negotiations. The EU says there can be no overall trade deal without an agreement on the issue.

572,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 07:02AM ET</span>",Stocks - US Futures Higher Ahead of Employment Report,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Friday, continuing the recent bullish rally ahead of the release of the official monthly employment report.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 24 points, or 0.8%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 32 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Futures contract rose 307 points, or 1.2%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average cash index posted its highest close Thursday since March 4, and is on a four-day winning streak. The S&P 500 index recorded its first down day in five on Thursday, while the Nasdaq 100 index notched up an intraday record high. The Nasdaq Composite, which is more closely watched than the Nasdaq 100, is just about 2% below its own record high, 
Stimulus measures to limit the economic damage from closures in the wake of the coronavirus-inspired social distancing measures have helped to support stock prices since the lows in March. The U.S. government has injected some $3 trillion in stimulus into the economy, while the Federal Reserve has drastically increased its balance sheet.
This positive tone could be tested by the release of the official employment report for May, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). 
While Thursday’s weekly initial jobless claims release showed a continuing reduction of people claiming unemployment benefits for the first time, the continuing claims figure actually rose.
The unemployment rate for May is projected to rise to 19.8%, approaching levels last seen during the Great Depression, from 14.7% in April, while nonfarm payrolls are estimated to have dropped another 8 million in the month. 
In corporate news, Gap (NYSE:GPS) will be in the spotlight after the retailer reported a $1.2 billion operating loss during its first quarter as a result of store closures and lost sales during the coronavirus pandemic. Stock dropped 4% premarket.
Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) dropped over 12% after the messaging service said it had failed to register any acceleration in revenue growth in the last three months, despite the boom in remote working that has been a godsend to providers of collaborative technology.
Oil prices headed higher Friday, with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries set to meet over the weekend to discuss an extension of production cuts.
U.S. crude prices rose 2.4% to $38.30 a barrel, while Brent Futures climbed 3.1% to $41.22.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 1.1% to $1,708.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1332 just off the three-month high that it hit overnight.

575,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 06:27AM ET</span>",EU Economy Chief Sees July Deal on 750 Billion-Euro Crisis Fund,"(Bloomberg) -- A deal on a 750 billion-euro ($850 billion) package to help the European Union’s economies recover from the virus-induced recession could be struck in July, the bloc’s economy chief said, even as countries have been voicing opposition to the proposal currently on the table.
Leaders will soon begin debating a plan by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, that would make as much as 500 billion euros in grants and 250 billion euros in loans available to the region’s nations. The program, which still needs to win the backing of EU governments, would be funded by joint debt issuance in a significant step toward closer financial integration.
“I think it’s possible that the agreement of the European Council will come in July,” EU Commissioner for Economic Affairs Paolo Gentiloni told Bloomberg TV, referring to the body comprised of the bloc’s 27 leaders. He added that Germany taking over the EU’s rotating presidency on July 1 will help reach an agreement on the package.
Some countries have raised issues with the commission’s proposal, signaling heated negotiations in the weeks ahead as they seek to find common ground. Governments from budgetary hardliners, including Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, are keen to ensure their taxpayers aren’t on the hook for future repayments, and are expected to put up a fight on various aspects of the package including its total size as well as the ratio of loans to grants.
Finland’s government said on Thursday it rejected the recovery fund in its current form and wanted to see changes, such as reducing the amount of grants and increasing the share of loans, while also cutting its size and duration.
Still, Gentiloni remained optimistic that a compromise was within reach.
“Nobody slammed the door,” he said. “The majority of member states are in a negotiating position and knowing how it functions here in the union, a negotiating position brings an agreement.”
The optimism was echoed by Germany’s ambassador to the EU, who also predicted a swift accord in the bloc over the proposed package. Michael Clauss told an online event Thursday organized by the Brussels-based European Policy Centre that EU countries realize the urgency of sealing an agreement, which he expects “before the summer.”
“We’ll see a lot of bargaining going on in the coming weeks,” Clauss said.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Airlines from America to Australia are ramping up flights in June and July, boosting hopes for a pickup in tourist traffic even as bigger-spending business and global travel remains sluggish during the ongoing pandemic.
American Airlines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) each announced more flights to key U.S. business and leisure destinations where national parks and outdoor recreational spaces are reopening after months of lockdowns and travel curbs, sending their shares sharply higher.
Chicago-based United is adding more non-stop flights as well as servicing markets like Aspen, Colorado and Jackson Hole, Wyoming where it said ""social distancing is a natural feature"" in the scenic landscapes.
""Leisure travel has been the most missed activity during lockdown across age and income demographics, even more so than things like restaurants,"" said Jason Guggenheim of Boston Consulting Group, which has surveyed consumers in the United States and Europe. 
""But it's going to take business travel longer to come back,"" he said, noting work-from-home models will remain in place for some time. 
Even with the schedule increases, analysts expect overall U.S. airline capacity will remain drastically lower this year; and without business travel, yields will likely remain negative, they said. Yield is the revenue an airline makes per mile flown.
Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR) outlined plans on Thursday for significant boosts to domestic capacity, while Emirates and Etihad Airways are restarting transit flights through hub airports in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

In Europe, Iberia - part of the International Consolidated Airlines Group (L:ICAG) - told customers on Thursday it is starting a schedule of regular flights from Spain in July as a first step to building back a full service.

578,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 05:38AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The ECB Makes Sure Every Bank Stock Dog Has Its Day,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It’s as if the world suddenly believes the euro has a future.
Eurozone bank stocks are flying on Friday in the wake of the European Central Bank’s actions on Thursday to ramp up the monetary stimulus and put the doubting Thomases firmly in their place.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the Stoxx 600 Banks index was up 3.8% at its highest in nearly three months, after analysts gave a resounding endorsement of the central bank’s decision to throw another 600 billion euros at anybody daring to suggest that individual member states may face the odd solvency problem when the pandemic is over. The benchmark STOXX 600 was up 1.1% at 370.15 points, also a three-month high.
Coming less than a week after the European Commission also rolled out a bigger-than-expected 750 billion euro fund for supporting next year’s recovery (two thirds of it in the form of direct grants rather than loans), the ECB’s package suggests that the euro zone is in serious danger of having a coherent set of macro policies, with fiscal and monetary policy-makers pulling together for the first time in a decade.
Above all, that means that the tail risk of a eurozone break has been substantially reduced, and a long-term weight on the valuations of assets in the bloc’s periphery, in particular, has been lifted.
In the 10 days since the Commission’s announcement, the spread between Italian and German 10-year benchmark yields has tightened from 200 basis points to 175 – a three-month low – and is falling fast. The Spanish spread has come in from 113 basis points to 87 in the same timeframe. Portugal’s risk premium over Germany has shrunk by one-third in the same timeframe, while Greece’s spread has come in from 204 to 165 basis points.
Small wonder, then, that peripheral banks are flying: the bonds they hold are skyrocketing, and the easing of lockdown restrictions aimed at facilitating some kind of summer tourist season should also flatten the peak of non-performing loans, as more local businesses manage to keep their heads above water.
It that all sounds too good to be true - well, it may well be.  BlueBay Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Mark Dowding warned in a blog post on Friday that “central bank purchases are fuelling asset price inflation as market technicals dominate. Yet this rally is coming against a backdrop in which the macroeconomy remains in a pretty dark place.” Not to be forgotten: the ECB’s latest growth forecasts for the bloc see the economy shrinking by 8.7% and not recouping those losses until after 2022.
But the Stoxx 600 Banks is still more than 40% below where it was in February. The sector has been one of the most reliable, longest-running dogs in the European investment universe – but then every dog has its day."
579,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",Investors With $12 Trillion Call for Green EU Recovery Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- Global investors managing 11 trillion euros ($12 trillion) are demanding a rapid green recovery in Europe to avoid worsening financial, health and social problems.
In an open letter, investors including BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management and  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Investment Management called for money to be poured into clean infrastructure, such as electric cars and wind turbines, as well as flood defenses and crop resilience that will protect people from the worst impacts of climate change.
Central bankers from the U.K., France and the Netherlands added their voice in an op-ed in the Guardian newspaper, which called the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to prepare for climate change.
European leaders will meet on June 19 to discuss a 750 billion-euro recovery fund proposed by the European Commission. It’s the world’s greenest stimulus plan to deal with the economic devastation caused by the pandemic. But even if EU leaders give the go-ahead, negotiations for the budget will continue for several months.
The investor letter with 109 signatories said EU countries should adopt the Commission’s plans and go further with their own national strategies. A key demand of the group is to attach green strings to any financial support given to polluting industries such as airlines, in line with a goal to zero out emissions by 2050.
“As a prudent investor, we need to make sure our investments are sustainable in the long run and do not end up as stranded assets,” said Dewi Dylander, deputy executive director at Danish pension fund PKA, which is a signatory of the letter and manages 44 billion euros, of which 9.7% are green.
Dylander, who is also a former head of the Danish government’s climate negotiations, said Europe’s green recovery would also spur other countries to follow suit. Europe was due to host global climate change negotiations this year in Glasgow, Scotland, but they have now been pushed back to November 2021 because of the pandemic.
While the EU is “sending all the right signals,” details of specific policies are still lacking, said Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive officer of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, which organized the letter. “There is more work to do on that to send the right market signals.”
In their op-ed, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau, Netherlands central bank’s Frank Elderson, and United Nations Special Envoy Mark Carney pledged to work together and use their financial stability mandates and expertise to ensure climate risks are effectively managed.
“Unless we act now, the climate crisis will be tomorrow’s central scenario and, unlike Covid-19, no one will be able to self-isolate from it,” they wrote. “We have a choice: rebuild the old economy, locking in temperature increases of 4C with extreme climate disruption; or build back better, preserving our planet for generations to come.”

BEIJING (Reuters) - Three weeks ago, Beijing authorities swooped in on Shan Peng and her makeshift street stall, seizing her merchandise - yogurt and casual pants - and even her electric tricycle. 
She was used to police evictions. 
""Just raise your gun an inch, sir, and we peddlers would be able to get by,"" she would say, begging them to let her off.
In the same busy alley today, the 51-year-old was selling shrink-wrapped bacon out of a cardboard box - unharassed.
Shan hoped to take home at least 100 yuan ($14) a day. She has mouths to feed - her elderly mother, a dog she rescued from a shelter, and herself, a cancer patient. 
Street stalls, seen officially as a blight on China's modernising urban landscape, are making an unexpected comeback in a year of rare economic pain. 
At the annual session of parliament last month, the livelihoods of ordinary people were widely discussed. Afterwards, Premier Li Keqiang told reporters 600 million people still live on monthly salaries of 1,000 yuan. 
The spectre of mass unemployment has sharpened the focus of China's top leadership on low-income groups with little financial backup to cope with job losses. 
In a U-turn, authorities said last week local governments will not be assessed by the number of roadside vendors in their cities this year. In the past, municipal officials were awarded high marks for eradicating hawkers. 
The premier also gave his blessing. During a visit to a seaside town in Shandong province, Li said the ""street stall economy"" was the light of humanity and the vitality of China. 
READY, GET SET
With uncharacteristic speed, cities like Shanghai and Chengdu have taken steps to promote their street stall economies. Even Wuhan - former epicentre of China's COVID-19 outbreak - joined in as the coronavirus threat receded. 
E-commerce giants pledged support.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com said they would sell merchandise to street-stall owners on credit.  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) will offer discounts on a range of ""must-haves"" for setting up a stall such as flashlights and small fans. 
Wuling Motors said a newl mini truck specially designed for street stalls received more orders on Wednesday alone than all of May, official media reported. Its Hong Kong shares rose over 200% this week.
Dongfeng Motor Group and Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) said some of their vans can be modified to suit vegetable sellers or BBQ street food vendors.
Meanwhile, a PDF book of unknown authorship on how to be a successful street peddler found fame on social media this week. 
According to ""The Secret Manual of Street Stall Business"", only the latest mobile phones must be sold, and there should be no displays of bras and panties, for ""no young girl would dare to buy them in the open"".
LUNCH MONEY
Some economists say street stalls will not make much difference to gross domestic product, but reflect the enormous pressure on the government to stabilise employment and curb any social unrest. 
""It's an emergency and temporary solution to the unemployment woes brought on by the coronavirus,"" said Nie Wen, economist at Shanghai-based Hwabao Trust.
Wang Kang, 38, works at a mobile payment company. But with his salary slashed by 30%, he started hawking t-shirts and toys in the evenings. 
""I'm here because I need the money,"" he said. ""Even if it's just tens of yuan per night, that's enough for lunch.""
Yi Shaohua, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, China's top state think-tank, said the street stall campaign will at least help lift people's spirits.
""The upshot is it'll get people out of their homes, add liveliness to the streets and thus help boost economic confidence,"" Yi said.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), owned by India's Tata Motors (NS:TAMO), has entered into agreements with lenders in China for a secured term loan facility of 5 billion yuan ($704.50 million), marking its first debt financing in China, it said. 
Arthur Yu, JLR's vice president and China chief financial officer, said the Chinese banks that would provide it with the three-year revolving loan include Bank of China (SS:601988), ICBC (SS:601398), China Construction Bank (SS:601939), Bank of Communications (SS:601328) and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SS:600000).
The fundraising comes as the coronavirus pandemic has hit global automakers' supply chains and sales. Sales from China used to account for 25% to 30% of JLR's global sales, but over the past two months make up 50%, Yu said.
The loan facility ""can help JLR China better manage cash flow amid the coronavirus epidemic"", Yu told reporters on Friday.
JLR, which imports cars and also has a manufacturing partnership in the Chinese eastern city of Changshu with Wuhu-based Chery Automobile, said its China sales in April were level with same period last year, and it saw sales growth in May. 
Yu said the company expects sales of China's luxury car segment this year to be level with last year or see slight growth.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Friday, helped by more support from the European Central Bank which has boosted hopes of a relatively speedy recovery in the region.
At 3:55 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.3% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 2.4%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 1.3%. 
These indexes have posted strong gains this week, with the DAX up 9.7%, the CAC 40 up 9.4%, and the FTSE 100 underperforming,  rising just 5.7%.
The ECB offered up, on Thursday, another massive jolt of stimulus for the region, practically doubling its planned bond purchases to 1.35 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion). Sovereign bond yield spreads narrowed to their tightest since March in reaction.
This “decision should dent any future speculation about whether or not the ECB is willing to play its role of lender of last resort for the eurozone,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
And it’s likely this won’t be the last of the central bank’s largesse. 
“We judge that a further increase in the PEPP [Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program] envelope will likely follow later this year. This reflects the deep recession in the economy and the significant disinflation it will trigger over coming years,” said analysts at ABN Amro, in a note to clients.
The banking sector led the way, with Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) up 6.5%,  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) gaining 5.8% and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) up 4.8%. Banks in the southern periphery of the euro zone fared even better, as the ECB's action dovetailed with increased optimism as regards summer tourist flows.
That optimism drove IAG (LON:ICAG) shares up 12% in Madrid, and Air France-KLM and Norwegian Air Shuttle all posting gains of over 10%. Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) shares rose 7.2% despite the news that it will be dropped from the DAX as of June 22. 
The focus later Friday will switch to the release of the U.S. employment report, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). 
The unemployment rate for May is projected to rise to 19.8% from 14.7% in April, while nonfarm payrolls are estimated to have dropped another 8 million in the month.  
Oil prices pushed higher Friday, amid reports a video conference of a group of leading oil producers, known as OPEC+, would be held on Saturday.
At 4 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $37.98 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.1% to $40.84.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,711.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1349, up 0.1%."

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 1.2% by 0722 GMT, led by a 3% jump in bank stocks (SX7P). Insurers (SXIP), automakers (SXAP) and travel stocks (SXTP) also rose more than 2%. 
Global equity markets have climbed strongly this week, with Wall Street indexes nearing record levels as investors focussed on re-opening of economies. 
The STOXX 600 is about 15% below all-time highs, but has recovered more than 37% from March lows as fresh stimulus plans for Europe spurred a move into economically sensitive cyclical sectors.

The airline sought to extend the maturity of the debt, originally due on June 3, after its operations took a hit from coronavirus-linked travel restrictions.
Sukuk holders representing more than 90% of the bond value had agreed to the extension as of Friday, he said, but the company is still waiting until June 10 for all holders to vote. 
Garuda offered a fee of up to 1.25% to sukuk holders who voted in favour of its proposal before June 1.
""We have put forward a proposal that makes sense in this current situation. Hopefully in three years, conditions will improve and we can execute our obligations,"" Setiaputra said.
Travel restrictions have resulted in a 90% drop in passengers volume at Garuda, which posted profit of $6.5 million last year, and forced the company to slash costs and focus its business in cargo and chartered flights, Setiapurtra said.
A presentation document Garuda posted on its website said the company sees potential for a 10% increase in cargo revenue this year. 

According to the document, last year Garuda group carried 335,764 tonnes of cargo with a yield of 43.8 cents per tonne per mile.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",Britain cracks down on 'vulture' pensions advisers,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's markets watchdog has banned contingent charging after lawmakers criticised financial advisors for ripping off steelworkers facing critical decisions about their pensions.
Contingent charging refers to financial advisers not earning their fee unless they recommend a specific course of action for an accrued defined benefit pension.
""The ban will remove the conflicts of interest which arise where a financial adviser only gets paid if a (pension pot) transfer goes ahead,"" the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said in a statement.
""It will also help good advisers, who will often advise (pension holders) to stay put, to compete.""
In a 2018 parliamentary report, lawmakers criticised the FCA for being too slow to prevent ""vulture"" advisers ripping off steelworkers in Port Talbot, Wales, by forcing them to choose between moving their British Steel pension to a new company scheme or joining a lifeboat scheme.
A lifeboat scheme is one set up by the government to protect pension benefits accrued by members when their employer becomes insolvent.
The FCA said on Friday that in reviewing pensions advice given in defined benefit cases across the market, it found that the percentage of clients given unsuitable advice in the British Steel scheme was higher than those in the rest of the sample.
The watchdog will write to 7,700 former members of the British Steel scheme to help them to revisit the advice they received, and to complain if they have concerns.
The FCA is undertaking 30 enforcement investigations arising from its scrutiny of the defined pensions advice market.
The watchdog had said in 2018 that evidence did not show that contingent charging was the main driver of poor outcomes for customers and would carry out further analysis.

589,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 03:06AM ET</span>",Ocean shipping shrinks as pandemic pummels retailers,"By Jonathan Saul, Lisa Baertlein and Sonya Dowsett
LONDON/LOS ANGELES/MADRID (Reuters) - The $1 trillion container shipping industry is in a slowdown. Literally.
Some shipping lines, whose retail customers are being hammered by the coronavirus pandemic, are reducing sailing speeds and taking longer routes around Africa, avoiding Suez canal passage fees, according to the companies and ship-tracking specialists. 
Many are also cutting down the number of voyages and providing short-term storage for clients as the industry, which includes heavyweights like Maersk (CO:MAERSKb), MSC and Hapag-Lloyd (DE:HLAG), faces its biggest downturn since the 2008 financial crisis.
The new tactics not only save on costs, but also help adapt to the needs of cash-crunched retailers - among their biggest customers - who are stuck with huge inventory surpluses thanks to COVID-19 store closures and a collapse in consumer demand.
Slower shipping times also means importers can delay payments made on delivery.
From sportswear maker Puma (DE:PUMG) to mall stalwart Gap (N:GPS), many retailers have been forced to reduce or slow down shipments of new merchandise. Civil unrest in the United States has compounded their problems by further clouding the prospect for a recovery in the world's biggest retail sales market.
Puma's Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden, for example, said it was managing some of its excess inventory by stowing it on slow-going ships as stores in the United States and Europe tentatively reopen. 
However, at the same time, the shipping slowdown has created headaches for those retailers, from Walmart (N:WMT) and Amazon (O:AMZN) to shoe seller Rothy's, who have never stopped selling products to homebound consumers, ranging from books and shoes to exercise equipment, much of it sold online. 
Now those retailers are fighting for space on the fewer, faster-moving ships on the high seas.
""What we are seeing is quite a mixed situation from cargo owners, some of which are resuming normal shipment of their cargoes, others are requesting routings via longer transit times,"" said Marcus Leaver, chief operating officer of sea freight at Hellmann Worldwide Logistics, which organizes shipments for companies such as retailers.
A lack of space on ships is leading to more ""rollovers"", where containers are bumped from packed vessels to later ones, like passengers on oversold flights, according to importers.
Spanish retailer Mango, which has continued to sell online during the pandemic, told Reuters it was seeing an increase in service cancellations by shipping companies, which caused instability and ""space problems"".
It added that 99% of its imports from Asia were now coming by sea because air costs had gone up due to a lack of flights and the priority given to medical equipment.
'A LOT OF TROUBLE' 
The stakes are high for the container industry. Retail goods such as clothes, luggage and furniture represent about 15% of shipped volumes, a Reuters analysis of industry data shows.
Soren Skou, CEO of Maersk, the world's biggest container shipping group, said many of its big customers were retailers or suppliers to retailers. 
""There are some traditional retailers in a lot of trouble and, as you know, some have started to go bankrupt,"" Skou said last month. ""Some customers ask us to delay shipments and we have found extra storage and warehouse facilities for them.""
Shereen Zarkani, Maersk's global head of sales, told Reuters: ""One customer told us: If you make my container go around the world a couple of times that would be good.""
The volume of apparel arriving in the United States by ship dropped nearly 20% in January-May versus the same period last year, and reached 379,910 TEUs (20-foot equivalent container units), data from logistics technology company Descartes (NASDAQ:DSGX) showed. 
Furniture volumes fell over 12% in the same period, while luggage dropped over 34%.
The first blow landed when the novel coronavirus forced China to shutter factories in February, cutting off supplies of apparel, electronics and other retail goods to the world. The second came when stores in Europe and the United States closed, leading companies like Topshop owner Arcadia Group, Gap and off-price retailers Marshalls and TJ Maxx (N:TJX) to cancel orders.   
""When you look at the East-West trades we are right now looking at 15% to 20% (taken out) across the industry,"" Rolf Habben Jansen, CEO of German-based Hapag-Lloyd, said last month pointing to the fall in capacity in recent weeks.
OUTLOOK: STORMY
There does not appear to be any let-up in sight for container shipping companies as their retail clients could still be feeling acute financial pain in July, when they begin placing orders for holiday and winter merchandise.  
Jay Foreman, CEO of Florida-based toy supplier Basic Fun, which sells to retailers including Walmart and  Target  Corp (N:TGT), said he expected a 20% decrease in business this year. 
Indeed, the outlook for retail is dim: Euromonitor forecasts that U.S. retail sales will fall more than 6% this year. 
James Conroy, CEO of California-based clothing company Boot Barn Holdings (N:BOOT), told analysts it faced ""several headwinds"". 

""High unemployment, extremely depressed oil prices and a shift toward online shopping will present challenges for us as we progress through the next six to 12 months,"" he said.

ARCM, which owns around 15% of Premier's debt and has a large short position in its shares, has agreed to drop its appeal against a court scheme to facilitate Premier buying the BP assets, Premier said.
The deal will involve Premier paying BP $210 million in cash and reduces Premier's liability for field abandonment to $240 million from $600 million.
It replaces an initial scheme which would have involved a broader capital raising to pay the initial price of $625 million and extend Premier's debt maturities by two years.
""We are pleased to have agreed revised terms with BP for the proposed acquisition of the Andrew Area and Shearwater assets,"" Premier CEO Tony Durrant said, pointing to a plan to waive debt covenants until September.
""The (...) Agreement, once agreed with and approved by lenders, will provide a basis for the Company to continue discussions regarding proposed amendments to the Group's existing credit facilities.""
Premier, which had a market capitalisation of $336 million as of Thursday and $1.9 billion in net debt, will issue 82.2 million new shares to ARCM at a price of 26.69 pence each, a 9.64% discount to the volume weighted average price over the last five days to fund the BP assets, it said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks extended gains on Friday and were poised for their biggest weekly rise since 2011 while the euro hit a 1-1/2 month high as Europe's central bank surprised with more stimulus, fuelling hopes for a global rebound.
In a sign the positive mood was likely to spread elsewhere, E-mini futures for the S&P 500 jumped 0.8% to reach a three-month peak. Eurostoxx futures added 1.2%, futures for Germany's Dax gained 1.25% while those for London's FTSE were up 1%. 
Investors are pricing in a global economic recovery despite data showing the severe damage wrought by the coronavirus lockdowns. Later in the day, U.S. nonfarm payrolls figures are expected to show further deterioration in the country's jobs market.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan reversed early losses to hit a 12-week top of 511.73. 
The index is up more than 7% so far this week, on track for its best weekly showing since December 2011.
South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) was among the best performers on Friday, up 1.5% while Japan's Nikkei (N225) added 0.7%. 
Chinese shares turned positive as did Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI).
Analysts cautioned about the heady levels, with equity valuations at their highest since the dot.com boom in 2000, according to Matthew Sherwood, investment strategist for Perpetual.
Technical chart indicators suggest the market is at ""over-bought"" levels, Sherwood added, a signal that a correction is due.
World equity markets were thrashed in March when they hit ""bear territory"" on fears the COVID-19 driven lockdowns would push the global economy into a long and deep recession.
Market sentiment has since been bolstered by powerful central bank stimulus.
""Central banks have rightly stepped in to cushion the economic blow of COVID-19 and unquestionably succeeded in steadying the ship,"" said Bob Michele, chief investment officer and head of the global fixed income, currency & commodities group at J.P.Morgan Asset Management.
However, Michele warned the massive scale of quantitative easing would distort pricing and mute traditional signals from bond markets on growth and inflation, advocating ""co-investing"" alongside central banks.
Investor attention is now focused on Friday's U.S. employment report, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls fell in May by 8 million jobs after a record 20.54 million plunge in April.
The U.S. unemployment rate is forecast to rocket to 19.8%, a post-World War Two record, from 14.7% in April.
Currency markets show continued confidence in the expected revival of the global economy.
The euro (EUR=) hit a 12-week high of $1.1377 led by the European Central Bank's (ECB) plan to boost its emergency bond purchases.
The common currency is up 2.4% this week, on track for its third consecutive weekly gain.
All eyes will next be on the U.S. Federal Reserve, which holds its regular two-day policy meeting next week.
The U.S. dollar was a tad higher against the Japanese yen  at 109.32, having risen 1.4% so far this week. 
The risk sensitive Australian dollar  jumped to a five-month peak at $0.7004, on track for its third straight weekly rise.
In commodities, U.S. crude gained 16 cents to $37.57 per barrel and Brent added 32 cents to $40.31.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open higher Friday, boosted by more support from the European Central Bank, but gains could be tempered by signs of ongoing weakness in the U.S. labor market.
At 2:20 AM ET (0620 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 1.3% higher. France's CAC 40 futures were up 1.1%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.8%.
The ECB offered up, on Thursday, another massive jolt of stimulus for the region, practically doubling its planned bond purchases to 1.35 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion). Sovereign bond yield spreads narrowed to their tightest since March in reaction.
Bank chief Christine Lagarde said more largesse was needed, given the likely hit to the region’s economies from the social distancing measures put in place to combat the Covid-19 outbreak. 
""The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections see growth declining at an unprecedented pace in the second quarter of this year before rebounding again in the second half, crucially helped by the sizeable support from fiscal and monetary policy.”
This “decision should dent any future speculation about whether or not the ECB is willing to play its role of lender of last resort for the Eurozone,” said analysts at ING, in a research note.
Still,Thursday’s claims data showed the U.S. labor market is taking longer than expected to bounce back from the pandemic, and thus a degree of caution may be needed ahead of the employment report, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). 
The unemployment rate for May is projected to rise to 19.8% from 14.7% in April, while nonfarm payrolls are estimated to have dropped another 8 million in the month.  
In corporate news, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) will be in the spotlight after an announcement that it will leave Germany's DAX index as of June 22, moving into the second-tier MDAX index, to be replaced by residential landlord Deutsche Wohnen (DE:DWNG).
Oil prices edged higher Friday, but uncertainty still exists as to whether OPEC will commit to extending future production cuts after the current cuts expire at the end of June.

596,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>","Singapore bank deposits jump as Hong Kong, virus sow uncertainty","By Aradhana Aravindan and Anshuman Daga
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A record flow of money poured into Singapore bank accounts in April as the COVID-19 pandemic rocked world economies, the latest in a stream of foreign cash that the city-state said has included deposits from rival financial centre Hong Kong.
Singapore typically attracts capital flows during regional turmoil due to its political stability and AAA credit rating, a status that has been galvanised by political uncertainty and social unrest in Asia's other premier wealth centre, Hong Kong.
Deposits from nonresidents into the city-state's banks jumped 44% to a record S$62.14 billion ($44.37 billion) in April from a year earlier, marking the fourth straight monthly rise, central bank data showed.
The Monetary Authority of Singapore told Reuters in a statement that since mid-2019 there has been a broad-based increase of flows into Singapore by non-residents from multiple jurisdictions, including Hong Kong.
""These flows have become more volatile in recent months due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting market fluctuations,"" the central bank said.
Deposits have risen in all but one month over the past year, a period marked by escalating political unrest in Hong Kong, a U.S.-China trade row and the outbreak of the pandemic.
The data did not break down the origin of the inflows, but analysts pointed to the turbulence in Hong Kong.
""Hong Kong has been a source of funds for obvious reasons,"" said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking. He added the pandemic and pressure on regional currencies had also fed fears of a currency crisis and capital flight.
The data also showed foreign-currency deposits at banks in Singapore almost quadrupled to a record S$27 billion in April from a year earlier. They were up nearly 200% in the first four months of 2020 from the same period last year. 
Non-resident deposits include funds from individuals and companies with registered addresses outside the city-state. Analysts say that while the data gives only a partial picture of flows, it is seen as a good gauge of market sentiment.
Safe haven flows into Singapore should continue as long as regional uncertainties, such as those in Hong Kong and U.S.-China trade tensions, persist, said Andrea Choong, an analyst at CGS-CIMB Securities.

597,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 01:05AM ET</span>",Australia shakes up foreign investment laws for national security,"By Kirsty Needham and Melanie Burton
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia announced the biggest shakeup of its foreign investment rules in almost half a century on Friday, including additional powers to force the divestment of a business if it creates a national security risk.
Citing the need to balance economic and national security, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said all foreign investors will face greater scrutiny when bidding for sensitive assets, regardless of the size of the deal and whether the buyer is private or state-owned.
""Technology has been evolving and our geopolitical climate has become more complex,"" Frydenberg said in Canberra. ""In fact, the world over, governments are seeing foreign investment being used for strategic objectives not purely commercial ones.""
In one major change, the Treasurer will be given a last-resort power to vary or to impose conditions on a deal or force a divestment. A Treasury document said the power would not retrospective. 
Frydenberg did not provide full details of which business sectors would be targeted under the changes, which will be made public in the next few weeks, but he did give some indication of areas of interest.
The definition of a national security business would likely cover telecommunication companies, energy and utilities businesses, the defence supply chain, and businesses that collect, store and own data deemed critical to Australia's national security and defence, he said. 
The changes, the biggest overhaul of foreign investment policy since the current framework was established in 1975, will effectively make permanent a temporary tightening of foreign investment regulations announced in March to prevent fire sales of distressed assets during the coronavirus crisis.
Under current laws, most private investments under A$275 million ($190.8 million) are not screened, while the threshold is A$1.2 billion for companies from countries such as China which have free trade agreements with Australia. The threshold is zero for state-owned enterprises.
Frydenberg did not single out China, or any other country, when announcing the overhaul but the Chinese government has in the past raised concerns with Australia about changes to foreign investment rules.
Chinese companies have been major investors in Australian resources, agriculture and property.
Public disquiet over the sale of the Port of Darwin in 2016 to Chinese company Landbridge prompted a rule change to require approval from the country's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) for critical infrastructure deals.
China dropped from second to fifth in the list of countries providing the largest sources of approved foreign investment in Australia for 2018-2019. The United States was first, followed by Canada, Singapore and Japan in 2018-2019. Chinese investment fell by almost 50% to $13.1 billion ($8.4 billion) in 2019.
The government plans to release a draft of the new rules by July for industry consultation before they are implemented on Jan. 1, 2021.

Investing.com – Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) filed a preliminary prospectus for its secondary listing in Hong Kong earlier in the day, the next step after filing a confidential application in April.
JD.com listed on the NASDAQ board in 2014, raising $77.2 billion. Its U.S. stocks were down 0.37% to $56.52 at market close on June 4 ahead of the filing of the prospectus.
The company plans to raise between 4% to 5% of its market capitalization, which is between $3.2 to $4 billion based on its U.S. market cap, ahead of the listing. It will launch its offering on Monday and hopes to list the stocks on the HKEx main board by June 18.
JD.com’s offering got a boost after gaming giant NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) priced its own Hong Kong secondary listing at HK$123 (US$15.8701) per share, raising $2.7 billion. NetEase shares are scheduled to debut on June 11.
Both listings come in the wake of rival Alibaba’s homecoming to Hong Kong raised $12.9 billion last year, and the two companies are looking to list before U.S. measures to restrict Chinese listings in U.S. markets come into effect."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese online gaming firm NetEase (O:NTES) raised at least $2.7 billion in a Hong Kong secondary offering, two sources said on Friday, amid doubts that mainland firms can list in New York as Sino-U.S. tensions deepen.
NetEase's deal, the second after  Alibaba  (N:BABA) in 2019, is expected to be one of several large secondary deals in Hong Kong this year.
Its shares were priced at HK$123 ($15.87) each, the sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The company had planned to sell 171.48 million shares, according to an earlier term sheet, and has the option of selling another 25.72 million shares, under a so-called 'greenshoe' option.
The Hong Kong price is equivalent to $396.70 for NetEase's U.S.-listed shares which is a 2% discount to the stock's last closing price of $405.01 on Thursday.
Under the terms of the deal, one American depository receipt (ADR) is worth 25 of the company's Hong Kong shares. 
In its earlier regulatory filings, NetEase said it planned to use the money raised in its Hong Kong listing to fund its international expansion plans.
Charles Li, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388), said on Thursday he expected 2020 to be ""a big year"" for what he called ""returnees"" from U.S. markets. 
The U.S. administration has questioned whether Chinese companies should be able to list in New York as tensions with Beijing rise.
""Today the atmosphere in the U.S. is becoming less friendly and we obviously have fundamentally changed many aspects of our listing regime so that we are becoming more accommodating,"" he said via webcast at an industry conference held by Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR). 
Chinese e-commerce company JD (NASDAQ:JD).com is due to launch its Hong Kong listing as early as Friday, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, to sell up to 5% of its stock to raise at least $3 billion.
Shares of Netease debut on June 11.
NetEase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Friday morning, with a months-long rally starting to fizzle out.

“We’re probably going to see more of a plateauing, more of trading in a range until there’s a catalyst that moves them forward.”
Investors are also monitoring U.S.-China relations, which continue to simmer in the background. The U.S. Senate on Thursday debated possible sanctions against Chinese entities involved with the national security laws for Hong Kong and Macau.

(Reuters) - An email by a  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) employee about his experiences of racial injustice and criticizing managers at the Wall Street bank for not supporting junior bankers from diverse backgrounds went viral at the firm this week.
The email by Frederick Baba, a managing director at the bank who is black, coincides with other Wall Street executives and companies speaking out against racial inequality after the death of an African American man, George Floyd, during an arrest by a white police officer who held a knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25.
On Tuesday, Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) pledged $1 billion to help communities address economic and racial inequality. Goldman Sachs on Wednesday created a $10 million fund for racial equity. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) have also made statements denouncing racism and discrimination.
Baba, who works in Goldman's electronic trading business, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), initially sent the email with the subject line ""How it's going..."" to a group of bankers he works with on June 2 after Floyd's death led to sometimes violent protests across the United States.
But the letter ended up being so widely forwarded that it was seen by almost everyone at the bank - which employs around 38,000 people globally - including CEO David Solomon, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
Solomon emailed Baba with a personal note in response, the person said without elaborating on what Solomon wrote. The letter has been posted on Goldman's internal website, the person said. 
""To everyone who's asked me some variant of ""how's it going?"" over the past month, I've probably lied. Or lacked the words to articulate it fully, but I’m giving it a shot,"" Baba wrote in the email seen by Reuters.
""...the past few months have been demoralizing, and family/friends/colleagues I've spoken with and listened to across the firm and country seem to share this feeling,"" he wrote, going on to mention minorities hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Baba goes on to draw a detailed account of his experiences witnessing and being subjected to racial discrimination and aggression, including a 2011 encounter with Chicago police. Baba said the Chicago police slammed him against the hood of a cruiser because he matched the generic description of a black man wearing a t-shirt and shorts.
""I went home and I cried for the first time in years,"" he wrote. 
At the end of the letter, Baba calls on his colleagues to take action to counter racial inequality, including at work. 
""A common bit of feedback from our junior colleagues is that while our firm expresses a commitment to equality and social justice up top, they don't necessarily see commitment and support from their direct managers ... I'll be okay; look after them,"" he wrote. 
Reuters contacted Baba and Goldman Sachs on Thursday to verify the contents of the email. Baba referred Reuters to a spokesman for the bank because he is not authorized to speak to the press.

""Thanks for reaching out and creating a forum to discuss these critical issues,"" he added.

(Reuters) - Broadcom Inc (O:AVGO) on Thursday forecast current-quarter revenue with a midpoint slightly below analysts' estimates, in part caused by a delay at a ""large North American mobile phone"" customer that analysts believe is Apple Inc (O:AAPL). 
The company forecast fiscal third-quarter revenue of about $5.75 billion, plus or minus $150 million. Analysts on average were expecting $5.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
""We would normally expect to see a double-digit sequential uplift in revenue from the ramp of next-generation phone at our large North American mobile phone customer,"" Chief Executive Hock Tan said on a conference call. ""However, this year, we do not expect to see this uptick in revenue until our fourth fiscal quarter.""
Tan cited a ""major product cycle delay in wireless"" without naming the customer, but Broadcom got about a fifth of its revenue from Apple in its most recent fiscal year and in January entered into to two multi-year agreements worth as much as $15 billion in revenue to supply Apple with wireless components.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Analysts expect the company to release a range of 5G iPhone models later this year, but the Nikkei Asian Review reported in March that Apple was considering delaying the launch due to product development disruptions and the economic turmoil caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
Broadcom reported better-than-expected growth in quarterly revenue, supported by higher demand for chips used in data centers, which are ramping up as more people opt to work from home in the face of the coronavirus crisis.

Broadcom's revenue rose 4% to $5.74 billion in the second quarter ended May 3, beating analysts' average estimate of $5.69 billion.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Thursday launched a feature on its food delivery app Uber Eats that lets customers in the United States and Canada order from restaurants owned by black people and pay no delivery fees for those orders through 2020.
The feature comes in response to U.S.-wide protests over the death of a black man, George Floyd, while in police custody in Minneapolis, which has become the latest flashpoint for rage over police brutality against African Americans and prompted calls to support black communities and businesses in solidarity.
Customers who open the Uber Eats app in major U.S. and Canadian cities will see a banner reading: ""Support Black-owned restaurants,"" and are provided with a list of nearby restaurants.
Delivery fees for those orders are being waived until the end of the year, Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said in a Thursday email to U.S. customers.
The CEO also said that Uber in coming weeks would offer discounted ride-hailing trips to black-owned small businesses that have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Khosrowshahi also committed to making the company more diverse internally. In 2019, some 45% of Uber's U.S. employees were white, 33% Asian, 9% black and 8% Hispanic, a company report showed.
Uber's new food delivery feature is a response to requests from customers, the company said, adding that various Uber employees had compiled the restaurants based on publicly available sources and with input from local organizations and business associations. 

Uber said it did not ask restaurants for information on race when including them on its platform. Restaurants were informed about the initiative ahead of time and can opt out of the program, as well as refer other black-owned restaurants not yet included.

""This is insane @JeffBezos,"" Musk tweeted at Amazon's chief. Both men are billionaires and oversee competing space exploration companies on top of their duties at Telsa and Amazon. ""Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!"" Musk added in a second tweet.
Musk does not have legal authority to break up Amazon.
The retailer had no comment on Musk's call for its dissolution but said the book in question, by author Alex Berenson, had been blocked in error and was now available for sale via its Kindle e-reading service. The decision to greenlight the book's sale was not due to Musk, Amazon said.
The Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) chief, who earlier this month said he would take a break from Twitter, has a history of being outspoken on the social media platform. A tweet in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private led to a lawsuit against Musk by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which the parties later settled. Musk has lashed out about shelter-at-home restrictions to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus as well.
According to a photo of a message Amazon sent Berenson, posted on Twitter, the retailer had taken action because the 22-page book did not comply with guidelines that Amazon did not specify, adding, ""we are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus."" Berenson's book is titled, ""Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 1: Introduction and Death Counts and Estimates.""

Berenson did not respond to an email requesting comment. After Amazon approved the book's sale, he tweeted, ""thanks to @elonmusk and everyone who helped.""

The deal values Reliance’s Jio Platforms Ltd. at an equity value of $65 billion, giving the Abu Dhabi sovereign investment company a stake of 1.85%, according to a statement. Reliance, backed by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, is also in discussions with Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on Wednesday.
The deal adds to the $10 billion that Jio Platforms has raised in recent weeks as it starts early preparations for an overseas stock listing. High-profile backers from  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). to KKR are betting on Jio’s access to India’s 1.35 billion people and its potential to shake up traditional industries in the country -- including retail, education and payments -- with its technology.

The string of investments by technology giants and other investors will go toward Ambani’s stated goal of slashing debt at Reliance Industries. The outside money also helps set a valuation for Jio, which until recently had mainly been owned by the billionaire’s conglomerate, as it prepares for the listing. The deal gives Jio an enterprise value of $68 billion.
Facebook invested $5.7 billion in Jio in April -- a deal that gave the social media company a roughly 10% stake in the Indian business. Facebook is looking to build a commerce business for its WhatsApp messaging service and was eager to work with Jio to take advantage of the company’s JioMart ecommerce platform and its relationship with India merchants. Facebook has a massive presence in India, with more than 400 million WhatsApp users alone, and the two sides had worked together previously when Facebook built a version of its WhatsApp messaging product for a Jio phone in 2018.
Mubadala, which has offices outside Abu Dhabi in San Francisco, New York, Moscow and elsewhere, made a $15 billion commitment to the SoftBank Vision Fund and launched a number of tech funds in the U.S., Europe and its home base. The fund, which has $229 billion in assets, has also been divesting some of its technology and other assets to redeploy proceeds to new investments. Last year, it sold 34.9 million shares in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc. In March, Mubadala helped lead a $2.25 billion investment in Waymo, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s self-driving car unit.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The government-backed Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp said on Thursday it would tighten rules for offering mortgage insurance from July 1, after forecasting declines of between 9% and 18% in home prices over the next 12 months.
The move would make it harder for riskier borrowers, who offer downpayments of less than 20%, to access CMHC's default mortgage insurance. 
CMHC is establishing a minimum credit score of 680 instead of the current 600, the group said in an emailed statement.
It will also limit total gross debt servicing ratios to its standard requirement of 35% of annual income, compared with a threshold as high as 39% currently, and total debt servicing to 42% versus as much as 44% now.
The measures will help curtail ""excessive demand and unsustainable house price growth,"" CMHC Chief Executive Evan Siddall said in the statement.
He said COVID-19 has exposed longstanding financial-market vulnerabilities, and ""we must act now to protect the economic futures of Canadians.""
Some 35% of Canadian banks' mortgages are insured, their financial statements show. CMHC is the top mortgage insurer, while Genworth MI Canada (TO:MIC) and other private companies also provide similar products.
Despite evaporating activity in the housing market due to the COVID-19 pandemic, prices have continued to rise as listings have fallen off alongside demand. 
Home prices across the country rose 1.3% in April from March, and data from Toronto and Vancouver real estate boards showed increases of 3% and 2.9% in May, respectively, from a year earlier.
The CMHC has taken a more bearish view of the housing market than others. Last week, some of Canada's biggest banks forecast maximum price declines of about 7%.

Siddall last week responded to critics of its more dire outlook, saying on Twitter they were ""whistling past the graveyard and offering no analysis."" (https://

LONDON (LPC) - The UK government could face hefty losses on loans made to struggling businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic due to its new insolvency law that can force lenders to accept unfavourable terms during a debt restructuring process. 
The new ‘Restructuring Plan', part of the government's Corporate Insolvency & Governance Bill being debated in parliament this week, empowers one class of creditors to force a debt restructuring plan on another class of creditors, in what is known as a cross class cramdown.  
It therefore gives a majority of creditors the power to force a debt restructuring onto a single class of creditors who do not agree with it. 
This could result in the government having to accept debt write offs on Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans (CBILs) and Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loans (CLBILs), which are 80% guaranteed by the government. 
“We expect to see restructurings in the second half of the year that include these (government guaranteed) bank loans,” said one restructuring lawyer. “Under the new laws you can now cram down a single class -- it would be ironic if this class was these loans.” 
The new law requires 75% of lenders, based on value across all the classes, to approve a debt restructuring. This is a far lower hurdle to overcome than the current UK scheme of arrangement system, which requires 75% by value and 50% of creditors in each class to approve the plan before it goes to court. The new law has the ability to cram down a dissenting class unlike the old system. 
    
SUSCEPTIBLE
Some £8.9bn of CBILs were approved by the end of May, providing small and medium-sized businesses with loans of up to £5m each. The vast majority of the loans are unsecured and sit lower down the capital structure, making them susceptible to the will of higher-ranking lenders. 
“There is no carve-out in the bill for CBIL loans, and so yes, they could be written down as part of a restructuring. The bank that provided the CBIL loan would be able to rely on the government for a shortfall of up to 80% of the loan,” a second lawyer said.
The loans could be written off completely or they could end up as part of a debt for equity plan, with the government left holding equity stakes in businesses.
“I think a lot of CBILs will be converted into equity – the government could end up the largest minority equity holder in the UK,” a second lawyer said. 
    
SLOW TAKE UP
CLBILs, which provide larger corporates with loans of up to £200m, will mainly be secured. As they will rank on an equal basis to existing senior secured lenders, the debt is less likely to be crammed down. 
However, the situation is complicated by the fact that existing senior secured lenders have to agree to a dilution of their security when a company takes a CLBIL. Restructuring advisers believe this is why the take up of these loans has been so low, with only 154 agreed so far. 
It could also create a more complicated restructuring process where senior secured lenders become pitted against each other.
“Normally secured lenders would form one class in a restructuring, but there is scope for gerrymandering where some secured lenders form a different class and try to override another,” a third restructuring lawyer said.
Under the new bill, there are some safe guards against this as a court has to be satisfied that none of the dissenting classes would be any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of an alternative process such as a liquidation.
However, the final approval of the plan lies with the judge. 

“It is a bit of a blunt instrument as it is. It will come down to how competent a judge is in understanding what is fair and what the motivations are of the different classes of creditors,” a fourth restructuring lawyer said.

The offer is preliminary and was submitted to Oxford Immunotec in the last few days, the sources said. It comes after the company explored a potential sale to large healthcare peers over the course of the last year, but failed to agree on terms, the sources added.
KKR and Ampersand Capital have proposed to acquire Oxford Immunotec for around $15 per share in cash, subject to due diligence, the sources said. There is no certainty that the offer will lead to a deal, the sources added.
The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Oxford Immunotec, KKR and Ambersand did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Oxford Immunotec sells its tuberculosis test kits and associated accessories to laboratories that perform the testing themselves. It also has a clinical testing laboratory in Britain where it performs the tests on samples sent in by clients.
Its customers include independent laboratories, large hospital systems and public and private institutions.
Oxford Immunities so-called T-SPOT.TB test measures antigen-specific T cells indicative of a tuberculosis infection. About 23% of the world's population, or about 1.7 billion people, are infected with the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, according to the World Health Organization. 
Oxford Immunotec listed on the Nasdaq in 2013. Its shares ended trading on Thursday at $12.96. In 2018, the company sold its laboratory services business to Quest Diagnostics Inc (N:DGX) for gross proceeds of $170 million in cash.

Last month, Oxford Immunotec released a test for T cells to be used by researchers studying immunity to COVID-19.

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) shares jumped more than 40% on Thursday after announcing a big boost to U.S. flights next month following dramatic cuts caused by the coronavirus pandemic, as well as some leadership changes to cut costs.
American shares ended up 41% at $16.72 on the bullish announcement in very heavy trading, though still down 45% since mid-February.
The stock had lost more than its peers due to its higher debt load and fears of a sluggish recovery. While analysts cheered signs leisure demand is picking up, they warned that business and international travel could remain depressed for around three years.
American, the largest U.S. carrier, also announced on Thursday the outcome of an early out program for management, saying 14 officers will be leaving the company. 
""As we plan for a post-coronavirus recovery, we know we will be living with the effects of the pandemic for some time,"" American Chief Executive Doug Parker said in a memo to employees.
Still, the airline will fly more than 55% of its July 2019 domestic capacity next month and also boost its international flights schedule, flying nearly 20% of its July 2019 schedule.
By comparison, American flew just 20% of its domestic schedule in May and is flying 25% in June, said Vasu Raja, American Airlines' senior vice president of network strategy.
""As an airline, we've consciously bet on demand coming back. We have bet the economy,"" Raja said, noting American has been operating a larger schedule than U.S. rivals. 
Raja told Reuters the airline would fly just over 4,000 flights on peak days in July compared with nearly 2,000 on peak days in May. That is still down from the peak 6,800 daily flights before the crisis.
Other U.S. and foreign carriers are also adding flights to summer schedules as demand increases.
In total, American plans to fly 40% of July 2019 capacity, boosting flights from New York City airports, Los Angeles and Washington as well as its Dallas Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs. It is also increasing flights to major cities in Florida, Gulf Coast cities and mountain destinations as national parks and outdoor recreational spaces reopen. 

American plans to resume service to additional European and Latin American destinations in August, and to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from Miami on July 7.

613,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 04:46PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for June 5,"By Liz Moyer 
Investing.com -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its uphill climb Thursday, even though new employment data revealed the pace of economic recovery may not be as quick as hoped.
The blue chip index staged a four-day rally this week, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite reached an intraday high before falling back on Thursday. But stocks have recovered much of their losses since mass business shutdowns began in March.
Optimism has fueled the indexes higher in recent days as states and cities gradually lift work and recreation restrictions. A fresh slate of employment data and earnings are expected on Friday.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Yet Another Round of Jobs Data
Another batch of job and wage news expected out Friday, including the unemployment rate for May, which is projected to rise to 19.8% from 14.7% in April.
The employment report comes out at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
The sharp jump comes after a period when unemployment had reached 50-year lows. But business shutdowns because of the Covid-19 virus sparked a sudden and catastrophic loss of economic activity in March that is continuing to work itself out even as the restrictions ease.
The report will also provide insights on the degree to which various sectors felt the pain. In the last report, the highest number of job losses were in the leisure and hospitality industries and education and health services.
2. Nonfarm Payroll Numbers Expected to Improve
While better than feared job numbers already came out this week from payroll services provider ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) and the Labor Department, the enormity of the job losses is still staggering.
On Friday, the numbers for nonfarm payrolls in May will be released. The estimate is for a loss of another 8 million, but that is an improvement from the 20 million decline reported for April.
3. Tribune Publishing to Release Earnings After Delay
Tribune Publishing (NASDAQ:TPCO) is expected to report profit of 15 cents a share on revenue of $212 million after delaying its announcement two weeks.
In May, the publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun said it needed the extra time to assess the valuation of assets and figure out whether it needed to record a noncash impairment, mainly due to the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The shares are down 24.7% this year."

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 lost ground on Thursday as investors took profits in advance of Friday's jobs report, ending a four-day rally driven by rising economic sentiment.
The Nasdaq joined the S&P 500 in negative territory, while the blue-chip Dow posted a nominal gain.
""We were pretty overvalued going into this week,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer, Independent Advisor Alliance, Charlotte, NC. ""It's not surprising to see a pullback.""
Still, all three major indexes have shown remarkable resilience since their late March plunge, with the Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and the Dow about 2%, 8% and 11% below their respective record highs reached in February.
""This market has gone up so far so fast there's a lot of people saying, 'I'm going to take a little profit,'"" said Jim Paulson, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. 
Economic data showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits dipped below 2 million for the first time since mid-March, and plummeting international commerce resulted in a net widening of the U.S. trade gap.
Friday's much-anticipated jobs report from the Labor Department is expected to show the U.S. unemployment rate sky-rocketing to a historic 19.7%.

Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but financials, industrials and materials were in the red in a continuation of a rotation in cyclicals.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc announced it would beef up its flight schedule in July to 55% of its year-ago capacity as the U.S. economy reopens, sending its shares soaring 41.2%.
The hard-hit commercial airline industry also jumped on the news, with the ARCA Airline index gaining 10.1%.
Global online commerce platform EBay Inc rose 6.3% after raising current quarter forecasts due to a surge in customer orders.
The Department of Justice gave anti-trust approval for  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp's purchase of TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) Holding Corp, sending their shares up 5.5% and 9.0%, respectively.
J.M. Smucker Co fell 4.8% after the packaged food company forecast a decline in full-year sales.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.08-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 52 new highs and 10 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 14.46 billion shares, compared with the 11.68 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com - Broadcom on Thursday reported fiscal second-quarter results that topped expectations, but the chipmaker warned that supply chain issues and an expected ""substantial reset"" in wireless would dent third-quarter growth.
Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares lost 1.18% in after-hours trade following the report.
Broadcom expects third-quarter revenue of $5.75 billion, give or take $150 million, just below consensus of $5.78 billion in the upcoming quarter.
""Our third-quarter guidance for semiconductors reflects a surge in demand from cloud, telecom and enterprise customers, offset by supply chain constraints and an expected substantial reset,"" the company said.

Investing.com – The Dow notched its fourth-straight day of gains Thursday after cutting losses into the close as data showing the labor market is taking longer to bounce back from the pandemic impact did little to cool reopening optimism.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.05%, or 12 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.34%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.69%.
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits continues to decline, but a deeper look into the data suggests that hopes the jobs market had bottomed may have been somewhat optimistic.
Initial jobless claims fell to 1.877 million for the week ended May 29, from 2.1 million the prior week, but missed forecasts of 1.8 million, Continuing jobless claims, however, unexpectedly rose to 21.5 million from 20.8 million the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday,   
Many have been expecting the job situation to ""stabilize and snapback in June, but the sticky high level of initial claims, elevated continuing claims, and the rise in claims for the Pandemic Assistance Program program suggest that even June might be too early for the expected turnaround,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Sectors sensitive to the economic recovery, such as financials and industrials, remained well supported, sidestepping the broader market decline.
The optimism over the progress on reopening the economy has been underscored in the bond market, which for weeks had been signaling that the surge in appetite for risk had been overdone.
The yield on the United States 10-Year rose above 0.80% to a more-than-two-month high, helping banks catch a bid.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) continued to climb, with latter up more than 4%.
Sentiment on the aviation sector improved, meanwhile, after American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) said it plans to fly 55% of its domestic schedule in July, up from May when the airline flew just 20% of its capacity from a year ago, sending its shares up 44%.
But technology lagged the rally, with investors seemingly wary of frothy valuations on display following the sector's surge since the lows seen in March.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) traded below the flatline.

The British company, which has already flagged a need for additional funds to ride out the pandemic, also said it intends to raise 120 million pounds ($151.30 million) through share sale and additional loans.
Stobart has been hurt by a drop in airport traffic due to travel restrictions in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. Its woes have been exacerbated by a hit from regional airline Flybe's collapse and underperformance of the rail and civils division.
The unit, which provides specialist rail and non-rail civil engineering and management services, posted 21% fall in revenue for the year ended Feb 29, and Stobart said the business was unlikely to generate ""an appropriate return for shareholders"".
The London-listed firm said it would focus on its aviation business, which has built airports including London's Southend and provides ground handling and check-in services for airlines.
""We will focus our investment and our business in this asset (aviation business) by seeking to dispose of our non-core businesses and, in due course, monetise Stobart Energy,"" Chief Executive Officer Warwick Brady (NYSE:BRC) said.
Pretax loss widened to 158 million pounds from 42.1 million pounds due to a 17% jump in operating costs and declining value of some assets. Revenue, however, was up 16%. 
Flybe is owned by Connect Airways - formed by Stobart, Virgin Atlantic and investment adviser Cyrus Capital.

His comments come after his firm, GMO, said it was slashing its exposure to equities. GMO reduced the net equity exposure in its Benchmark-Free Allocation Strategy to 25% from around 55%%, said Ben Inker, head of asset allocation, in a quarterly report Thursday that included a note from Grantham.
“We have never lived in a period where the future was so uncertain,” Grantham, 81, wrote. “The key here is uncertainty, which in some ways seems the highest in my experience.”
The legendary money manager, who co-founded Boston-based GMO and is its long-term investment strategist, said that the price-to-earnings ratio for stocks is now in the top 10% historically, while the U.S. economy is in the worst 10%, or perhaps the worst 1%.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund WorldQuant hired computer scientist Yoram Singer, a former principal scientist at Google (O:GOOGL), as its chief AI scientist as Wall Street races to use machine learning to decipher trading signals, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Singer, a professor of computer science at Princeton, will join WorldQuant later this month and be based in San Francisco. At Princeton Singer helped lead an artificial intelligence research lab run by the university and Google, where he worked from 2005 to 2019.
Singer could not be reached for comment.
Singer's position at WorldQuant is a new one and illustrates how computer-driven asset management firms are trying to tap into artificial intelligence and machine learning to untangle reams of data and place potentially lucrative bets.
Thirteen years ago Igor Tulchinsky founded WorldQuant after having spent a dozen years as a portfolio manager at hedge fund Millennium Management. Today, WorldQuant invests more than $7 billion in assets for investors including Millennium and others.
Quantitative trading has become a hot area on Wall Street over the last years and its hedge funds fared better than stock picking firms during this year's market sell-off. The average quantitative hedge fund lost 5.25% in the first four months of 2020 while the average hedge fund lost 6.56% during the same time, data from Hedge Fund Research shows.
Singer's hire comes only weeks after WorldQuant hired former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) executive Gary Chropuvka, who had been co-head of the bank's quantitative investment strategies, as president.

The suspension, in place since March, can be applied on bank loans to companies and individuals, including on household mortgages.
Finance Minister Mario Centeno said last month that the scheme, originally due to expire in September, had already led to the postponement of 12 billion euros in interest and capital payments, and that the government would extend it as needed to avoid jeopardising the banking system with a jump in bad loans.
Top executives of the five largest banks in Portugal, which together control over 80% of the country's banking system assets, had already requested this extension.
Portugal, which saw a sharp increase in bad loans after its 2010-2013 economic and debt crisis, is expected to suffer a steep economic contraction this year.
Since the last crisis, Portuguese banks reduced non-performing loans to 17.2 billion euros ($18.7 billion) in December 2019 from a peak of 50 billion euros in June 2016. Still, its NPL ratio of 6.1% of total credit was about twice the European average.

634,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Nasdaq head says SEC needs to address overseas accounting issues,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Regulators need to address transparency and accounting issues at companies based in foreign jurisdictions that are looking to go public through the U.S. markets, Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) Chief Executive Adena Friedman said on Thursday. 
Nasdaq recently proposed new restrictions on initial public offerings, which if approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), would make it harder for some Chinese companies to debut on the Nasdaq.
The new rules, which include greater scrutiny of the audit firms of overseas companies it lists, will help Nasdaq ensure those firms meet its standards, Friedman said at an industry conference held by Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR).
Oversight of audit firms is led by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which are prevented from inspecting audit work papers in China.
""The broader issue though is this issue of disclosure and PCAOB oversight of the audit firms and I think that's an issue for the SEC to address,"" Friedman said.
U.S. investors have in recent years increased their exposure to emerging markets, including China, bringing accounting disclosure shortcomings to light. 
That prompted the SEC on May 4 to announce a roundtable on oversight issues of U.S.-listed foreign companies. No date has been given for the event.
The U.S. Senate passed legislation on May 20 that could prevent some Chinese companies from listing shares on U.S. exchanges unless they follow standards for U.S. audits and regulations. The bipartisan measure still must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by the president to become law.

The head of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388) said earlier on Thursday at the Piper Sandler conference that many U.S.-listed Chinese firms would not qualify to list on his exchange, but many ""great companies"" listed in America were now looking to list in Hong Kong.

636,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",France budgets 40 billion euros for crisis-hit industries,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French government will mobilise 40 billion euros ($45 billion) to support industries the hardest hit by the coronavirus crisis as part of a response that will push debt to record levels, finance ministry officials said on Thursday.
The money, made up mainly of fresh spending and loans, is to be used for sector-support plans for tourism, the automobile, aerospace and tech industries, the officials said.
The funds are part of an update to the 2020 budget the government is to present on Wednesday, which budget minister Gerald Darmanin said would give a record public sector budget deficit of 11.4% of economic output, revised up from 9% only a few months ago.
The government has had little choice but to increase the deficit as the euro zone's second-biggest economy plunged into its worse post-war recession with gross domestic product expected to contract 11% this year.
As a result, the national debt was expected to swell to an unprecedented 120.9% of economic output, one French official said, adding that European Central Bank bond purchases were helping to contain the cost of increased borrowing.
""We are lucky to be able to take on long-term debt at low rates,"" the source said. ""The time will come when we have to improve our public finances because the accumulated debt will have to be reduced and that will happen mainly by the return of growth.""
Wednesday's budget update, the third since the coronavirus crisis swept into France in March, foresees fresh spending of 13 billion euros, including an extra 5 billion for state-subsidised furloughs, which have covered 13 million people so far. 
The government has already announced plans for the tourism and automobile industries and measures for the tech industry are due on Friday with aerospace to follow next week.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",U.S. banks attract bargain hunters though hurdles to growth remain,"By Sinéad Carew
(Reuters) - Investors eyeing a turnaround in the U.S. economy are piling into U.S. bank stocks even as some caution that positive stress test results and an abatement of loan losses will be needed to sustain a rally in the battered sector.
The S&P 500 bank index <.SPXBK> has kicked off June with an advance of close to 10% so far, following a two-day rally of 15% last week. Banks are sensitive to consumer and business spending so the stocks were slammed by the coronavirus-related economic slump. 
As U.S. Treasury yields rose on Thursday, the bank index was up another 1.8%. This added to the previous session's 5% gain after U.S. May private payrolls declined less than expected, suggesting that layoffs were abating as businesses reopened and stay-at-home restrictions related to COVID-19 eased.
Banks have also been helped by renewed interest in value stocks over growth investments. Optimistic comments from banks had helped the sector last week, including JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's forecast that reserve increases for loan default protection could taper in the third and fourth quarter.
Second-quarter earnings are expected to be bleak and investors are eagerly waiting the completion of annual stress test, due by June 30, as the results determine how much capital banks can return to shareholders. 
But some portfolio managers are already betting on 2021 earnings improvements, assuming banks have shouldered most of the economic cycle's loss-reserve increases by then.
""There's optimism things will be better a year from now. And because banks have trailed just about everything else in the market they're being dragged up,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, in New Vernon, New Jersey. 
Even after the current rally, the S&P bank index is one of the biggest industry laggards this year with a 29% decline, compared to the S&P 500's (SPX) more than 3% drop.
There are concerns dividends could be suspended if the Federal Reserve requires more capital reserves after the stress test, said Michael Cronin, investment manager for US equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 
""Banks seem optimistic they'll be able to continue to pay dividends and they're advocating for paying dividends but the question is still out there and it's still weighing on valuations,"" said Cronin.
(Graphic: S&P 500 bank valuations fall well below historical average - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnpwyjxzpw/bankvaluationmay2020.PNG)
The banks sector's forward price-to-book ratio, comparing prices to book value estimates, tumbled starting in February as the coronavirus pandemic scared off investors. In April, it hit a trough of 0.72 - the sector's lowest valuation since the 2009 financial crisis.
The ratio has since risen to 0.81 but still looks like a bargain to money managers versus the historic average of 1.22.
""A lot of the negativity is reflected in current valuations, which is why there's a lot of upside compared with other industries"" said Ryan Lentell, portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management.
Cronin at Aberdeen Standard is still watching the direction of credit costs, which will depend on whether there is a second wave of coronavirus cases and more lockdowns.
""Until we get some clarity on the stress tests and credit, it'll be a lot harder to move materially higher in the near term,"" said Cronin.
U.S. fiscal stimulus and Federal Reserve support, including interest rate cuts, appear to have put a ""backstop"" behind bank balance sheets, according to Fred Cannon, head of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. 
Banks have also been boosted by a rotation into value stocks with the S&P 500 Value index (IVX) gaining more than 11% since mid-May, compared with an almost 7% gain for the S&P 500 value index (IGX). 
But Cannon questions how sustainable the rotation will be. And since bank profits depend partly on higher interest rates, Cannon sees a limit to gains in the sector. 

""Interest rates will remain low for a very long time. It's very difficult to see banks regain their pre-crisis levels until there's some sign interest rates will increase,"" he said.

The company said it was increasing its domestic flying schedule for the summer travel season because of improving demand. Airlines have been struggling over the last few months because of a severe decline in travelers amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Now, American is planning to fly more than 55% of its July 2019 domestic capacity and plans to fly nearly 20% of its July 2019 international schedule. By comparison, American flew just 20% of its domestic schedule in May and is flying 25% in June.

The airline is boosting flights from New York City airports, Los Angeles and Washington and adding flights from its Dallas Fort Worth and Charlotte hubs according to Reuters. It is also boosting flights to major cities in Florida, Gulf Coast cities and mountain destinations as national parks and outdoor recreational spaces reopen.

639,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>","Tech stocks have been a winning bet, but investors worry it will fade","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A bet on tech companies has been a solid one in the aftermath of the coronavirus-induced market crash, but some investors are questioning whether those stocks can maintain their momentum if jobs do not recover soon. 
Less than three months after the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus spurred unprecedented lockdowns across the United States, pushing the unemployment rate to levels not seen since the Great Depression, the Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) on Thursday briefly notched a new intraday high, making it the first major stock benchmark to post new highs since the crash. 
With more than 75% of the weight of the full Nasdaq Composite among its constituents, the Nasdaq 100 is the benchmark for the popular Invesco ETF QQQ (O:QQQ), the 5th-largest equity ETF with more than $108 billion in assets, according to Lipper. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC), meanwhile, remains about 2% below its record close.
Yet while the pandemic has benefited technology companies - and their investors - by driving greater adaptation of ecommerce, remote work and cloud computing, for instance, the risk is that the slowdown in the real economy will soon catch up to the gains. 
""No matter who you are, you need healthy customers who have a budget to pay you,"" said Kevin Landis, portfolio manager of the Firsthand Funds, who expects companies he holds such as streaming firm  Roku  Inc (O:ROKU) and online education company  Chegg Inc  (N:CHGG) to struggle to expand if unemployment remains high. ""If the overall economy suffers that is going to take some steam out of the tech companies eventually."" 
So far, the Nasdaq Composite has proven more resilient than other broad market benchmarks, in part because it has little exposure to sectors such as energy, retail and travel companies whose shares have cratered 50% or more since the start of the year. The S&P is around 8% below its own all-time closing high, hit on Feb. 19. 
In addition, cash-rich technology companies have become a safety play during a time of market turmoil, crowding investors into a small number of stocks such as Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Microsoft Inc (O:MSFT) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL), said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. 
""Owning tech in this environment is considered not speculative but safer than consumer brands that would have traditionally been safe,"" said Cox, adding that many large technology companies now pay attractive dividends.
A number of well-known companies, including Amazon,  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and  Zoom Video Communications  (O:ZM), have already soared past the highs they notched before the coronavirus crisis. 
RISING RISKS
The impact of a sustained slowdown in the economy has so far been masked by widespread expectations of further stimulus measures from Congress or the Federal Reserve, said Jim Callinan, portfolio manager of Osterweis Emerging Opportunity Fund, leaving the Nasdaq primed for an outsized fall if those measures fail to materialize. 
""We really need to make sure that consumers are okay and feeling good within their economic viability,"" Callinan said.
With the valuation of technology stocks stretched overall, investors should gravitate toward companies that rely less on the direction of the economy, said Mike Lippert, a portfolio manager of the Baron Opportunity Fund. 
Lippert has been adding to companies such as cybersecurity firm  Crowdstrike Holdings Inc  (O:CRWD) and cloud communications firm RingCentral Inc (N:RNG) that are likely to be adopted by businesses regardless of the broader consumer backdrop. 
Brian Jacobsen, a senior investment strategist for the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management Multi-Asset Solutions team, said his firm remains long on the Nasdaq while shorting the S&P 500. Still, he is cautious that economic demand may start to slow. 
""Businesses are feeling pressure to invest in technology as employees who are accustomed to working from home will want to continue doing so with better in-home set-ups,"" he said. ""But at some point there needs to be an economic turnaround to justify the spend.""

The state-guaranteed loan has drawn criticism in Italy because FCA, which has moved its legal headquarters to the Netherlands, is working towards a merger with French carmaker PSA (PA:PEUP). 
Italy is set to provide guarantees on 80% of the loan through credit export agency SACE under an emergency liquidity package adopted to help companies weather the coronavirus crisis.
Speaking on Corriere TV, Intesa CEO Carlo Messina said the loan was essential to protect a sector which accounts for 6% of Italy's national output because, under the terms of the loan, FCA will use the money to pay employees and suppliers, as well as finance investments in the country.
""With this transaction we're supporting a key sector of the economy, its suppliers and employment,"" Messina said.
""It's a key plank (of efforts) to safeguard (the economy in) the current phase, if we don't support sectors which are crucial for GDP such as automotive and construction ... instead of a 10% GDP contraction we'll have a 15% drop,"" he said. 

Messina said to ensure that conditions set for the loan were met the money would be disbursed through dedicated current accounts which would be used exclusively to pay staff, suppliers and to finance investments.

LONDON (Reuters) - The ratio of leveraged loan credit rating downgrades to upgrades has spiked to a record level five times above that hit during the last global financial crisis, reflecting the unprecedented stress in risky assets due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Leveraged loans - taken out by companies that have high levels of debt, usually with non-investment grade credit ratings - tend to be used by private equity firms as a way to fund acquisitions of such companies.
The U.S. leveraged lending market has grown to more than $2 trillion, up 80% since the early 2010s, according to credit rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
The downgrade-to-upgrade ratio in S&P's LSTA Leveraged Loan index hit 43.20 in the U.S. in May, well above the peak of around 8.45 in January 2009, according to data from S&P Global's LCD.
In Europe, the ratio hit 56.00 in April before easing to 37.00 in May, but that is still nearly four times higher than at the start of this year and more than ten times higher than a peak of 3.00 during the euro zone debt crisis. 
""In post world war history economic activity has never been scaled down to such a large degree in such a short amount of time,"" said Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) credit strategist Cem Keltek, stressing the unprecedented downgrade pressure across the entire corporate debt universe, be it bonds or loans. 
The data illustrates why credit markets are worried about a ripple effect from loan defaults. 
Leveraged loans can be packaged into collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), which then issue bonds and pay bondholders using cashflows from the loans. A flurry of defaults could push CLO tranches into default too. CLOs have been a key factor behind the increase issuance of these risky loans over the last decade.

Soaring online demand has boosted performance of e-commerce companies as well as helped traditional retailers' businesses.
While Walmart (N:WMT) and  Target  (N:TGT), which also sell essential goods, recorded their best online sales in years, specialty retailers American Eagle (N:AEO) and  Best Buy  (N:BBY) sold more online as stores remained closed during lockdowns.

The company said revenue in classifieds were performing at the high end of estimates. It said in February it was looking at multiple candidates for a potential sale of the unit.
EBay said its full-year performance will likely be above the range it forecast earlier. In April, it estimated full-year revenue between $9.56 billion and $9.76 billion. 
It expects second-quarter revenue to be between $2.75 billion and $2.80 billion, compared with earlier estimates of $2.38 billion to $2.48 billion. 
It also raised its adjusted profit forecast to between $1.02 and $1.06 per share from an earlier range of $0.73 to $0.80 per share. 

Shares of the company rose as much as 11.6% to an all-time high of $51.88 in early trading.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators are set to warn Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica that its 7.2 billion euro ($8.1 billion) bid for opticians group GrandVision may harm competition, people familiar with the matter said, pressuring the group to offer concessions.
EssilorLuxottica (PA:ESLX), formed last year from the merger of French lens maker Essilor and Italian eyewear group Luxottica, also owns the Oakley and Persol brands and Varilux lenses.
The deal would give the group control of more than 7,000 GrandVision outlets across the world 
The European Commission will send a statement of objections outlining its concerns in the coming days, the people said, a move which typically ratchets up the pressure on companies to offer concessions to allay competition concerns.
The EU competition enforcer, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Aug. 13, and GrandVision declined to comment. EssilorLuxottica was not immediately available to comment.
Retailers and rival lens makers have expressed concerns to the EU antitrust watchdog, other sources have told Reuters. The Commission has zoomed in on the British and Italian markets by asking independent retailers for feedback.
EssilorLuxottica however argues that independent and specialist lens makers have shown growing market clout.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) said on Thursday that the accord resolves charges that defective procedures at the bank's Merrill Lynch unit caused customers holding 13,328 accounts to incur unnecessary sales charges and fees from April 2011 to April 2017.
FINRA said some eligible customers failed to receive waivers of front-end sales charges when they bought fund shares after previously selling shares from the same fund family, while others failed to receive rebates of back-end sales fees.
Merrill Lynch did not admit or deny wrongdoing. FINRA said the accord reflected the unit's ""extraordinary"" cooperation, including its hiring an outside consultant to find harmed customers and promptly paying restitution.
In 2014, FINRA ordered Merrill Lynch to pay an $8 million fine and $24.4 million in restitution to settle charges it failed to waive mutual fund sales charges and fees on more than 47,000 accounts for retirement plans and charitable entities.

FINRA is a self-regulatory organization for the financial industry.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets pared losses at the opening Thursday to trade roughly unchanged, as a sharp three-day rally gave way to consolidation in the wake of an uncomfortable reminder of the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street.
Data released earlier showed that continuing jobless claims unexpectedly rose by some 650,000 two weeks ago to 21.49 million, suggesting that the pace of re-hiring after a disastrous April is still not keeping up with new job losses. Initial jobless claims, which cover last week, did however fall below 2 million for the first time since March, totalling only 1.877 million.
By 10:05 AM ET (1405 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7 points, effectively unchanged. The S&P 500 was also flat and the Nasdaq Composite, which has rallied to within sight of a new all-time high in the last month, was up less than 0.1%.
While recent survey data have pointed to a stabilization in May, there was still evidence of how sharply the economy contracted in April, as new figures showing exports falling by nearly one quarter from March's levels, and imports falling by 15%.
The market wasn't noticeably affected by news from Europe, where the European Central Bank nearly doubled the size of its flagship anti-pandemic bond-buying program to 1.35 trillion euros ($1.5 trillion).
Among individual stocks,  Warner Music Group  (NASDAQ:WMG) stock rose another 1.2% after soaring 20% on its market debut on Wednesday, whille airline stocks bucked the downward trend after another upbeat update from American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
American Airlines stock rose 9.4% after the carrier said it will fly 55% of its year-earlier domestic schedule in July. That's up from some 20%-25% in the current month. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock rose 4.1% and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock rose 3.6% in sympathy. 
TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) stock rose 2.5% but Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) stock fell marginally after the two companies said that the Department of Justice had ended its investigation into their proposed merger, which they now expect to close in the second half of the year. 
Another merger, however, appeared to be in trouble after reports that LVMH (OTC:LVMUY) is looking to revise the terms of its proposed deal for Tiffany, owing to the lowered outlook for the U.S. jewelry market. Tiffany (NYSE:TIF) stock fell another 0.5% after sliding nearly 10% on Wednesday on rumors of the French company's change of heart.
Elsewhere, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock rose 0.7% after Reuters reported that the e-commerce giant is looking to buy a $2 billion stake in Indian telecommunications company  Bharti Airtel  Ltd. (NS:BRTI).
U.S. Crude Oil Futures meanwhile fell 1.4% to $36.78 amid doubts that the OPEC+ bloc of crude exporters will extend their agreement to keep 9.7 million barrels of oil a day off world markets. The deal is due to be relaxed at the end of the month as the weakening of the global pandemic allows demand to pick up.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 10:06AM ET</span>",Exclusive: GM plans electric van for business users in bid to pre-empt Tesla,"By Ben Klayman and Paul Lienert
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) is developing an electric van aimed at business users, joining a growing list of carmakers planning EVs for the same segment which includes customers such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS), five people familiar with the plans told Reuters. 
That multibillion-dollar strategy could enable GM, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and at least two EV startups to build and deliver more electric vehicles at a time when consumer demand for battery-powered models is still a small fraction of overall industry sales, while targeting a potentially lucrative market segment that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has yet to address.
GM's plan to develop an electric van has not previously been reported. The No. 1 U.S. automaker did not confirm the van, but has said it plans to introduce at least 20 new all-electric vehicles by 2023, in a variety of body styles including sedans, trucks and crossovers. 
Suppliers familiar with such plans at GM and Ford told Reuters the Detroit automakers, which count trucks and commercial vehicles among their most profitable businesses, ""don't want to leave the door open for Tesla"" as they did in consumer passenger cars.
Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director of fleet maintenance and engineering, said the package delivery firm believes electric vans have the potential to disrupt the commercial market.
""It's going to be similar to what the Model 3 has done for the consumer market,"" Phillippi said, referring to Tesla's small near-luxury electric sedan. ""Now all of a sudden, we're off to the races.""
The GM van – code-named BV1 – is due to start production in late 2021, the sources said. It is believed the BV1 van will share some components with GM's future electric pickups and SUVs, including the automaker's new Ultium advanced battery system. It is expected to be assembled alongside the electric trucks at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant.
GM is considering whether to offer the electric van through its traditional truck brands - Chevrolet and GMC - or market it under a different brand such as Maven, the sources said. GM's first electric pickup truck, due in late 2021, will be sold by GMC dealers under the Hummer brand.
In a statement, GM said it is ""committed to an all-electric future and is implementing a multi-segment, scalable EV strategy to get there. At this time, we do not have any announcements to make regarding electric commercial vehicles.""
The GM electric van project is aimed at an important segment of the emerging EV market – commercial delivery vehicles. For established players, this is a hugely profitable business segment driven by cost of ownership, not fancy tech or star power. It is also a segment in which Tesla and its high-profile CEO, Elon Musk, lack an entry to compete for sales and CO2 credits, which allow automakers to offset the sale of non-electric vehicles including high-margin pickups and SUVs.
""Buyers of commercial vans want reliability and not necessarily a flashy brand name,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. ""The reduced maintenance and fuel use of electric vehicles become very attractive to a business customer, where the current limitations of EVs make the price premium less attractive to individual consumers.""
In February, Ford said it would introduce an electric version of its Transit van for model year 2022. ""The most critical bet we will be making over the next several years will be our commercial vehicles,"" Ford's chief operating officer, Jim Farley, told Reuters at the time.
Ford also is an investor in Michigan-based startup Rivian, which is scheduled to begin building the first of 100,000 mid-size electric vans for Amazon next year.
Amazon rival UPS has commissioned 10,000 mid-size electric vans from British startup Arrival, which is backed by Korea's Hyundai Motor Co and its sister company Kia Motors Corp.
The combined value of the Amazon and UPS contracts with Rivian and Arrival is estimated at $4 billion or more.
And more players in the segments will likely follow, including  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, said Samit Ghosh, chief executive of the Americas for consulting and engineering firm umlaut.

""The delivery vans is a volume not to be underestimated,"" he said. ""I would not just call it a niche segment.""

651,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 09:54AM ET</span>",A Rally Running on Moral Hazard Looks Like the Fed’s Latest Feat,"(Bloomberg) -- “Recovery trade” has become too flaccid a term for what’s going on in the stock market, courtesy of the Federal Reserve.
The S&P 500 has surged almost 40% since March 23, its fastest advance since 1933. The Nasdaq 100 briefly erased all its losses on Wednesday. Corporate borrowers are issuing debt at a record clip as short bets against high-yield bonds evaporate. And with Treasury yields pinned down by interest rates close to zero, valuation models that plot corporate earnings against bond payouts show stocks -- somehow --remain historically cheap.
It’s nothing new -- it’s just lasting longer than anyone expected. With equities powering past millions of lost jobs, images of protesters facing off with police over racism and daily reminders of the coronavirus’s economic toll, some market-watchers are seeing shades of moral hazard. By injecting massive liquidity through Treasury purchases and backstopping corporate bond markets, they say, the central bank is bailing out businesses that may have struggled and fomenting wealth inequality. At the investor level, it’s cover to pile in to riskier assets with little chance of losses.
“The Fed indicating that they’re going to keep interest rates low for a very long period of time, that they’re going to be supportive of the corporate bond market -- in essence what you’re doing is you start to incentivize risk taking,” said Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco (NYSE:IVZ). “There’s a lot of money on the sidelines collecting zero for a long period of time, investors start to think about how to allocate that money.”
In Chairman Jerome Powell’s own words, policy makers acted “forcefully, proactively and aggressively” to combat the effects of the virus on the U.S. economy. The raft of support measures that followed included nine special lending facilities aimed at money markets, municipalities and the credit markets, among others.
The impact was immediate: the S&P 500 bottomed on March 23, the same day that the Fed announced it would take the unprecedented step of buying corporate debt and exchange-traded funds tracking those securities. A record $27 billion flowed into fixed-income ETFs in May after the Fed kick-started its bond-buying program on May 12.
Lifelines are visible in stock market’s most battered corners. Economic reopening optimism has boosted the small-cap Russell 2000 by nearly 16% over the past month, outpacing the broader S&P 500’s 10% gain. Retail brands such as Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS). and L Brands Inc (NYSE:LB). have both surged by nearly 53% over that time, while easing global lockdown measures have buoyed shares of  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd. by 42%.
S&P 500 futures contracts slipped Thursday after the underlying gauge rallied 3.1% in the prior four days.
The Fed’s actions have drawn criticism from high-profile naysayers such as Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at Guggenheim Investments, who said Wednesday that the central bank sent the world a “buy signal” through its programs propping up the corporate bond market. That concern has been echoed by Fed veterans such as William Dudley.
“People who have high-yield debt outstanding, a lot of times that happens by choice,” said Dudley, former New York Fed president, in a Bloomberg Television interview. “For the Federal Reserve to intervene and support those asset prices, is basically creating a little bit of a moral hazard in the sense that you’re encouraging people to take on more debt.”
In addition to the lending facilities, the Fed also slashed rates to near zero and pledged unlimited quantitative easing, ballooning its balance sheet to $7 trillion. That’s confined benchmark 10-year Treasury yields to an 18-basis point range over the past month near historically low levels. By some measures, that makes stocks more attractive: one fashionable indicator, the price-liquidity ratio -- which compares S&P 500 market cap versus total money supply -- suggests that equities actually look cheap, even as earnings collapse.
“The potential is there for another bubble in financial assets. I view the Fed as another data point in the supply demand equation and the old adage of “don’t fight the Fed” comes to mind,” said Dan Russo, chief market strategist at Chaikin Analytics. “Does that have the potential to inflate bubbles? Yes.”
Of course, it’s hard to argue that the Fed had other options when faced with a pandemic of unprecedented proportions and an all-but-guaranteed recession. Even with the raft of emergency measures, the extent of the economic damage has been catastrophic. The U.S. unemployment rate is expected to surge to 19.5% in May, after spiking to 14.7% the prior month. Average hourly earnings are forecast to rise by 8.5% on a yearly basis, suggesting that the hardest hit have been low-income earners.
Powell himself has acknowledged the extreme length the central bank has gone to in order to cushion the economy. He insisted that the Fed’s policies “absolutely” don’t add to inequality and said the central bank’s real aim is to preserve jobs by keeping companies afloat.
“Think about where we were in early April with inflation expectations close to one and falling and 6 million people joining the ranks of the unemployed,” Invesco’s Levitt said. “If the Fed doesn’t respond to that or even tightens in that environment like they did during the Great Depression, you exacerbate the situation and make it far worse.”
Still, the ensuing equity rally born from those policies has bedeviled bears and is even starting to confuse the bulls. For Albert Edwards at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), who is sticking to his bearish call on mega-cap technology stocks, it’s been an exercise in frustration.
“We are now only 10% from February’s all-time high, and with the U.S. unemployment rate heading toward 20%, one might ask: At what point does the stark disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street become a political embarrassment for the Fed?” Edwards wrote in a note last week. “Maybe never.”

Buyer incentives for passenger cars, including a lowering of value added tax (VAT) to 16% from 19% were included as part of a 130 billion euro ($145.74 billion) stimulus but analysts said it would not be enough to significantly boost car demand.
""The lowering of VAT will hardly provide an impetus,"" said Peter Fuss, a partner at EY, adding that electric cars are still too much of a niche product to lift the overall market.
Germany included a 6,000 euro incentive for battery electric cars costing below 40,000 euros, bringing consumer incentives for electric cars to 9,000 euros once a 3,000 euro manufacturer stipend is included. [nL8N2DH2E8]
According to Germany's Federal Office for Economy and Export, BAFA, the cars eligible for the full subsidy include the BMW i3, Hyundai's Ioniq and Kona models, Kia's E-Nero, Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY)'s electric 208,  Renault  (PA:RENA)'s Zoe and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s Model 3.
VW is readying a mass market push for its ID3 model which will cost below 40,000 euros.
Tesla's Model S and the Mercedes EQC are also eligible for subsidies but not for the full amount.
Electric cars made up only 1.8% of new passenger car registrations last year in Germany.
Germany will overhaul its motor vehicle tax. From January 2021, cars with an emission of more than 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre will face higher levies. 
The average vehicle emissions of a new car last year in Germany was around 150.9 grams of CO2 per kilometre. Due to the popularity of SUVs, average emissions of new cars rose to 154.8 grams per kilometre in May.

Germany unveiled the incentives as part of a broader stimulus plan which included staggered taxes to penalise ownership of large polluting combustion-engined sports utility vehicles.
Customers have been concerned about the limited operating range of electric cars, a factor which has hampered demand. Converting Germany's 14,118 petrol stations would provide a significant boost to electric vehicle demand.
In Germany, electric cars made up only 1.8% of new passenger car registrations last year, with diesel and petrol cars accounting for 32% and 59.2% respectively.
Of the 168,148 new registrations in May, only 5,578 or 3.3% were electric cars according to German vehicle agency KBA. A further 51.1% were petrol powered, 31.6% were diesel cars and 17.6% were hybrid or plug-in hybrid cars. 
As of March 2020, Germany had only 27,730 electric car charging stations according to BDEW, Germany's association for the energy and water industry. 
To make electric cars a mass market phenomenon, at least 70,000 charging stations and 7,000 fast charging stations are required, according to the BDEW.

BRUSSELS/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - As bars across Europe gradually reopen, up to a million free or pre-paid beers are waiting to lure back wary consumers.
Beer makers from global giant  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI) to smaller craft brewers have set up schemes for consumers to buy drinks in advance to support shuttered bars with, in some cases, the reward of free beer when the doors reopen.
AB InBev launched its first scheme ""Cafe Courage"" in Belgium and has since sold over 200,000 Stella Artois, Jupiler and other brands. It also started similar schemes in 20 other markets across Europe and from Brazil to Hong Kong, raising over $6 million for pubs, bars and restaurants.
World number two  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) put the number of drinks sold through its various voucher schemes at 270,000.
Now the bars are opening, consumers have had their first chance to redeem coupons or vouchers.
Danish friends Arendse Rohland and Thomas Hoffner Lovgren were among those to profit from free beers after bars re-opened there on May 18.
Danish brewer Carlsberg (CO:CARLb) offered lagers in a bar to consumers who bought bottles or cans from stores in its ""Adopt a Keg"" scheme. The idea was to lure drinkers back with free drinks and hope that they would then buy more. Hoffner Lovgren and Rohland both seemed willing to do so.
""I rarely only drink one beer,"" Roland said after collecting a free drink at Carl's Ol & Spisehus in a Copenhagen suburb.
Drinkers elsewhere are now in line. France became the latest country on Tuesday to allow bars and restaurants to operate after the Netherlands on Monday. Ireland and Belgium are expected to follow later this month, with Britain in July.
Julian Marsili, Carlsberg global brand director, said its campaign would even continue into the summer.
""Travel will not be massive, at least outside Denmark, so we are encouraging people who want to adopt kegs to explore Denmark further in bars in the tourist places,"" he said.
The schemes have helped, but not made up the shortfall. In Britain, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said pubs could have recorded their best April in a decade, selling 745 million pints in unseasonably warm and sunny weather.
The issue is acute for brewers, with about a third of beer typically consumed in pubs, bars or cafes. In value terms, that can rise to 60-65%, according to Pierre-Olivier Bergeron, secretary general of the Brewers of Europe.
Beer sales in stores have risen, but well below the rate of wine and spirits and not enough to make up for the loss of on-premise drinking, according to U.S. data from marketing research firm Nielsen.
WILL THEY COME?
Reopened bars and restaurants will clearly not operate as they did before the coronavirus closures, with limited time at the bar or table service, shorter hours and measures to minimise contact between staff and customers and to keep customers apart.
Emma McClarkin, BBPA chief executive, said the social distancing gap made a big difference. Two metres, currently used in Britain, might only allow only a third of Britain's 47,000 pubs to reopen while a one-metre rule, deemed safe by the World Health Organization, would allow 75% to operate, she said. 
Brewers have also been helping with some of the new hardware involved and learning from China, where restaurants and bars reopened from March.
Jan Craps, chief executive of Budweiser Brewing Co APAC, said the AB InBev Asian subsidiary had sent ""welcome kits"" including hand sanitizer, gloves, masks and advice to 50,000 bars and restaurants across China and 1,000 plastic screens to help smaller venues separate groups of customers.
Craps said the kits were being replicated in many other countries, such as the Americas where the brewer has its largest markets.
A study for the brewer of British pub-goers found 93% were keen to revisit their local and over a third intend to visit within a week of reopening. A majority also wanted to keep 2 metres away from strangers.
Business will not resume as before. Belgian cafe and restaurant owners expect on average 45% fewer customers as a result of social distancing measures and consumer wariness.

""It's not a back to normal situation... establishments now reopening will be reopening under pretty special conditions,"" Bergeron said.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>","HSBC, StanChart criticised for backing Hong Kong security law","By Sumeet Chatterjee, Yanni Chow and Sinead Cruise
HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Senior British politicians criticised HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) on Thursday after the banks backed China's national security law for Hong Kong, in conflict with the British government's opposition to the proposed legislation.
In a break from their usual policy of political neutrality, the British banks on Wednesday expressed support for the law even as it drew global condemnation, including from Britain, and revived anti-government demonstrations in the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong.
Shares in HSBC, which is Britain's biggest bank, fell 1% in London, paring earlier gains in its Hong-Kong listed stocks while Standard Chartered rose slightly in London against a 1.2% drop in the FTSE 350 banks index (FTNMX8350).
""I wonder why HSBC and StanChart are choosing to back an authoritarian state's repression of liberties and undermining of the rule of law,"" Tom Tugendhat, Conservative Party member and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee tweeted.
People who said they are HSBC customers posted on social media that they will close their accounts in response to HSBC's backing of Beijing. 
HSBC and StanChart declined to comment. 
The reaction highlighted the predicament facing the two banks, based in Britain but with deep roots in China where they are trying to expand when the country's ruling party is clashing with Britain and the United States. 
Hong Kong accounted for 90% of HSBC's pre-tax profit and 41% of StanChart's in 2019, showing the importance of the Asian financial hub to the banks' bottom line. 
""The investment case for HSBC is clouded by the outlook for Hong Kong and steps by China to impose greater control over the autonomous region,"" said Will Howlett, equity analyst at HSBC shareholder Quilter Cheviot.
The Global Times, which is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said that HSBC's move should have come earlier.
Some of HSBC's corporate peers including Cathay Pacific Airways (HK:0293) have faced retribution from Beijing for perceived support for the anti-government protesters.
HSBC backing comes after former Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying on Friday criticised the bank for not making its ""stance"" clear on the law and said that its China business could be ""replaced overnight"" by banks from China and other countries.
The United States, Australia and Canada have all criticised China for imposing the law on the former British colony.
Some employees of HSBC and StanChart noted that the business imperative was likely the reason for the support.
""The reason for the statement is white terror, forced action to protect the bank's business,"" Wong, an HSBC staffer in Hong Kong who declined to give his full name, told Reuters. 
""When (these) two banks started to take a stand, it will be no surprise that other banks will start to follow suit.""
A StanChart employee, Tony, who also declined to give his full name, said: ""The commercial sector of Hong Kong is definitely influenced by the Chinese government as we need them for our business.""
But the Hong Kong Finance General Employee Union, formed in September to bring together local financial professionals amid pro-democracy protests, has criticised the move.

""HSBC and Standard Chartered should clarify if they are betraying Hong Kong people while most of the governments from the western world are against this evil law and supporting Hong Kong people,"" union Chairman Ka-Wing Kwok said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge lower Thursday, consolidating after recent gains amid increased Sino-U.S. tensions and ahead of key unemployment data.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 14 points, or 0.5%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 18 points, or 0.2%. The Dow Futures contract fell 105 points, or 0.4%. 
All three cash indices are well over 30% above their first-quarter lows, boosted by hopes of a faster economic recovery amid signs the Covid-19 pandemic's grip on the economy has relaxed. 
ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) on Wednesday said that private payrolls fell by 2.76 million jobs in May, confounding economists' expectations for a drop of 9 million.
Attention will now turn to the weekly initial jobless claims, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). These are expected to come in at 1.8 million, lower than 2.1 million reported last week and a solid sign of continued improvement. 
There are a couple of blots on the horizon. Civil unrest throughout America is showing few signs of stopping, while tensions between China and the U.S. rose overnight after the U.S. suspended flights into the country by Chinese airlines effective from June 16 in response to an earlier Chinese move to bar American carriers.
This is the latest conflict between the two sides after China approved the enactment of national security laws in Hong Kong and Macau last month.
In corporate news, General Motors (NYSE:GM) will be in the spotlight after CEO Mary Barra expected confidence Wednesday that North American vehicle production will return close to pre-pandemic levels by end-June. 
Costco (NASDAQ:COST) will also be in focus after the retailer returned to growth last month, saying late Wednesday that its May net sales rose 7.5% to $12.6 billion. Online sales helped, more than doubling in the month.
Oil prices headed lower Thursday, amid uncertainty over when the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will next meet and what that means for production cuts going ahead.
This overshadowed Wednesday’s surprise fall in stockpiles of U.S. crude of 2.1 million barrels for the week ended May 29.
U.S. crude prices fell 1.6% to $36.69 a barrel, while Brent Futures dropped 0.8% to $39.48.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,716.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1201, down 0.3%.

As the coronavirus pandemic grounded planes around the world, airlines routinely offered vouchers for cancelled flights without informing customers of their right to a full cash refund, in contravention of EU rules, Garzon said on state broadcaster TVE.
Under EU rules, airlines must offer to reimburse customers whose trips were cancelled within seven days of the cancellation.
""We found out that this was not happening,"" Garzon told TVE. ""The majority of airlines, though not all, have been engaging in bad practice.""
The ministry said 17 airlines continued to offer vouchers without informing customers of the right to a refund, even after they received a written warning.
A judge will now investigate the situation and decide whether to take further action against the companies, Garzon said. 
He did not specify which airlines were included in the investigation though he acknowledged the fallout from the coronavirus had put the sector under financial strain. 
""Airlines of course have problems from the health crisis but that's why the government has set up credit lines and other forms of support,"" he said.

Last month, the Spanish government granted 1 billion euros ($1.12 billion) of government-backed loans to cope with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic to International Consolidated Airlines Group's (L:ICAG) Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling.

(Reuters) - German agrochemicals group  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGn) has been blocked from selling its dicamba-based weed killer in the United States after an appeals court rejected a federal regulator's permit for the product.
A three-judge panel ruled that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) substantially understated the risks related to the use of dicamba which is found in herbicides made by Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and its rivals.
Environmental groups, which filed a lawsuit in 2018, wanted the court to force the EPA to cancel its approval of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON)'s dicamba-based XtendiMax product, arguing it not only harms nearby crops and plants but wildlife as well.
Bayer inherited this and other lawsuits two years ago as a result of its $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto.
The ruling also blocks the selling of other dicamba-based herbicides such as BASF's Engenia and  Corteva  Agriscience's (N:CTVA) FeXapan. 
Both Bayer and BASF said they did not agree with the judgment issued on Wednesday. Shares in Bayer traded 3.3% lower by 0930 GMT on Thursday, while BASF slipped 0.7%. 
Bayer said the ruling relates to the EPA's 2018 registration decision, which expires in December and it was working to obtain a new EPA registration for the weed killer for 2021 and beyond.
""Depending upon actions by the EPA and whether the ruling is successfully challenged, we will work quickly to minimize any impact on our customers this season,"" Bayer said.
The EPA had imposed restrictions on the use of dicamba in November 2018 due to concerns about the potential damage to crops surrounding those it was being applied to.
In February, Bayer had said it would appeal a U.S. jury's $265 million damages award against it and BASF in favor of a Missouri farmer who said the company's dicamba herbicide had destroyed his peach orchards.
The latest ruling comes days after, a California appeals court heard arguments in the first case that went to trial over allegations that Bayer's glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup causes cancer, resulting in an initial $289 million judgment against the company, later reduced to $78 million.
Monsanto had dominated soybean sales since the 1990s with Roundup Ready, modified to withstand the weed-killer glyphosate.

Some weeds have since developed resistance to glyphosate due to overuse, however, raising the need for soy that can resist alternative herbicides.

British Airways came under heavy attack from lawmakers in parliament on Wednesday, who accused it of taking advantage of a government scheme to protect jobs while at the same time announcing plans to cut its workforce by 28%.
Planes were grounded in March due to coronavirus restrictions, forcing many airlines to cut thousands of staff as they struggle without revenues. Airlines serving Britain now face an additional threat from a 14-day quarantine rule. 
In an internal letter to staff seen by Reuters, Alex Cruz, the chief executive of British Airways said the job losses were necessary as IAG's cash reserves would not last forever and the future was one of more competition for fewer customers. 
BA also wants to change terms and conditions for its remaining workers to give it more flexibility by, for example, making all crew fly both short and long-haul.
Cruz said IAG, which also owns Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, was getting through 178 million pounds a week, meaning that it could not just sit out the crisis. The group had 10 billion euros of liquidity at the end of April.
""BA does not have an absolute right to exist. There are major competitors poised and ready to take our business,"" Cruz said in the letter. 
He urged two unions which represent cabin crew and other staff, GMB and Unite, to join in discussions to mitigate proposed redundancies. Pilots union BALPA is ""working constructively"" with the airline, he added. 
Cruz also joined other airline bosses in criticising Britain's quarantine rule, due to come into effect on June 8, calling it ""another blow to our industry"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fifteen U.S. airlines were granted final government approval on Wednesday to temporarily halt service to 75 domestic airports as travel demand has been crushed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. Transportation Department said all airports would continue to be served by at least one air carrier. Despite some objections to a tentative list made public on May 22, the government did not make any changes.
The U.S. airline industry has been awarded $25 billion in government payroll assistance grants to help weather the pandemic. While carriers must maintain minimum service levels to receive the assistance, many petitioned to stop service to airports with low passenger demand.
The department has previously allowed some airlines to halt service to some airports and rejected other requests. 
Both United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) won approval to halt flights to 11 airports. Allegiant Air was allowed to halt service to six airports, while JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp, Alaska Airlines,  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) and Frontier Airlines gained approval to stop flights to five airports each.
U.S. air carriers have said they are collectively burning through more than $10 billion in cash a month as travel demand remains a fraction of prior levels. They have parked more than half of their planes and cut thousands of flights. 
Cities that Delta can halt service to include Aspen, Colorado; Bangor, Maine; Santa Barbara, California and Flint, Michigan.
United can halt service to airports including Chattanooga, Tennessee; Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina as well as Key West, Florida.
Other airlines winning approval to halt some flights include American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Sun Country Airlines and Silver Airlines.

LONDON (Reuters) - Cheap renewable energy, climate policies and the coronavirus are pushing fossil fuel companies towards a process of ""terminal decline"" that could trigger a new financial crisis unless regulators act, according to a study (https://carbontracker.org/reports/decline-and-fall) published on Thursday.
Carbon Tracker, a think-tank that assesses the risks to investments in oil, natural gas and coal posed by a transition to cleaner energy, said demand for these commodities might never fully recover from a collapse triggered by the pandemic.
""We are witnessing the decline and fall of the fossil fuel system,"" said Kingsmill Bond, a co-author.
Technological innovation and policy support was leading to peak fossil fuel demand in ""sector after sector and country after country, and the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this,"" Bond said. ""We may now have seen peak fossil fuel demand as a whole.""
Whether and how fossil fuel demand may rebound after the pandemic is hotly contested, with many projections assuming that demand for oil, in particular, could steadily return as lockdowns lift.
Nevertheless, Carbon Tracker's work is widely-watched because of its role in informing international regulatory initiatives on climate change spearheaded by U.N. envoy Mark Carney, a former governor of the Bank of England.
The report said that companies across the fossil fuels system are worth $18 trillion in listed equity, a quarter of the value of global equity markets. They also account for trillions of dollars of corporate bonds and bank debt.

With this chunk of the world economy increasingly vulnerable to disruption, regulators must ensure that companies properly account for the likely impact of the 2015 Paris climate accord on their future profitability, the report said.

663,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Germany Supports Consumers, Not the Auto Sector","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Germany’s stock market is selling the fact of the country’s second big stimulus package, having bought the rumor aggressively earlier.
By 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the DAX was down 0.7%, but still well above the 12,000 mark that it reclaimed for the first time since March earlier in the week. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.6%, consolidating ahead of the European Central Bank’s meeting.
The package - worth 130 billion euros over the next two years - was as noteworthy for what was missing as for what was actually included: in contrast to the big fiscal packages of 2009, there was almost no direct aid to the auto sector, while the overwhelming bulk of the package went to support lower earners and families, as well as the municipalities whose public services they depend on. 
There was no wholesale scrappage scheme to incentivize purchases of new cars. Such support for the makers of mainly luxury cars at a time of unparalleled economic collapse was too politically toxic. But Berlin did increase the amount of federal subsidies for buying pure electric vehicles, and provided another 2.5 billion to expand the country’s charging network.
This is the legacy specifically of the diesel emissions scandal, where Volkswagen and, to a lesser extent,  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF) and BMW for years sold cars whose actual emissions of harmful exhaust fumes far exceeded the makers’ claims, contributing to pollution crisis that had already shortened over half a million European lives by 2016, when the scale of the cheating became clear.
Daimler (DE:DAIGn) stock was down 2.8% by mid-morning in Frankfurt, while BMW (DE:BMWG) stock was down 1.7% and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock was down 0.9%. VW outperformed because it is arguably in the best position to profit from the new subsidies for electric cars, which will apply only to models with prices up to 40,000 euros ($45,000). One point of note is that the local price of Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 is also currently above that ceiling, which will help ensure that the big three’s most potent competitor doesn’t get the lion’s share of the goodies – unless Tesla cuts its prices.
The industry should profit a little from the temporary cut in Value Added Tax to 16% from 19% for the rest of the year, but that, too, is a measure that will serve more to relieve the stress on smaller businesses, allowing them to pad their margins a bit and to work with less working capital.
In all, though, it’s a package for consumers rather than producers, which is why the DAX seems so underwhelmed – there are, after all, precious few stocks in the DAX that depend on the German consumer. Nivea-maker  Beiersdorf  's (DE:BEIG) stock was a notable outperformer, rising 1.1%, while consumer goods group Henkel (DE:HNKG_p) and fashion retailer Zalando (DE:ZALG) also kept their losses to a modest 0.1%."

LVMH, run by France's richest man, Bernard Arnault, agreed to buy Tiffany in November, before the retail business was hammered by the pandemic.
Arnault is now exploring ways to reopen negotiations and potentially pressure Tiffany to lower the agreed deal price of $135 per share, people familiar with the matter told Reuters, including by examining its compliance with financial covenants.
The French conglomerate, behind brands such as Louis Vuitton, said that its board had this week discussed the potential impact of the pandemic ""on the results and perspectives of  Tiffany & Co  with respect to the agreement that links the two groups.""
LVMH gave no further details, beyond specifying that it would not seek to buy shares in the U.S. jeweller on the open market, which could have been one way to buy Tiffany at a lower price. 
Tiffany will release quarterly earnings on June 9, which had originally been scheduled for this Friday. Tiffany shares closed at $114 on Wednesday. 
It was not clear what strategy LVMH might pursue to secure a price cut and whether it would see it through, sources have said, but one way into a renegotiation would be if Tiffany breached its financial covenants under the deal. 
LVMH has not asked Tiffany to reopen talks.
Tiffany does not believe there is a legal basis to renegotiate the deal, the sources also said. 

The company is in compliance with financial covenants under the merger agreement with LVMH, and expects to remain so after declaring a quarterly dividend two weeks ago, the sources said.

The Detroit automaker said in March it would invest $20 billion by 2025 in electric and automated vehicles as it races to catch up with Elon Musk's Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) in the sector.
""We have already established a good working relationship and supply agreement with CATL,"" said Julian Blissett, GM's China president. ""We will work very closely with CATL in the future.""
""We are not planning on importing any major components for new energy vehicles. The drive units, batteries, motors, etc, will be made locally in China,"" Blissett told local media on Wednesday, according to the transcript provided by GM.
Co-operation with GM would help cement Ningde-based CATL's dominant position in the Chinese EV battery market, where it competes with smaller players like BYD (SZ:002594) and Guoxuan High-tech (SZ:002074).
The group, which already has supply deals with Tesla and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China is the world's biggest market for new energy vehicles, which include battery electric cars as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles.

Through another venture, SGMW, GM sells electric Wuling minivans and Baojun E-Series mini cars with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators will announce a bill this week expanding sanctions on Russia's Gazprom-led Nord Stream 2 project, Senate aides said, targeting a pipeline Washington says will make Europe too reliant on Russian gas.
The Protecting Europe's Energy Security Clarification Act follows legislation signed by President Donald Trump last year, which prompted Swiss-Dutch company Allseas to halt undersea work.
Two Russian-owned pipe-laying vessels may now be used to finish the remaining 100 miles (160 km) of the project, led by state-run Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
The new legislation, spearheaded by Senators Ted Cruz, a Republican, and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, would expand sanctions to include penalties on parties involved in pipe-laying activities, not just laying pipes, and parties providing underwriting services, insurance or reinsurance for vessels.
A copy of a draft bill was seen by Reuters.
Cruz said it ""makes clear those involved with vessels installing the pipeline will face crippling and immediate sanctions."" 
The bill must be passed by both chambers of Congress and signed by Trump. It adds sanctions on companies providing services or facilities for the vessels, including welding equipment, retrofitting or tethering of the ships. 
Many politicians and energy companies in Germany support Nord Stream 2 as Europe's biggest economy seeks to end the use of coal and nuclear power. 
The Trump administration has said U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) would give Europe an alternative to Russian supplies. Gas flows to U.S. LNG export plants have fallen to a 13-month low due to weak global demand. 
German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier criticised Washington last week for ""escalating this sanctions threat, which is extraterritorial and thus in conflict with international law."" 
A pipe-laying ship Academic Cherskiy which Moscow could use changed ownership from Gazprom Fleet to regional firm STIF, Russia's international vessel registry showed this week. 
STIF was linked to a group of Gazprom companies as of April 1 but there was no data on STIF's ownership since then, Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov told Reuters.
Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking data showed Academic Cherskiy has been moored near Germany's Mukran port in the Baltic Sea. 
Nord Stream 2 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Citigroup  (N:C) is looking to ramp up its commercial banking operations across Europe, Middle East and Africa, plugging gaps left by rivals facing fallout from a coronavirus-induced recession.
The U.S. bank plans to expand its business lending division catering to companies with annual turnover between $25 million and $2.5 billion with a slew of new hires and office launches in several Western European countries by the end of 2020.
Competitors, including HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN), have made similar bids to win business from small and mid-sized European companies in the past few years, hoping to increase revenues in a market traditionally dominated by local banks.
""If you look at European banks right now, many are refocusing as national champions, selling off or reducing marginal overseas businesses where they didn't have scale,"" said Ray Gatcliffe, Head of Citi Commercial Bank for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).
The time is right to expand despite fears of credit losses caused by the pandemic, Gatcliffe said, as rivals pare lending to smaller, fast-growing companies which find they need a global bank when liquidity is being used up by domestic or blue chip clients.
While Citi as a whole operates in 55 countries in EMEA, its commercial banking unit - which has around 5,000 clients in the region - only has offices in 15 with another 21 countries served from hubs such as Dublin, Dubai and London.
The 15 offices are predominantly in central and eastern Europe including Poland, Turkey and Russia. 
Gatcliffe declined to specify where Citi will expand first but said he wanted to add to the unit's 500-strong EMEA team with a minimum of 10-20 hires for each new office.
""A lot of companies in EMEA have been impacted by their banks reducing global and even regional footprints. We've kept our global network and think that will resonate with clients seeking to expand internationally,"" Gatcliffe said.
""It's not an inexpensive proposition to have local banking licences across the globe as we do. There are important opportunities and obligations attached to having such a broad geographical footprint."" 
The launch of Citi's UK commercial banking business in 2017 has also provided a blueprint for expansion elsewhere, he added. Last year, that business contributed 21% of EMEA revenues.
Citi is particularly targeting fintech companies which often require cross-border services. 
In 2019, the bank expanded its Digital Client business to 16 Western European markets including Germany, Spain and the Nordics.  

These markets are currently served by digital hubs in London, Dublin and Tel Aviv.

669,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>","Rolls-Royce Plans 3,000 U.K. Job Cuts as Aviation Contracts","(Bloomberg) -- Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (LON:RR) plans to eliminate 3,000 jobs in the U.K. this year, the first wave of cuts that could ultimately see the jet-engine maker emerge from the downturn a much smaller business.
The London-based manufacturer said it expects to trim a total of 8,000 positions from the aviation division. This would make up the bulk of the 9,000 global reductions it announced in May, when it became clear how the Covid-19 crisis is undermining demand for new aircraft.
Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) is offering voluntary redundancy packages to all of its aviation workforce and part of its back-office staff, according to an email on Wednesday. The company expects 1,500 jobs to go in Derby and the East Midlands, its main manufacturing base, 200 in nearby Barnoldswick, and an additional 700 in Inchinnan, Scotland.
Sites across the rest of the U.K., including Bristol and Solihull, will also see losses ranging from 50 to 200 jobs per location. The company had initially planned to open up voluntary redundancy on May 28 but had to hold off following disagreement with unions over the terms of the package, based on an earlier statement on the GMB union’s website.
‘Very Tough’
“We are facing changes to the business on a scale we have not seen for 50 years,” Chris Cholerton, president of civil aerospace at the company, said in the emailed statement. “This is going to be very tough for everyone, but we have to ensure Rolls-Royce can thrive for future generations.”
The British industrial giant, which also has operations in the defense and energy sectors, has been through several contractions in its aerospace business, and Chief Executive Officer Warren East was just turning a corner on persistent engine-quality problems before the pandemic struck. It’s now left facing the loss of a huge chunk of revenue as airlines ground planes and airframers cut production to get through the crisis.
Layoffs are being announced across the aviation and aerospace industries. U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. has embarked on thousands of job cuts, and rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) has also signaled a need to reduce headcount. French jet engine and parts maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA has said 5,000 positions outside France will go -- including 3,000 in Mexico and the rest in countries like the U.S. and U.K.
Read more: Jet Engine Maker Safran to Cut 5,000 Jobs Outside France
U.K. unions were caught off-guard by Rolls-Royce’s initial announcement in May that it planned to cut jobs. GMB and Unite unions resisted the original plan, requesting more roles be trimmed voluntarily and better terms for redundancy packages.
While that obstacle’s been cleared, more friction is possible if not enough employees accept terms of the buyout offers. The next meeting with the union will take place on June 19, Rolls-Royce said. If no agreement can be reached, a ballot on strike action could follow, according to a labor representative.
“The job losses have to happen because there is simply that much less manufacturing activity,” said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Sandy Morris. “If you carry 700 million pounds too much in cost, your cash generation remains weak for years.”
Close Sites
Rolls-Royce could also close sites in its bid to slash costs. A company official said Wednesday that it’s considering closing the services business at its Inchinnan, which makes a range of gas-turbine products including compressor blades and aircraft seals. Other sites which have seen their aerospace work dry up could also be at risk of closure, said the union representative. One such site is Hucknall, which manufactures components for gas turbines and employs 800 people.
East has told investors that Rolls-Royce aims to save 1.3 billion pounds this year and expects 700 million pounds ($881 million) of savings to come from job cuts. He said last month that Rolls-Royce aims to make more than half of the job cuts this year, while acknowledging that union consultations could take months.
The company chief has also said the company would consider taking advantage of the U.K. government’s Covid Corporate Financing Facility to ensure extra liquidity but it would “be a relatively small amount of funding.” Unions want the company to take additional government funding in order to reduce the need for job losses.
Trade union representatives are also seeking to expand voluntary redundancies into nuclear and submarine operations, to retain more of the skilled aerospace workforce for an eventual recovery.

World consumption of the personal protective equipment is estimated to jump more than 11% to 330 billion pieces this year, two thirds of which are likely to be supplied by Malaysia, its rubber glove manufacturers association (MARGMA) said.
It recently received more than a dozen reports of frauds and fake agents claiming to represent member companies for glove supplies. Counterfeit company letters were produced to appoint bogus agents or potential customers were quoted ""ridiculous"" prices with a promise to cut short delivery time.
""Buyers are reminded that while glove prices have soared and demand is overwhelming, the industry’s supply is being fully booked until early next year,"" MARGMA President Denis Low said in a statement.
""MARGMA foresees the shortage of gloves due to overwhelming demand this year to spill into 2021.""
The global disposable gloves market was valued at $7.6 billion last year and is expected to reach $11.8 billion by 2025, according to VynZ Research. 
MARGMA, whose members include top-two players Top Glove Corp and Supermax Corp, also said worker safety and welfare were being monitored ""critically"" as pressure increases to step up production.
Last week, a group of European politicians urged (https://heidihautala.fi/en/letter-to-commissioner-for-trade-mr-hogan-on-malpractices-in-ppe-supply-chain-in-malaysia-during-covid-19-crisis) the European Union trade commissioner to make sure higher demand does not become an excuse for exploiting workers, who come mainly from Bangladesh, Myanmar and Nepal.
The United States in March lifted a ban on imports from Malaysian glove maker WRP Asia Pacific it had accused of using forced labour.

Developed economies, home to only a fifth of the world's population, account for nearly 70% glove demand due to their stringent medical standards.

Investing.com - European stock markets sold off Thursday, consolidating after recent strong gains ahead of the latest meeting of the European Central Bank.
At 3:55 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 0.2%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.2%. 
Stock markets have been on a roll of late, fueled by investor optimism over the global economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak amid record stimulus measures from governments and central banks. 
Late Wednesday the German government announced its second stimulus package since the start of the pandemic. The new package includes a temporary cut in VAT and one-off handouts for parents of children but does not include direct aid for the car industry, except in the form of grants for smaller electric vehicles and charging stations.
This has prompted some selling in the German autos sector Thursday, with  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) down almost 4%, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW (DE:BMWG) dropped over 2%.
Attention will turn to the European Central Bank meeting later Thursday, with the central bank widely expected to ramp up its stimulative bond purchases to support the region’s battered economies.
The ECB will also publish its new economic forecasts. Data this week suggest the economy may already have bottomed but risks to the recovery remain in the form of a second wave of Covid-19 infections and Sino-U.S. tension that may lead to another damaging trade war.
The ECB delivers its policy decision at 1145 GMT and ECB President Christine Lagarde holds a news conference at 1230 GMT.
In corporate news, French spirits company  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) gained over 6% after saying it expected a strong recovery in the second half of the year, despite seeing operating profit falling by 45-50% in the first half of its 2020/21 fiscal year.
HSBC (LON:HSBA) dropped 0.9% and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) fell 0.4% after the two Asia-focused U.K. banks backed China's imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong, placing them on collision course with the U.K. government.
Oil prices slipped lower Thursday on concerns that major producers will be unable to agree to extend the record level of output cuts that have supported the recent gains.
Also weighing on prices was the release of the Energy Information Administration data late Wednesday, which showed gasoline and distillate stocks rising by much more than expected.
At 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $36.64 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.4% to $39.24.
Elsewhere, gold futures were flat at $1,705.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1201, down 0.3%.

673,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Pandemic exposes cracks in oil majors' bet on plastic,"By Joe Brock
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The energy industry's bet that a petrochemicals boom would support decades of oil and gas sales growth is on shaky ground as an already saturated plastic market is hit by a coronavirus demand shock.
While soaring demand for personal protective equipment and takeaway food containers has boosted sales of some plastics, it is likely to be only a temporary spike, say analysts.
In the longer term, a virus-led hit to economic growth in Asian, African and Latin American markets threatens demand at a time when the industry is already facing bans on single-use plastic that are spreading across the world.
Plastic resin prices, which have been declining over the past two years, have plunged further since the coronavirus hit, an added challenge for investments of hundreds of billions of dollars in petrochemical capacity over the past decade.
""The petrochemicals world has been hit by a double whammy,"" said Utpal Sheth, Executive Director, Chemical and Plastics Insights at data firm IHS Markit.
""Capital investment has been slashed by all companies. This will delay the projects under construction and new projects."" 
(Graphic: Key plastic-making ingredient prices fall to historic lows in China as Covid-19 spread - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/jbyprlxdmpe/LDPEPrices.png)
Dow Inc said in April it would idle three U.S. plants producing polyethylene, the base for plastic bags and bottles.
Thailand's PTT and South Korean partner Daelim have indefinitely delayed an investment decision on a $5.7 billion project in Ohio, three industry sources said. The companies did not respond to request for comment. 
A massive Pennsylvania plastics project, owned by Shell (LON:RDSa), that President Donald Trump touted during a visit last year faces risks of oversupply and a low price outlook, an energy industry report said on Thursday.
Dow and oil majors  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) and BP (NYSE:BP) declined to comment on demand forecasts for this story.
MARKET TROUGH
Still, there are 176 new petrochemical plants planned for the next five years, with nearly 80% of those in Asia, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.
Many plants under construction or late in the planning stages can't be rolled back without incurring massive losses.
Exxon in April kicked off construction on a $10 billion project in China, while Shell and state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp last month approved the expansion of one of the country's biggest ever petrochemical complexes. 
Chinese firms are reviving a $20 billion project in eastern Shandong province to help support a flagging economy, Reuters exclusively reported this week.
""Even before the coronavirus outbreak, we were already expecting to see various petrochemical value chains ... heading into an oversupply situation,"" said Catherine Tan, principle analyst at Wood Mackenzie.
Significantly reducing the wave of new capacity would take years, raising the chances of a prolonged plastic price slump, industry sources said.

ENVIRONMENT FEARS
As they come under financial strain, some plastic producers have requested rescue funds from governments, while industry groups have lobbied lawmakers to roll back bans on single-use plastic, arguing it protects people from disease and germs. 
The U.S. Plastic Industry Association wrote a letter in March to the U.S. Department of Health calling for a reversal of plastic bag bans, arguing that single-use plastic was the safest way to transport and package food. 
However, a New England Medical Journal study in March found the coronavirus was still detected on plastic after 72 hours, compared with up to 24 hours on cardboard and copper.
With the price for virgin, or non-recycled, plastic now at historic lows and oil demand withered, environmentalists fear that producers will pump out cheap plastic to stoke demand and soak up some of the global glut of cheap oil and gas. 
Plastic waste is already piling up in parts of Asia as people use more disposable packaging under coronavirus lockdowns, and recyclers struggle to operate.

""We will see a flood of plastic waste. Even if that wave isn't sustained, the plastic that gets pushed out now will pollute the planet for decades,"" said Carroll Muffett, head of the Center for International Environmental Law, an NGO.

Passengers from 20 cities in Europe, Asia and Australia will be allowed to board flights and transit through Abu Dhabi, the state-owned carrier said on Thursday. 
The UAE government suspended all passenger flights in late March but airlines were later allowed to operate services for foreign citizens leaving the Gulf Arab state. 
It said late on Wednesday that UAE carriers, which include Emirates, flydubai and Air Arabia (DU:AIRA), could resume transit flights.
It was not immediately clear when those airlines would resume transit services.

Cruise lines, hammered by a crisis which has seen some ships develop into high-profile infection hotspots, in recent days have been steadily pushing back cancellations well into the second half of 2020.
Princess Cruises, long a favourite of older travellers, said it has extended the delay of operations on all cruises sailing in and out of Australia through mid-September on the Sea Princess, Majestic Princess, Sun Princess and Sapphire Princess.
At least three of Princess Cruises liners became hotbeds for coronavirus infections. One of them, the Ruby Princess, became part of a homicide investigation in Australia as the country's deadliest virus infection source.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said it will be challenging for cruise ships to structure social distancing in a way that does not put off passengers or make the business model unviable. They expect sailings to resume in 2021.

Carnival, which is also listed on the London Stock Exchange, is set to lose its seat at the top table of British blue chips after the COVID-19 crisis knocked the value of their shares to below the threshold of London's prestigious FTSE 100 index.

""The final investment decision of the Rovuma LNG project has been postponed to, in principle, next year,"" the institute's Chairman Carlos Zacarias told journalists, referring to the Exxon-led project in the gas-rich province of Cabo Delgado. 
However, an Exxon spokesman referred to the comments as ""third-party speculation"", adding that ""Rovuma LNG is a complex project that will take several years to develop"".
He said the decision would not be made this year but declined to comment on when it would. 
The oil giant's decision on the project, which had been expected this year, was postponed in March as the coronavirus outbreak and an oil price slump forced companies to delay projects and cut spending.
Exxon did not say when it planned to make a call on the project. 
Other big oil companies, including France's  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Italy's Eni (MI:ENI), are also involved in projects in the region, home to one of the biggest gas finds in a decade. 

The projects have the potential to transform the economy of Mozambique, one of the world's least developed nations. But apart from the coronavirus, the projects are complicated by militant Islamists in the province with links to Islamic State.

Software maker Avast Plc expects long-lasting benefits from people around the world switching to home office as online workspace faces growing security threats, Chief Executive Officer Ondrej Vlcek said in an interview.
Avast shares have rallied since mid-March, almost doubling its market value as a surge in remote working boosts sales and helps the Prague-based company recover from an earlier privacy scandal. It’s now joining the FTSE 100 Index, the first from the European Union’s eastern flank to win the blue-chip accolade in London just two years after selling shares.
“There are surprisingly few technology companies in FTSE 100,” Vlcek said before the index changes were announced on Wednesday. “Not only are the tech stocks now more resilient than most other industries, but Covid-19 has also been associated with a significant increase in cyber attacks. So I don’t see it as a coincidence that we’re being added now.”

Technology companies like Avast are on the rise as traditional businesses from manufacturers to energy utilities and airlines suffer from slumping demand. Carrier EasyJet Plc, airplane parts-maker  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) Plc and cruise ship operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Plc are among four stocks exiting the index.
Cyber criminals are increasingly trying to exploit weaknesses of the new digital universe where millions of people log on to work from home computers. That’s boosting demand for defense against all types of attacks like ransomware or data theft. Avast, which provides protection for individuals and small enterprises, sees such business boost lasting after the health crisis abates.
“People will still be trying to avoid packed trains and other crowds,” Vlcek said. “The global pandemic will be an impulse for employers who previously didn’t encourage work from home to rethink their approach.”
While some other companies are delivering even bigger returns, among them  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM), Avast has outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 benchmark and some of its behemoths like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Avast shares have now almost fully recovered from the impact of reports that its marketing subsidiary Jumpshot was selling sensitive customer data. After the scandal early this year prompted some users to uninstall the company’s software, Avast decided to wind down the unit at a cost of about $25 million and stay away from the data-analytics business.
While monetizing user data is helping profits of Internet giants such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the practice is raising concerns about potential abuses and attracting more scrutiny from regulators.
The Avast CEO said using Jumpshot to test the viability of such business was “a mistake and gross misjudgment,” but it has helped the company realize it should focus more on services for those willing to pay for better control of their privacy.
“Not only do we find that much more compatible with our core mission and our values, but we also see the data-privacy segment as having a bigger potential from the business-strategy point of view,” Vlcek said. “I see a huge opportunity for companies like Avast in that our business model no longer depends on data mining and this could help us stand out.”
Floppy Disks
Avast founders Eduard Kucera and Pavel Baudis created their first anti-virus program in 1980s communist Czechoslovakia, when malware was mostly spread by floppy disks. Now, the company says it has more than 400 million users worldwide, prevents about 1.5 billion attacks per month, and its market capitalization is 5.1 billion pounds ($6.4 billion).
That makes Avast the second-biggest publicly traded Czech company, even as its home country is far from being a hotbed for startups. Ex-communist central and eastern Europe still relies overwhelmingly on traditional manufacturing with lower-paid jobs and has been struggling to push up the role of more advanced services and technologies to levels common in the West.
Most of Avast’s more than 1,700 employees, including the CEO, are based in the Czech Republic, but its smaller offices in California and London tend to host a majority of the product managers. They create the most value by coming up with new ideas and making them commercially viable.
Still, the company expects a long-term shift toward remote working, which will transform white-collar jobs around the world as more people will look for careers outside their home countries or even continents.
“The increased role of remote work is an equalizer of sorts in that it makes it less relevant where you live,” said Vlcek. “It’s good for workers, who won’t need to commute, it’s good for the environment, and it could be extremely good for diversity and inclusion of, for example, women with small children.”

Lauda had said on Friday it was shutting down its Vienna base after failing to reach an agreement with the union on pay. The move would have involved the loss of around 370 jobs in Lauda.
""After long and difficult negotiations and repeated attempts by the WKO to bring about a compromise, a solution for a collective wage agreement was achieved on Wednesday night,"" the Chamber of Commerce (WKO), which represents businesses in negotiations with unions, said in a statement. 
Austria's Vida union said the deal lasting until 2023 involved a gross monthly wage of 1,440 euros for flight attendants and 2,000 euros for co-pilots, but Lauda management and Ryanair have yet to give their approval.
""It is now up to Laudamotion and Ryanair to accept the Austrian social partners' collective wage agreement and thereby save its employees' jobs and its base at Vienna airport,"" Vida said in a statement, using Lauda's legal name, Laudamotion GmbH. The WKO and unions are referred to as social partners.
Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary had previously said that the group would close Lauda's main hub in the Austrian capital and bring in Ryanair jets instead unless the staff agreed to a pay cut and a new labour agreement.

Vida had long refused to agree to Lauda's proposals as it said they would hit some employees unacceptably hard, provoking criticism from some staff who said they wanted their jobs saved. Pilots in particular had opposed the union.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to edge lower at the open Thursday, consolidating after recent strong gains ahead of the latest meeting of the European Central Bank.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower. France's CAC 40 futures were down 0.2%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.2%.
Stock markets have been on a roll of late, fueled by investor optimism over the global economic recovery from the coronavirus outbreak amid record stimulus measures from governments and central banks. 
In Europe, the DAX index closed at a new three-month high in Frankfurt on Wednesday, and the CAC 40 at a one month peak in Paris.
Late Wednesday the German government announced its second stimulus package since the start of the pandemic. The new package includes a temporary cut in VAT and one-off handouts for parents of children but does not include direct aid for the car industry, except in the form of grants for smaller electric vehicles and charging stations.
With this in mind, attention will turn to the European Central Bank meeting later Thursday, with the central bank widely expected to ramp up its stimulative bond purchases to support the region’s battered economies.
“We believe the ECB is ready to ease monetary policy again,” said analysts at Nordea, in a research note to clients, “this time by raising the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme by 500 bn [euros] to 1250 bn [euros] and possibly even signalling that the purchases will not end by December 2020.”
The ECB will also publish its new economic forecasts. Data this week suggest the economy may already have bottomed but risks to the recovery remain in the form of a second wave of Covid-19 infections and Sino-U.S. tension that may lead to another damaging trade war.

French spirits company  Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) predicted its current operating profit would fall by 45-50% in the first half of its 2020/21 fiscal year due to the coronavirus crisis, although it expected a strong recovery in the second half.
HSBC (LON:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) could also be in focus Thursday, as the two Asia-focused U.K. banks backed China's imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong, placing them on collision course with the U.K. government.
Oil prices slipped lower Thursday on concerns that major producers will be unable to agree to extend the record level of output cuts that have supported the recent gains.
Also weighing on prices was the release of the Energy Information Administration data late Wednesday, which showed gasoline and distillate stocks rising by much more than expected.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.8% lower at $36.63 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.2% to $39.31.

690,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 12:06AM ET</span>","Amid pandemic, investors bet on India's Jio and its giant-killer playbook","By Alexandra Ulmer and Promit Mukherjee
MUMBAI (Reuters) - From its Silicon Valley-like campus near Mumbai, Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio telecom carrier is emerging as a winner from changes in the way Indian consumers plug into a digital economy made more urgent by the coronavirus pandemic.
For Indian shoppers who prefer to order online, it is launching a grocery ordering service with  Facebook Inc 's (O:FB) popular WhatsApp messaging. For Bollywood fans who would prefer to avoid a crowded theater, it is readying same-day-release on the Jio platform.
Those plans had been in the making for months, but the pandemic has given them a shot in the arm. India's 10-week lockdown has also led to a surge in demand for data, boosting Jio's phone and broadband offerings.
And, over the past six weeks, the digital business of Ambani's  Reliance Industries  Ltd (NS:RELI), known as Jio Platforms, raised a striking $10 billion from global investors.
The investments, including $5.7 billion from Facebook and money from private equity firms Silver Lake, Vista Equity Partners, General Atlantic and KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR), value Jio Platforms, where Reliance last year announced it was consolidating its digital offerings, at roughly $65 billion. 
They also put Jio on track toward a goal Ambani described last year: an eventual listing that would mark a milestone for his effort to unite the digital offerings of his sprawling conglomerate, from set-top boxes to e-commerce and home automation.
Reliance declined to make Ambani, Asia's richest man, available for interview or respond to a detailed list of questions. 
But interviews with a dozen people familiar with the company's development efforts show how Reliance has pushed aggressive pricing for a one-stop digital commerce platform that incorporates features modeled on the American tech heavyweights it sees as rivals.
When Jio set out to launch a set-top box, it tasked a team with analysing – and in some cases replicating - some 100 features of an Apple TV set-top box last year, according to a person close to the project and internal Jio documents seen by Reuters. 
""Presentation and listing of menu items should be similar to Apple TV,"" one of the documents says, assigning the task a ""Priority 1"" rating.
One document compares the products' features, like average weight. Another includes instructions like ""Matching the background theme of Launcher (home screen) to that of Apple TV.""
Jio's set-top box comes included in its broadband plans, with the cheapest annual deal costing around $110, whereas Apple TV 4K is selling for around $210 to $230 on Indian e-commerce sites.
Apple Inc (O:AAPL) did not respond to requests for comment.
Jio also analysed Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Alexa voice assistant with the aim of coming up with its own offering, according to one person with knowledge of Jio's strategy. ""They wanted to say: 'Hey Jio, can you switch on the lights?',"" said the person. Reuters could not determine the status of the project. Amazon declined comment. 
In other areas, Ambani has shown a willingness to bet big on emerging technology. In India, Jio was an early adopter of voice-over-LTE, which is more efficient than traditional networks. The company expects that to give it an edge in rolling out 5G services.
""Few companies have the potential to transform a country's digital ecosystem in the way that Jio Platforms is doing in India,"" said KKR's co-founder Henry Kravis in announcing his investment. 
In partnership with Facebook's WhatsApp, Reliance has launched a new service that allows consumers to order from their local grocery stores at a time when many Indian consumers, like shoppers elsewhere, are trying to minimize trips to stores. The service was rolled out in April in three areas of Greater Mumbai. 
""Reliance wants to be a global technology powerhouse,"" said Rahul Malhotra, an analyst with Bernstein. ""With the Facebook partnership, they will build the WeChat of India,"" he added, referring to Tencent Holdings' (HK:0700) messaging, payments and social media app that is ubiquitous in China.
TOTAL RELIANCE
Ambani dominates a dizzying array of sectors: Jio is India's leading telecoms carrier, Reliance Retail Limited is its top brick-and-mortar retailer, Reliance's Network18 Media & Investments Limited is one of its biggest news networks, and Reliance's Jamnagar is its largest oil complex.
His empire also produces films at Jio Studios and runs India's top soccer tournament, the Indian Super League.
By providing Indian consumers access to everything from groceries and clothes to banking and home automation via an integrated system running through Jio, Ambani hopes Reliance can become what he calls an ""everything company.""
To help back its retail push, Reliance in March asked an Indian logistics provider for some 5 million square feet of warehousing space, according to a person briefed on the plans.
That comes after a 2019 request for service, reviewed by Reuters, that said the company was seeking 1.1 million square feet of warehousing space that would be ""expandable in future."" 
Reliance has not made public details of its warehousing space. By comparison, Amazon said in 2017 it had warehouses covering about 3 million square feet in India and has expanded since then. Amazon did not provide Reuters with an updated figure.
In addition to an eventual listing for Jio, Ambani has said he would look to list Reliance's retail operations as well.
Jio's other planned offerings include home viewings for films on the day of their theater release and networked security systems for cars.
But Jio's broadband rollout, which is key for many of its planned digital offerings, has hit glitches, in part because the company had not initially set up sufficient customer support services, according to two employees and internal chat messages reviewed by Reuters. And unlike in telecoms, Reliance has not offered steep discounts to attract new customers. 
Ambani's ambition of creating a homegrown tech company took shape when Jio was launched in 2016 with aggressively priced data plans. Suddenly, migrant construction workers were video-chatting with their families, farmers were checking crop prices, and office workers were screening films during their commutes home on crammed trains.
Jio's competitors, then numbering around a dozen, were forced to slash prices, quit, or merge as Reliance pumped in at least $30 billion in oil-related earnings to subsidize prices. ""We have to bleed others to death - I remember that as a refrain,"" said one former high-level Reliance executive, who asked not to be named.
Some rivals held out for longer than expected and Reliance ended up investing more than originally planned, according to a half-dozen sources who worked at Reliance or were briefed on the company's ramp-up.

Last year, Jio became India's No. 1 carrier by number of users. Meanwhile, rival  Vodafone  (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea Ltd (NS:VODA), a venture between the Indian unit of Britain's Vodafone Group Plc (L:VOD) and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla's  Idea Cellular , has warned it may not survive having to pay about $4 billion in overdue levies and interest to the government.

TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian shares rose to a two-month high on Thursday as government stimulus expectations supported investor confidence in an economic recovery from the global coronavirus pandemic.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4%, earlier touching the highest since March 9.
Shares in Australia rose 0.66% after the country's prime minister unveiled a fourth stimulus package to repair the economy.
Chinese shares were little changed due to lingering worries about diplomatic tension between the United States and China, while U.S. stock futures fell 0.23%.
The euro held onto gains before a European Central Bank meeting later on Thursday, where policymakers are expected to increase debt purchases to support the bloc's weakest economies.
Oil prices fell, reversing gains made the previous session, due to uncertainty about supply cuts by major producers.
Markets for risk assets have been on a tear, carrying some stock market indexes to within sight of levels before the coronavirus outbreak.
The Nasdaq Composite,, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average are close to overtaking all-time closing highs registered in February. 
""Liquidity provision by central banks – and expectations that more is coming – is helping to support the recent drive in risk markets,"" ANZ Research senior economist Liz Kendall and strategist David Croy, said in a note early on Thursday.
Elsewhere in Asia, Japanese shares snapped a three-day winning streak and fell 0.06%.
Hong Kong's stock market gave up early gains and traded 0.12% lower due to concerns about Beijing's plans for a new national security law for the former British colony.
The euro held near multi-month highs in Asia amid growing expectations the ECB will increase the size of its 750 billion euro ($669 billion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme, when it meets on Thursday.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year eased slightly to 0.7425% in Asia on Thursday.
A closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes, reached 55 basis points on Wednesday, the steepest level since mid-March. A steepening curve often points to a stronger economy.
Governments around the world have gradually started to lift tough lockdown measures imposed to contain the coronavirus which has infected nearly 6.4 million people and killed over 379,000.
Markets await Friday's U.S. Labor Department May jobs report, which is expected to show the unemployment rate soaring to a post-World War Two high of nearly 20% from 14.7% in April.
On Wednesday, a report showed U.S. private payrolls fell less than expected in May, suggesting layoffs were abating as businesses reopen.

The Straits Times Index entered a technical bull market Wednesday, climbing more than 20% from its March 23 low. While the benchmark gauge is still down more than 15% this year, bullish option bets and record flows in an exchange-traded fund tracking local stocks show sentiment is improving.
UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS) became the latest fan of the Southeast Asian nation’s shares, upgrading its view to overweight in a report Thursday, citing the reopening of global economies, a recovery in oil prices, attractive valuations and the government’s ability to contain the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Singapore stocks are “somewhat cyclical and should benefit from exports and/or oil prices recovering,” said strategists led by Niall MacLeod. The valuations are also “attractive versus the region,” the note added.
Global stocks climbed for eighth straight days through Wednesday on optimism for a quick economic recovery from the virus impact. Technical indicators and valuations are flashing warning signs, however, and the possibility of a second wave of infections poses a threat along with renewed U.S.-China tensions and unrest in U.S. cities.
Singapore’s gross domestic product is expected to shrink 4%-7% this year, its worst contraction since independence in 1965, as the pandemic pummels the economy. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has promised to provide sufficient liquidity, while the government has deployed stimulus of S$92.9 billion ($66 billion) so far.
The Singapore government has greater ability than many other nations to support its economy due to its reserves, the UBS strategists wrote in their note. “Therefore non-performing loan risks may be lower than elsewhere.”
While the city-state struggles to flatten the curve of the coronavirus pandemic even as it reopens its economy, UBS said that the number of new cases “is slowing and looks manageable.”

Stocks had enjoyed an almost week-long rally, fueled by investor optimism over the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
Tensions between the two countries rose overnight after the U.S. suspended flights into the U.S. by Chinese airlines effective from June 16, the latest tit-for-tat over China approved the enactment of national security laws in Hong Kong and Macau last month.
The suspension was the U.S. response to an earlier Chinese move to bar American carriers from re-entering China.

Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.13%, with tension in the city rising ahead of the Legislative Council’s passing of the National Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) bill later in the day.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Air New Zealand Ltd (NZ:AIR) on Thursday outlined plans for significant boosts to domestic capacity as pandemic-related travel restrictions ease, sending their shares higher.
Qantas said it would lift domestic capacity to 15% of pre-pandemic levels by the end of June, up from 5% now. 
The airline said more flights are likely in July depending on travel demand and further opening of state borders, with the ability to increase to up to 40% of pre-crisis capacity by the end of July.
Air New Zealand said it would raise domestic capacity to 55% of normal levels during July and August, up from 20% after a strict nationwide lockdown was lifted in May.
Qantas shares were trading 5% higher at 0240 GMT, while Air New Zealand shares were up 4.8%. Australia and New Zealand have both reported few new COVID-19 cases in recent weeks.
Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said there was pent-up demand for domestic air travel.
""We are already seeing a big increase in customers booking and planning flights in the weeks and months ahead,"" he said in a statement. 
The initial Qantas increase equates to more than 300 return flights a week. 
Australia's most populous state, New South Wales, allowed residents to travel for leisure within the state from June 1.
Qantas and low-cost arm Jetstar are adding flights from Sydney to Ballina, near the popular tourist destination of Byron Bay in the state's north, with Jetstar advertising flexible one-way sale fares from A$35 ($24.13).
But Queensland, a favoured destination in the southern hemisphere winter due to its warmer weather, has so far kept it state borders closed.
Joyce said Qantas could ramp up flying quickly in time for the July school holidays if border restrictions eased.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance on Wednesday that allows private equity investments to be offered to U.S. retirement plans as part of diversified investment funds, a move that the leveraged buyout industry has long called for.
Employee-sponsored defined benefit plans, such as the pension funds of public sector workers, have long been allowed to include buyout funds in their investment portfolios, turning private equity into a multi-trillion-dollar industry.
But managers of defined contribution plans, including 401(k) plans, stayed cleared of private equity investments, uncertain whether federal rules allowed them to include them in their portfolios and fearful of the risk of litigation.
The Department of Labor said on Wednesday that direct contribution plans are allowed to invest in private equity funds offered through professionally managed vehicles such as target-date, target-risk or balanced funds. The funds must include private equity only as one of component of their portfolio, the Department of Labor said.
The new guidance, issued in response to a request for clarification by investments firms Pantheon Ventures and Partners Group, is aimed at helping Americans saving for retirement gain access to alternative investments that often provide strong returns, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia said in a statement.
It comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May directing federal agencies to eliminate ""unnecessary regulations that impede economic recovery.""
The new guidance gives the private equity industry access to 401(k) plans, which have over $6 trillion in assets, said Robert Collins, a managing director at Partners Group.
But it's unclear how quickly and to what extent large mutual fund managers and other fiduciaries of retirement assets will add private equity to their portfolios. The shares of major publicly listed private equity firms, such as Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) and KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR), were up only in line with the wider stock market on Wednesday, indicating tempered investor enthusiasm over the impact of the change.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been sued for allegedly fostering the spread of the coronavirus by mandating unsafe working conditions, causing at least one employee to contract COVID-19, bring it home, and see her cousin die.
The complaint was filed on Wednesday in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, by three employees of the JFK8 fulfillment center in Staten Island, and by family members.
One employee, Barbara Chandler, said she tested positive for COVID-19 in March and later saw several household members become sick, including a cousin who died on April 7.
The lawsuit said Amazon has made JFK8, which employs about 5,000, a ""place of danger"" by impeding efforts to stop the coronavirus spreading, boosting productivity at the expense of safety.
It said Amazon forces employees to work at ""dizzying speeds, even if doing so prevents them from socially distancing, washing their hands, and sanitizing their work spaces."" 
Amazon did not comment on the lawsuit, but said it has always followed guidance from health authorities and its workplace safety experts since the coronavirus pandemic began.
The Seattle-based company has benefited as the pandemic forced many consumers unable to visit physical stores to shop online more.
Unions, elected officials and some employees have faulted Amazon's treatment of workers, including the firing of some critical of warehouse conditions.
Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said last week that Amazon has not fired people for such criticism.
Amazon is spending more than $800 million on coronavirus safety in this year's first half, including cleaning, temperature checks and face masks.
At least 800 workers in U.S. distribution centers have tested positive for COVID-19, according to an employee's unofficial tally.
Amazon ended 2019 with 798,000 full- and part-time employees.
The lawsuit seeks an injunction requiring that Amazon comply with worker safety and public nuisance laws, and not punish employees who develop COVID-19 symptoms or are quarantined.

Last November, Australian regulator AUSTRAC filed a civil lawsuit, accusing the bank of presiding over 23 million payments that violated anti-money laundering protocols, including those made by Australians to child pornography purveyors in the Philippines.
The country's second-largest bank last month admitted to charges of breaching money laundering laws, but denied accusations it enabled illegal payments between known child sex offenders.
Unclear accountabilities as well as a lack of understanding and expertise caused compliance failures, the company said in a statement.
The bank, which concluded its investigation into issues raised by AUSTRAC, said that the failure to correctly report international transfer of funds was due to a mix of technology and human error going back more than a decade. 
""Consequences that have been applied to individuals include significant remuneration impacts and disciplinary actions,"" Westpac Chief Executive Officer Peter King said. ""A number of relevant staff had already left the company."" 
The allegations from the regulator have led to a string of senior management changes at the company, including the chief executive and chairman roles. Earlier this week, the bank announced that the head of its institutional bank was retiring.
A report from the advisory panel review into the charges noted that the directors could have recognised the systemic nature of the crimes the bank was facing earlier.

Westpac said it would continue to engage with AUSTRAC on the legal process.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Meatpacker JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) has been ordered by a judge to rehire indigenous workers fired from a slaughterhouse in the state of Santa Catarina last month, according to an injunction seen by Reuters on Wednesday. 
""The dismissals were discriminatory,"" Labor Judge Adilton Detoni said in the decision
In addition to ordering that the workers be rehired, he ordered the payment of salaries from the day they were laid off until they are reinstated.
JBS, which declined to comment on the injunction, confirmed on Tuesday firing 40 indigenous workers from its plant in the town of Seara on May 6, citing a decision to discontinue a bus service that brought them to the plant everyday.
The company has denied any discrimination against the indigenous workforce.
JBS said it employs 3,700 people at the plant, including 200 indigenous workers from surrounding areas. 
Detoni's ruling also determined JBS should quarantine the indigenous workers, as foreseen in an ordinance issued on May 12 by Santa Catarina state authorities related to measures to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus at meatpackers in the state.

Under the ordinance, meatpackers are under obligation to send workers from risk groups on paid leave, including indigenous employees, pregnant women, people over 60 years old and workers with pre-existing diseases.

The New York-headquartered bank has reached out to dozens of recent college graduates who received offers to join the first-year investment banking analyst class in a few weeks to inform them about the offers, one of the people said.
Evercore is proposing two options: postpone the start date until January 2021 and receive a payment of $15,000 or wait a full year and start in July 2021 and be paid $25,000, one of the sources said.
The bank declined to comment.
The Wall Street Journal first reported the news.
The offer, which is said to be the first of its kind where a Wall Street bank is offering cash for people to stay away for a while, comes as much of Wall Street has been working from home to help stop the spread of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.
It also comes at a time when U.S. unemployment claims have surged past 40 million during the pandemic and many big employers ranging from Boeing (NYSE:BA) to Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) are cutting their workforces as the country braces for a deep recession.
Evercore traditionally hires roughly 90 recent college graduates to join its multi-year training program. The base salary is said to be around $85,000 with the chance to make another $50,000 to $85,000 in bonus in the following year, one of the sources said.
One of the people who was set to start is now considering taking the offer to take time for travel, pursue hobbies, and think about life after Wall Street even before life on Wall Street can officially begin, according to an email seen by Reuters.
Wall Street's training programs are rigorous, giving the junior bankers a foundation in financial analysis while logging long hours in the office. Evercore along with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) is a particularly desirable place to work.
Reasons for the delay could range from an expected decline in business like mergers to wanting to provide better training for the class of analysts when people begin returning to the office, said Anthony Keizner, a partner at search firm Odyssey Search Partners. ""But the summer boat cruises and the drinks with the trading floor are clearly not going to happen.""

(Reuters) - LVMH (PA:LVMH) CEO Bernard Arnault is exploring ways to reopen negotiations on the French luxury goods giant's $16.2 billion acquisition of U.S. jewelry chain  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF), as U.S. social unrest and the coronavirus pandemic weigh on the retail sector, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
LVMH agreed to acquire Tiffany in November, but the deal has yet to close, pending regulatory approvals. Arnault said at the time Tiffany would ""thrive for centuries to come"" under LVMH.
Arnault has been in talks with his advisers this week to identify ways to pressure Tiffany to lower the agreed price of $135 per share in cash, the sources said. He is considering whether he can argue that the New York-based company is in breach of its obligations under the merger agreement, they said.
LVMH has not yet settled on a strategy to pursue a deal price cut and has not asked Tiffany to reopen negotiations, according to the sources. It is not clear whether it will do so and what arguments it could pursue. 
Tiffany does not believe there is a legal basis to renegotiate the deal, the sources said. The company is in compliance with financial covenants under the merger agreement with LVMH, and expects to remain so after declaring a quarterly dividend two weeks ago, the sources said. 
The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations, first reported on Tuesday by fashion trade publication WWD, are confidential. 
LVMH declined to comment. Tiffany did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tiffany shares ended down 2.4% at $114.24 on Wednesday, a 15% discount to the $135 per deal share price. LVMH shares earlier ended trading in Paris up 2.2% at 393.45 euros ($442). 
While Arnault now has concerns about overpaying for Tiffany, he still believes in the deal's strategic rationale, according to the sources. Tiffany will give LVMH a bigger share of the lucrative U.S. market and expand its offerings in jewelry, the fastest-growing sector in the luxury goods industry.
If Tiffany rebuffs an LVMH bid to reopen the deal, the dispute could end up in Delaware court, the sources said. An acrimonious end to the deal would make it more difficult for LVMH to make another attempt at acquiring Tiffany in the future, they said.
Several acquirers have walked away from or renegotiated deals in the wake of the pandemic. In the retail sector, private equity firm Sycamore Partners walked away from a $525 million deal to acquire a majority stake in L Brands Inc's (N:LB) Victoria’s Secret.
Consultancy Bain expects global sales of high-end clothing, handbags, jewelry and cosmetics to fall by up to 35% this year, as the health crisis has forced brands to shut shops across the globe and international travel has ground to a halt. 
The deteriorating market conditions have been compounded for Tiffany and other retailers by the protests and attacks on shops that have followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of police on May 25.

The brand, founded in 1837 and known for its signature robin's-egg-blue boxes, was already in turnaround mode as it tries to rejuvenate its image and attract shoppers online.

It was not immediately clear how large the write-down would be. In a May filing, B3 said it had lost a lower court ruling, in which regulators challenged how the company calculated amortization resulting from the merger.
B3 said at the time the value of that challenged tax assessment was 1.3 billion reais ($257 million). 
The company said on Wednesday it had filed an appeal against the court's decision.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Virtu Financial (O:VIRT), one of the world's biggest trading and market making firms, is looking at alternatives to having all its employees work from an office once stay-at-home orders due to the coronavirus have been lifted, its chief executive said on Wednesday.
About 95% of around 1,000 Virtu employees were working from home due to the pandemic when the company reported earnings in early May.
Now, after coming through one of the most volatile and highest-volume periods in financial markets history without any major issues, the company is rethinking its real-estate footprint, CEO Doug Cifu said via webcast at an industry conference held by Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR).
""I think every firm is struggling with that,"" he said. ""I mean, I know for sure that our costs for real estate are going to go down precipitously, because I'm not going to pay for 80,000 square feet in downtown Manhattan when I don't have to.""
Virtu, which has offices in cities including New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, London and Paris, surveyed staff on their thoughts and concerns about returning to the office, and around 75% of those in the New York area said they did not want to get back on mass transit, Cifu said.
Around 35% said they would be happy to potentially work from home, so Virtu is considering the alternatives, he added.
""Is it better if we had a small but larger cadre of people in the office? Yes, but I have told our people I'm not risking anybody's health or welfare to make a buck,"" Cifu said from Virtu's New York office, where he said six other people were also working.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks staged a rally Wednesday after better-than-expected economic data suggested the worst of the economic hit from the global health pandemic may be over.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged more than 500 points and the broader S&P 500 is up 2% for the first three days of June, a sharp about-face from its recent decline. Businesses have begun to reopen and restrictions on individuals have loosened as states and cities try to restart their economies.
Among the items to watch for Thursday are additional jobs data, corporate earnings, and another stock debut.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Weekly Unemployment Claims Seen Continuing Multiweek Trend
Weekly initial jobless claims are expected to come in at 1.8 million when the Labor Department reports on Thursday. That is lower than 2.1 million reported last week and a solid sign of continued improvement. On Wednesday, ADP's (NASDAQ:ADP) monthly payroll report beat expectations.
While joblessness spiked sharply after business shutdowns forced tens of millions out of their jobs amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the trend has been heading lower since the worst week at the end of March, when a record 6.9 million workers filed initial jobless claims. So far, more than 40 million Americans have filed unemployment claims.
Jobless claims arrive at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
2. Earnings Reports Due From Broadcom and Gap
Chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and casual apparel retailer Gap (NYSE:GPS) are scheduled to report quarterly profit tomorrow.
Broadcom shares have rallied strongly since March and have gotten attention this week from a couple of positive analyst reports ahead of earnings. Analysts are forecasting per-share profit of $5.14, on revenue of $5.7 billion.
Gap is reporting fiscal first-quarter earnings after the closing bell. The Covid-19 shutdowns across the globe are expected to weigh on its numbers, with analysts estimating a 59 cent-per-share loss on sales of $2.3 billion after a strong prior quarter.
3. Another IPO Set to Begin Trading
Zoominfo, a maker of software that aids companies in sales and marketing – and not to be confused with the popular videoconferencing service of a similar name – continues this week's streak of public stock debuts.
The company is set to begin trading under the ticker ""ZI"" after raising nearly $1 billion in an initial public offering this week. Also this week, Warner Music launched its $1.8 billion IPO."

The 3-billion-euro sales company, which produces and sells a wide range of beverages including Martini vermouth and Bombay Sapphire gin, has called a shareholder meeting on June 18 to appoint its 14-member board. 
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the widow of Don Luis Bacardi -- who was the great-grandson of the spirits group's founder -- said Liechtestein-based Bastille Trust had denied her the right to vote at the shareholder meeting.
The trust, which was founded by Don Luis Bacardi, controls two companies which hold a 6% stake in Bacardi LTD. 
In the statement, Monika Bacardi said she was against the list of candidates put forward by the chairman of Bacardi LTD, Facundo Bacardi, adding she would deny her support for that list, being an obstacle to his reappointment at the June 18 meeting.
""Bacardi LTD is the only multinational in the world where the majority of shareholders are represented by trusts whose trustees vote against the instructions of the trusts' beneficiaries, unconditionally supporting the current leadership team,"" she said.

Bermuda-based Bacardi LTD declined to comment on the issue.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street rallied broadly on Wednesday with the Nasdaq approaching record highs as signs of an economic recovery from mandated shutdowns helped investors look beyond U.S. social unrest and pandemic worries.
Financials, industrials and tech pushed the three major U.S. stock indexes well into the black. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq each posted their fourth straight day of solid gains.
The Nasdaq, the S&P 500 and the Dow have rebounded sharply from March lows hit as coronavirus-related lockdowns shocked the stock market, and they are now 1.4%, 7.8%, and 11.1%, respectively, away from overtaking all-time closing highs set in February.
The Nasdaq 100 (NDX) is now just over 0.1% below its February record, having briefly breached that level late in the session. 
""There is growing confidence the U.S. economy can safely re-open, much as other economies such as China and Italy have successfully done,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""Risk appetite for equities has been helped by optimism in the economy, as well as investors having few other alternatives.""
Nationwide protests over the death of an unarmed black man in police custody extended to an eighth night as protesters ignored curfews, but violence subsided after President Donald Trump threatened to deploy the military.
A spate of grim economic data was not as bad as economists feared, with ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) reporting many fewer private-sector job cuts in May than expected.
Market participants now await the U.S. Labor Department's more comprehensive May jobs report, which is expected to show unemployment soaring to a historic 19.7%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 527.24 points, or 2.05%, to 26,269.89, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 42.05 points, or 1.36%, to 3,122.87 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 74.54 points, or 0.78%, to 9,682.91.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but healthcare (SPXHC) closed in positive territory, with industrials (SPLRCI) and financials (SPSY) enjoying the biggest percentage gains.
 Boeing Co  (N:BA) gave the biggest boost to the blue-chip Dow, its shares rising 12.9% following news that billionaire investor Daniel Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) had taken a stake in the company.
 Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) jumped 8.7% after the ride-sharing platform reported rides increased 26% in May.
 Microchip Technology Inc  (O:MCHP) surged 12.3% after the chipmaker raised its forecast for current-quarter sales and profit.
Teleconferencing firm Zoom Communications Inc (O:ZM) nearly doubled its annual sales expectations, but also reported a sharp rise in costs. Its shares were up 7.6%.
Cosmetics maker  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) rose 13.4% after announcing it was in talks to collaborate on a beauty line with reality TV star Kim Kardashian West.
 Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) beat earnings expectations and hiked its full-year forecast, but troubles meeting surging consumer demand sent its shares down 6.1%.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.81-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.26-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 96 new highs and four new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.48 billion shares, compared with the 11.45 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers still needs to reform and a federal takeover remains an option, the U.S. prosecutor leading the investigation of corruption within the union told Reuters on Wednesday after the UAW's former president pleaded guilty to embezzlement.
""The union needs to change quite simply,"" Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said in an interview, adding a possible takeover of the UAW ""absolutely"" remained an option.
""There's a more urgent need to reform the union and fix it,"" Schneider said. ""I'm pretty much at the end of my patience.""
Former UAW president Gary Jones pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges he embezzled more than $1 million of union funds. Schneider said he wants to meet as soon as possible with UAW President Rory Gamble as the investigation moves into a ""new stage.""
Gamble on Wednesday said the actions of Jones and others involved ""were selfish, immoral and against everything we stand for as a union."" 
UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said Gamble looks forward to meeting with Schneider. 
""The UAW has made significant changes since Mr. Jones resigned and continues to look at ways to reform,"" Rothenberg said. 
In 1988, the U.S. Justice Department sued to force out senior leaders at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union and appointed a trustee because of the union's connection to organized crime. The government oversaw the union from March 1989 until 2015, and a five-year transition period followed.
One option Schneider said he would like the UAW to explore is the direct election of officers to make them more accountable. UAW officers are currently elected through delegates.
Jones, 63, entered his guilty plea during a videoconference hearing held by the U.S. District Court in Detroit.
""I apologize to my UAW family for the betrayal of their trust and pray they will forgive me,"" Jones said during the hearing.
Judge Paul Borman set a sentencing date of Oct. 6. Jones, who remains free on bail, agreed to cooperate with the government in the prosecution of others, which could lessen his sentence.
Jones, a certified public accountant, was charged with conspiracy to embezzle funds from the UAW from 2010 through September 2019, and with conspiracy to defraud the United States by failing to pay taxes on the money prosecutors charge he stole. He resigned from the union last November.

The sides agreed to a sentencing guideline range of 46 to 57 months for Jones.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>","Fed expands municipal liquidity program to include transit, airports, utilities","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it will allow governors of U.S. states to designate transit agencies, airports, utilities and other institutions to borrow under its municipal liquidity program as the central bank tries to mitigate economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
Governors will be able to designate two issuers in their states whose revenues are generally derived from operating so-called government activities, the Fed said in a statement.
The central bank also said it is expanding its program to allow all U.S. states to be able to have at least two cities or counties eligible to directly issue notes to the municipal liquidity facility regardless of population.
Currently only U.S. states and cities with a population of at least 250,000 residents or counties with a population of at least 500,000 residents have been able to make use of the $500 billion short-term borrowing program.
The Fed has come under pressures to expand its population criteria from lawmakers whose states have no local governments that met the population thresholds.
New York's hard-hit Metropolitan Transportation Authority last month asked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for direct access to the program.
Even with the expansion of potential users, demand may be low given the cost.
""It's been less a question of eligibility and more of a question of pricing,"" said William Glasgall, director of state and local initiatives at the Volcker Alliance.
Recent sample purchase rates from the New York Fed range from 1.51% for the highest-rated governments to 3.84% for those with the lowest investment-grade ratings.

On Tuesday, Illinois became the first state or local government to tap the Fed's program with a $1.2 billion borrowing. Analysts have said the program, announced in April, was set up to be the lender of last resort and would make the most sense for lower-rated governments.

714,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>",Corporate activists flex muscles again with more campaigns in May: Lazard data,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Corporate agitators who had tread lightly as the deadly coronavirus spread in March and April stepped up the pressure on global corporations by launching 16 new campaigns in May, including five in Japan, data from  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) show.
The campaigns in May are double the number in April and bring the total to 83 in the first five months of 2020. But the pace is off monthly averages seen before the novel coronavirus outbreak, the investment bank which tracks the data said on Wednesday. The data will be released later in the day.
Activists are putting ""money to work to take advantage of attractive valuations while they last,"" said Jim Rossman, who heads shareholder advisory at Lazard. Near term, he said activity will remain subdued but there could be a ""strong resurgence in activism in the second half of the year.""
Investors like Elliott Management and Oasis Management took on companies ranging from CenterPoint Energy (NYSE:CNP) to Mitsubishi Logistics, illustrating fresh trends in finding partners for campaigns, and targeted Japanese companies long thought to be off limits.
Elliott teamed up with mutual funds Fidelity, MFS and Capital Group to back energy delivery company CenterPoint Energy with $1.4 billion, while Oasis called for share buybacks and the election of new board members at Japan's Mitsubishi Logistics last month.
In April, Lazard said activist investors would likely scale back campaigns as target companies brace for a deep recession.
But as markets recovered from dramatic virus-sparked sell-offs -- the benchmark U.S. Standard & Poor's 500 average is now down 6% after sinking roughly 30% earlier in the year -- the landscape has improved for corporate agitators.

Investing.com – The Dow climbed for the third-straight session as hopes of a faster economic recovery were given a boost on Wednesday amid signs the Covid-19 pandemic's grip on the economy has passed.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.05%, or 527 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.36%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.78%.
With just days to go until Friday's crucial nonfarm payrolls report, ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) said that private payrolls fell by 2.76 million jobs in May, confounding economists' expectations for a drop of 9 million.
That marked a significant improvement from the 19.5 million job cuts seen in April, raising hopes the labor market losses have bottomed.
The services sector, which accounts for about two-thirds of overall economic growth, is also showing signs of life, with activity rising from the lowest level in 11 years in April.
Institute for Supply Management data for May showed a reading of 45.4, above forecasts for a reading of 44.
The duo of upbeat economic reports stoked investor hopes of a quicker economic rebound, underpinning cyclical sectors like financials and industrials.  
Financials jumped 4.4%, with banks leading the charge. JPMorgan (NYSE:NYSE:JPM) was up 5.4%, Bank of America (NYSE:NYSE:BAC) up 4.5% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:NYSE:C) up 4.9%.
In industrials, Boeing (NYSE:BA) rallied 13% after reaching a compensation package and a new delivery deal with travel company TUI Group over the grounding of its 737 Max planes.
On the earnings front,  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) jumped 6% after reporting first-quarter results that markedly beat expectations on the bottom and top lines as the pandemic spurred demand for its videoconferencing software.
Canada Goose (NYSE:GOOS) rose 18% after reporting a better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter profit. The outerwear retailer also said it would increase focus on direct-to-consumer sales in the early stages of the reopening phase.
Elsewhere, Warner Music (NASDAQ:WMG) made a bright start to life as a publicly-traded company, rallying 21%. The music label company had priced its offering of 77 million shares at $25 per share."
716,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>",Delta will extend social distancing through Sept. 30,"By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said on Wednesday it will extend social distancing measures on its flights through Sept. 30 and will block the selection of middle seats and cap seating in every cabin.
Reuters reported last month the airline would keep planes to no more than 60% full through at least July, adding more flights to its schedule than demand would usually justify, citing sources. The goal is to convince passengers worried about COVID-19 to return to flying.
The move is part of a longer-term bet that CEO Ed Bastian has highlighted to investors: Consumers' perceptions of safety will be instrumental in reviving more routine travel, and they will be willing to pay a premium for comfort.
“Reducing the overall number of customers on every aircraft across the fleet is one of the most important steps we can take to ensure a safe experience for our customers and people,” Delta's chief customer experience officer, Bill Lentsch, said.
Delta will cap seating at 50% in first class, 60% in other cabins and 75% in its exclusive Delta One cabins.
Social distancing on airplanes has become a topic of debate. The global industry's main group, IATA, has said airlines will not be able to make a profit if they limit planes to two-thirds of normal capacity unless they drastically increased airfares.
In the United States, the chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative Peter DeFazio, in May urged airlines to maintain at least one seat between all passengers and cap seating at 67% of capacity on narrow-body airplanes.

While major U.S. airlines' middle-seat policies differ, they all require passengers to wear facial coverings. Airlines have also endorsed the Transportation Security Administration's beginning temperature checks before passengers board planes, but the Trump administration has not yet endorsed the idea.

“It’s going to allow the excessive leverage -- which had already been building up into the system coming into this -- to continue, and to levels that are completely unprecedented in our history,” Minerd said at a virtual insurance conference Wednesday. That increases the risk a bubble in corporate bond markets “will just be extended and become more extreme.”
Policies by the Federal Reserve and Treasury have helped some companies in industries such as aviation and hospitality survive the economic collapse caused by the coronavirus lockdown, Minerd said. But in some cases, government actions have also prompted firms with too much debt to take on even more.
The Fed’s actions will eventually force it to face a “day of reckoning,” Minerd said in a Bloomberg Television interview after the conference.
Peter Gailliot, global chief investment officer of BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s financial institutions group, said at the conference that the Fed had tried to keep the moral hazard issue at bay. But “they’re crossing some lines, and it remains to be seen what other moral hazard or assumptions that investors might build into their investment process, in terms of how far the Fed might be willing to go,” he said.
Gailliot pointed to the central bank’s decision to add high-yield debt and so-called fallen angels to its balance sheet. He expects commercial real estate and distressed debt markets to face the most stress as the crisis persists, and expressed concern about the likelihood many companies will go out of business.
“We do have a fear that there is going to be much less of a stigma associated with bankruptcies and defaults than you’ve seen in the past,” Gailliot said.

“The ‘one country, two systems’ principle is core to the future success of Hong Kong and has always been the bedrock of business community’s confidence,” Standard Chartered said in an emailed statement Wednesday. “We hope greater clarity on the final legislative provisions will enable Hong Kong to maintain economic and social stability.”
Earlier in the day, HSBC Holdings (NYSE:HSBC) Plc’s top executive in Asia came out in support of China’s proposed security law, which has yet to be drafted but will likely cast doubt on whether Hong Kong still has the high degree of autonomy and independent judiciary promised before the British handed their colony back to Chinese control in 1997. Like HSBC, StanChart has a London head office but generates most of its earnings in Asia.
The British government has backed its former colony. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will give as many as three million Hong Kong residents the chance to seek refuge and a new life in the U.K. if China presses ahead.
StanChart makes more than a quarter of its revenue from Hong Kong, and like HSBC, its shares are traded on the Hong Kong exchange as well as in London. StanChart derived about 68% of its 2019 revenues from Asia, an even higher proportion than HSBC.

Pilgrim's Pride shares fell 14% around midday.
A grand jury in Denver indicted Jayson Penn, the president and CEO of Pilgrim's Pride (O:PPC), which is mostly owned by JBS USA Inc, as well as a former executive at the Colorado-based chicken supplier, the Justice Department said in a statement. Two executives from a Georgia chicken producer were also indicted.
""Executives who cheat American consumers, restaurateurs, and grocers, and compromise the integrity of our food supply, will be held responsible for their actions,"" said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. 
Pilgrim's Pride did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy ran from 2012 until at least early 2017, the department said.
In addition to Penn, the indicted executives were Roger Austin, a former Pilgrim vice president, as well as the president of Claxton Poultry, Mikell Fries, and Scott Brady (NYSE:BRC), a vice president at Claxton.
A spokesman for Claxton declined immediate comment, and a lawyer for the company could not immediately be reached. The individuals indicted also could not immediately be reached.

723,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>","Apple must face U.S. shareholder lawsuit over CEO's iPhone, China comments","By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A federal judge said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) must face part of a lawsuit claiming it fraudulently concealed falling demand for iPhones, especially in China, leading to tens of billions of dollars in shareholder losses.
While dismissing most claims, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers (NYSE:ROG) ruled late Tuesday that shareholders can sue over Chief Executive Tim Cook's comments touting strong iPhone demand on a Nov. 1, 2018 analyst call, only a few days before Apple told its largest manufacturers to curb production.
""Absent some natural disaster or other intervening reason, it is simply implausible that Cook would not have known that iPhone demand in China was falling mere days before cutting production lines,"" Rogers wrote.
The Oakland, California-based judge also said a decision by Apple to stop reporting iPhone unit sales ""plausibly suggests that defendants expected unit sales to decline.""
Apple did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.
The complaint, led by the Employees' Retirement System of the State of Rhode Island, came after Cook on Jan. 2, 2019 unexpectedly reduced Apple's quarterly revenue forecast by up to $9 billion, in part because of U.S.-China trade tensions.
It was the first time since the iPhone's 2007 launch that the Cupertino, California-based company had cut its revenue forecast. Apple stock fell 10% the next day, erasing $74 billion of market value.
Cook had said on the analyst call that the iPhone XS and XS Max had a ""really great start,"" and that while some emerging markets faced downward sales pressures ""I would not put China in that category.""
By mid-November 2018, Apple had told the manufacturers Foxconn and Pagatron to halt plans for new iPhone production lines, and a key supplier had been told to materially reduce shipments, the complaint said.

The case is In re Apple Inc Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 19-02033.

725,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>",New U.S. restrictions on 33 Chinese firms and institutions take effect June 5,"By David Shepardson and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S Commerce Department said on Wednesday that new restrictions on 33 Chinese firms and institutions it announced last month will take effect Friday.
The agency has added the companies and institutions to an economic blacklist, accusing them of helping China spy on its minority Muslim Uighur population in Xinjiang or because of alleged ties to weapons of mass destruction and China's military.
China's foreign ministry said last month it deplored and firmly opposed U.S. sanctions over Xinjiang, calling it a purely internal affair for China.
The move will restrict the sales of U.S. goods to the companies and institutions on the list, as well as certain items made abroad with U.S. content or technology. Companies can apply for licenses to make the sales, but they must overcome a presumption of denial.
Seven companies and two institutions were listed for being ""complicit in human rights violations and abuses committed in China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs"" and others, the Commerce Department said.
Two dozen other companies, government institutions and commercial organizations were added over Washington allegations that they supported procurement of items for use by the Chinese military.
The blacklisted companies focus on artificial intelligence and facial recognition, markets in which U.S. chip companies such as  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) and  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) have been heavily investing.
The new listings follow a similar October 2019 action, when the Department of Commerce added 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including some of China's top artificial intelligence startups and video surveillance company Hikvision (SZ:002415) - to a U.S. trade blacklist.

The actions follow the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] for what it says are national security reasons. Last month, the Department of Commerce took action to try to further cut off Huawei's access to U.S. chipmakers.

TORONTO (Reuters) -  Manulife Financial  (NYSE:MFC) Corp's (TO:MFC) chief executive said on Wednesday an environment of lower interest rates for longer is proving a challenge for the insurer, which did not expect the ""significant"" drop in long-term rates that has taken place.
""A new era of lower rates for longer is a new headwind we'll have to grapple with,"" Roy Gori said at the S&P Global Insurance Conference. ""When we did our planning for 2020 and 2021, we never really anticipated the significant drop in the longer end of the curve as much as we’ve actually seen.""
Global insurance companies are seeing plunging yields slam investment returns, while the pandemic has boosted some payout expenses.
Manulife last month reported a 40% drop in first-quarter profit.
The decline in rates has required Manulife to respond by changing pricing and products and increasing efficiency, in part through increased technology adoption, he said.
Manulife has done more to advance digitization in the past five months than in the previous five years, and more than 90% of products can now be sold digitally, Gori said.
Gori said Manulife's operations outside North America, particularly in Asia, have helped cushion some of the impact of low rates.
With different Asian markets are at different points on the yield curve, ""you start to appreciate the benefits of global diversity,"" he said.
Gori cautioned that volatility, particularly in equity markets, will continue until a coronavirus vaccine is developed and deployed.
Gori also said 90% of Manulife's employees in China and 50% in Hong Kong have returned to offices. That contrasts with its North American operations, where 98% of staff are still working from home.
Manulife shares rose 4.1% to a seven-month high of C$18.50 on Wednesday, compared with a 1.1% gain in the Toronto stock benchmark (GSPTSE).

732,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>",Gilead's remdesivir could see $7 billion in annual sales on stockpiling boost: analyst,"By Saumya Joseph
(Reuters) -  Gilead Sciences Inc 's (O:GILD) potential COVID-19 treatment, remdesivir, could bring in more than $7 billion in annual sales by 2022, spurred by governments stockpiling the drug to guard against future outbreaks, SVB Leerink said on Wednesday.
Remdesivir has shown improvement in COVID-19 patients in clinical trials and has been cleared for emergency use in severely ill patients in the United States, India and South Korea. Some European nations are using it in compassionate use.
The U.S. drugmaker is yet to set a price for the drug that is currently being administered intravenously in hospitals.
SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges, who upgraded his rating on Gilead's shares to ""outperform"", estimates remdesivir to be priced at $5,000 per course in the United States, $4,000 per course in Europe and around $2,000 in other markets.
The estimate comes a month after Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review suggested a price of $4,500 per U.S. treatment course for 10 days.
Remdesivir is yet to win a formal U.S. approval and Porges said commercial sales of the drug could begin later this year. He expects government stockpiling to begin late next year and said half of the forecasted sales of nearly $7.7 billion in 2022 could come from stockpiling contracts.
""We do forecast gradual adoption of vaccination, but in our view that is unlikely to stop government stockpiling of remdesivir,"" Porges wrote in a client note.
Last month, brokerage SunTrust Robinson Humphrey estimated global sales of the drug to be around $3 billion by 2022. That assumes a U.S. price of around $10,000 per treatment course, but potential competition from other therapies and vaccines.

Given the vast number of COVID-19 infections, pricing remdesivir at around $1,000 per course could still mean over $1 billion in revenue, brokerage Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) had said last month.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Top executives of the Detroit Three automakers and other major Michigan employers on Wednesday condemned racism and injustice in the United States following the death last week of an unarmed black man at the hands of Minneapolis police, carefully joining a charged national debate.
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co Executive Chairman Bill Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) North America Chief Operating Officer Mark Stewart were among the nine executives who called for independent prosecution of those involved in Floyd's death, and agreed to invest in programs and policies to help transform communities with racial disparities.
""We unequivocally condemn intolerance,"" Barra said at the event at Detroit's municipal office which was livestreamed. ""When hatred exists in our house, we will root it out.""
Barra said inclusion would be GM's guiding principle, and called on GM employees to speak up and tell her what needs to be done. ""We want to be part of meaningful, deliberate change,"" she said. ""We will act."" Barra said earlier this week she will form a new ""inclusion advisory board"" to advise the company's top executives.
FCA's Stewart called Floyd's death ""senseless"" and said the tolerance for social injustice was at an end.
""I say to you today, no more,"" he said. 
The auto executives join a wide range of senior figures across Corporate America who are condemning Floyd's death as tens of thousands of people have protested, sometimes violently, in cities across the United States and elsewhere.
None of the executives mentioned President Donald Trump, who has threatened to deploy the military to put down the protests. A Reuters poll released on Wednesday found that a majority of Americans disapproved of Trump's hard-line response. 
The issues raised by Floyd's death and the resulting protests have put pressure on CEOs from Silicon Valley to Wall Street to wade in to a charged and increasingly politicized debate.
Detroit's automakers must walk a fine line. They sell many of their pickup trucks, which generate most of their profits, in states that voted for Trump in 2016. The Trump administration has put pressure on the auto companies over issues ranging from fuel economy to plant shutdowns. 
At the same time, the auto companies have struggled with racial tensions in their U.S. factories, committed to increasing the diversity of their workforces, and are now trying to recruit technically skilled workers like those who protested  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg's decision not to take down inflammatory posts by Trump.
""There are no easy answers and we aren't interested in superficial actions,"" Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said during the appearance in Detroit.
""The recent tragic events remind us of how far we have yet to go,"" he added.

Others at the event included the heads of DTE Energy (NYSE:DTE) Co, TCF Financial (NYSE:TCF) Corp, Henry Ford Health System, Quicken Loans, Ilitch Holdings and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.

737,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>",‘Bored’ Millennials Boost Airline ETF to $1 Billion in Assets,"(Bloomberg) -- A once-obscure ETF tracking airlines soared past $1 billion, largely bolstered by day trading.
The US Global Jets exchange-traded fund, ticker JETS, posted its 64th consecutive day of inflows on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its growth has been staggering: The ETF held just $33 million in early March as the coronavirus pandemic grounded global air travel. The fund’s top holdings are the four major U.S. airlines, though it said last week that it will begin investing in Canadian carriers as well.
Much of that explosive growth in assets can be credited to day traders looking to “catch the bottom” in airline stocks, according to Frank Holmes, chief executive officer of JETS issuer U.S. Global Investors. After speaking with newly minted JETS holders, he says the boredom of being stuck at home and the strong rebound in carriers after the 2001 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis are luring young traders.
“All these millennials, being stuck at home with no bars to go to and no beaches to travel to, took their money and became day traders,” said Holmes. “They’re bored, they want to make money.”
In particular, the growing popularity of JETS on retail trading platform Robinhood has “shocked” Holmes. The number of users holding JETS surged to nearly 30,000 this week, according to Robintrack, a website unaffiliated with the site that uses its data to show trends in positioning. That compares to 500 at the beginning of March.
Not even a warning from billionaire investor Warren Buffett has deterred the army of day traders. Buffett said in early May that  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa) completely exited its positions in airlines, cautioning that the prospects have changed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Since then, JETS has taken in roughly $294 million worth of inflows.
Despite a nearly 21% rebound over the past month, JETS still nursing a year-to-date plunge of over 45%, compared to the S&P 500’s 2.8% 2020 drop. The bulk of the fund’s losses came after mid-February once lockdown measures took effect around the globe in an effort to contain the spread of infections.
JETS’s recent recovery has further evaporated demand to bet against it. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on JETS -- a rough indicator of bearish bets on the fund -- is currently 0.5%, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. It reached 7.8% in February 2019.
However, JETS’s methodology deserves a second look from investors pouring into the fund, according to DataTrek Research.
Instead of using a market-cap based weighting system employed by most sector-focused ETFs, JETS seeks to assign a 10% weighting to the top four largest U.S. or Canadian airline companies. Additionally, the fund doesn’t have Boeing (NYSE:BA), despite holding General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) and Airbus, co-founder Nicholas Colas noted.
“JETS may work from here, or it may not, but the important thing to know is that it’s not a passive fund with weightings based on market caps and it can entirely exclude mega-cap companies associated with air travel,” Colas wrote in a note Tuesday. “While the whole airline group may trade with a correlation of 1.0 for some time to come, you can’t just assume you know what’s in this product.”

739,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",Airlines Lose Billions of Dollars in the Oil-Market Casino,"(Bloomberg) -- Many of the world’s airlines already stung by the pandemic grounding flights are now finding out what a risky place the oil market can be.
Ten airlines in Europe and the Asia-Pacific -- where carriers tend to purchase oil derivatives to hedge against volatility in fuel prices -- have lost about $4.65 billion on those contracts this year, according to financial results compiled by Bloomberg through June 3.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY) and International Consolidated Airlines Group (LON:ICAG) SA account for about half the total.
The hedging strategies that European airlines routinely employ are “not effective in a crisis such as the one at the moment,” Lufthansa Chief Executive Officer Carsten Spohr said on an earnings call Wednesday. “But obviously who could have expected this?”
To guard against oil-price volatility, airlines can buy call options to shield them from soaring fuel costs. To cheapen the transaction, they often simultaneously sell put options, which can become costly if prices fall. As the pandemic unfolded, demand for fuel collapsed, with crude at one point plummeting to its lowest level in almost two decades. Carriers were left holding positions in oil contracts that weren’t needed as fuel consumption tanked, and no way to offset those costs with fleets grounded.
Lufthansa reported 925 million euros ($1.03 billion) in expenses related to hedging in its quarterly results. British Airways parent IAG last month posted a charge of about $1.5 billion. Others that have seen hedging-related losses this year include Dubai-based Emirates, Air France-KLM, EasyJet Plc and Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd.
The practice of hedging isn’t as common among U.S. airlines, following market gyrations in recent years. United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc. hasn’t hedged in several years and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc. has also said it doesn’t see the market opportunities to do so as being attractive.
Despite the losses, there’s little prospect of a change in tack among some carriers.
“We are hedging first, not to make money, but to absorb and smooth the shock in the fuel price,” Air France-KLM Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey said on an earnings call last month.

The sources said that the state's Department of Financial Services has an ongoing investigation into Deutsche involving Epstein and that a potential enforcement action could come as soon as this month.
Any action would be focused on the bank's failure to comply with state regulations and its own policies and procedures, one of the people said.
The status of the investigation was first reported by the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) on Tuesday.
In response, Deutsche Bank spokesman Daniel Hunter said: ""Our reputation is our most precious asset. We regret the decision to associate with Epstein,"" who was found dead in his jail cell in August 2019, an apparent suicide.

751,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",European lobbyists off the starting blocks in new tax race,"By Gabriela Baczynska
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's pitch for more taxes to repay coronavirus stimulus spending made corporate hackles raise, with lobbyists saying that new burdens would risk undercutting economic recovery from the pandemic. 
The EU's executive proposed new taxes to repay an unprecedented 750 billion euros of debt it would raise to channel the money to the 27 member states to help kickstart their battered economies.
The possible new levies - if agreed at all - could include a digital tax, a levy on carbon footprint of EU imports, a single market fee for large corporates, more proceeds from CO2 emissions from the aviation and maritime industries, as well as a fee on not-recycled plastic waste.
""We warn against new taxes for companies; these would be counterproductive and are damaging to Europe as an industrial location,"" said Thilo Brodtmann at Mechanical Engineering Industry Associaton VDMA, which represents around 3,300 firms in Germany and Europe, including Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) and Siemens.
Some, if not all of the mulled taxes could make the eventual mix, which would not take effect before 2024 at the earliest. While much detail is still missing, lobby groups are already pushing back. 
""We reject new taxes and levies on an EU level, such as digital and plastics taxes or additional levies on CO2. Burdening citizens and companies goes against Europe's economic recovery,"" said Joachim Lang, director general of the Federation of German Industries BDI.
The Commission's plan marks a fresh start in a debate that has already seen some ideas previously fail to win the unanimous support of EU governments. 
Frustrated, some countries decided to go alone. France, the Czech Republic, Italy, Spain and several others have either already introduced a digital tax or announced plans to do so. 
""That has been in the air for a while,"" said a tech lobbyist in Brussels. ""Where we would still need to engage is to push for a harmonized rate of any tax across Europe - for now it's too disjointed."" 
For now, differences of opinion persist even within the Commission, which said harvesting some 0.2% of the turnover of the largest global firms that earn on the EU market could yield 10 billion euros a year.
While Brussels' top budget official, Johannes Hahn, has said it could affect 70,000 companies in Europe with global turnover exceeding 750 million euros, his peer responsible for the single market, Thierry Breton, has urged caution on the matter.
National Association of German Cooperative Banks (BVR) said the Commission's debt should be repaid through savings elsewhere in the EU budget or with higher contributions from member states to their joint coffers.
""Under no circumstances should European solidarity in dealing with the corona crisis lead to Europe-wide and permanent additional tax burdens,"" it said.
Significantly deeper fiscal integration would also mark a step towards a more federalist EU, a notion that some members reject.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets marched to new three-month highs in early trade on Wednesday after what was arguably the first big positive surprise from U.S. economic data since the explosion of the Covid-19 pandemic in March.
Payrolls processor ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) reported that a net 2.76 million private-sector workers lost their jobs in the month to mid-May, that was much better than the 9 million number expected. The data arguably augur well for the official labor market report on Friday, although neither report is as up-to-date as the weekly jobless claims numbers that will be published on Thursday.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 253 points, or 1.0%, at 25,995, while the S&P 500 was up 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.5%.
The news encouraged those who have been shifting money back into cyclical and 'value' stocks since the first signs of a bottoming out began to emerge. Airline and banking stocks tended to outperform again, with Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock rising 4.0% and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock rising .4.8%, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 3.5% and Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) stock rose 5.0%.
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) stock surged another 3.9% to a new record high after the maker of videoconferencing software posted better-than-expected quarterly results after the closing bell on Thursday. The company's earnings per share of 20c were more than double expectations, while revenue rose 169% and the numbers of premium and paying subscribers both topped forecasts.
Among the losers was Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock, which fell 0.9% after the company took down various accounts linked to white supremacists and right-wing provocateurs masquerading as 'antifa' affiliates. The move came after internal pressure on CEO Mark Zuckerberg to moderate the site's content more proactively - a step that may bring it into conflict with an administration that has accused social media of left-wing bias in recent days.
Money also flowed out of various stocks that had been seen as either profiting from or immune to the effects of the pandemic.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock fell 0.2%, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 0.1% and streaming device maker  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock fell 1.8%.
In other markets, crude oil prices eased after hitting a new three-month high on hopes for an extended period of output restraint by major exporters. By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), U.S. crude futures were up 0.3% at $36.92 a barrel, amid reports that Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to extend the current deal by only one month instead of the three months that oil bulls had hoped for.

755,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",Some global firms consider moving treasury operations out of HK: sources,"By Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Some global companies are considering shifting some of their treasury operations out of Hong Kong as the United States moves to end the city's privileges, senior bankers said, in the latest blow to the territory's status as a major financial hub.
U.S. President Donald Trump has begun the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish Beijing's decision to impose new national security laws there - which China and Hong Kong say will not hurt rights and freedoms.
Against the backdrop, a handful of global firms are eyeing a move of some of their corporate treasury operations to countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, four senior bankers with knowledge of the matter said. 
""Companies' treasury operations follow trade flow and now there are many questions around Hong Kong's status as a trade hub,"" said a Hong Kong-based banker with a leading global trade finance bank.
Trade flows could be hit if the end of Hong Kong's special relationship with the United States sees the city's goods subject to the same - higher - rates paid by companies in mainland China, which has been fighting a trade war with the United States. Hong Kong's zero tariff rates on U.S. imports could also be at risk. 
""Some (multinational corporations) are considering shifting a part of their treasury operations (out of Hong Kong) to start with and then gradually scale it up,"" the banker said.
A leading U.S. retail chain, which operates hundreds of stores around Asia, is already in early talks with its banks to move some cash management related operations to Singapore from Hong Kong, the banker said.
The bankers, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, help companies set up the treasury centres and manage them. They are in talks with the companies about their likely relocation plans but said there was no strict timeline.
If it happens, the development would deal another blow to Hong Kong's status as a major financial hub, following widespread pro-democracy protests last year.
Already there are signs rich Chinese are seeking to park fewer funds in Hong Kong.
But the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city's de-facto central bank, told Reuters via e-mail that interests from corporates in setting up treasury operations in Hong Kong remained strong.
""There is no noticeable sign of fund outflow from either the Hong Kong dollar or banking system,"" it said.
SINGAPORE EDGE
The end of the preferential treatment could hurt Hong Kong's hard-fought progress in competing with Singapore for treasury operations centres - which manage risk, borrowing, lending and raise capital for companies - in Asia.
While Singapore has historically had the edge thanks to its low tax base and pro-business policies, Hong Kong recovered some ground in recent years as the HKMA unveiled sweeping tax measures in 2016.
Chinese and global companies favour Hong Kong to run their treasury operations and reroute enormous amounts of trade via the city lured by the presence of large trade finance banks, ease in capital flow and access to foreign exchange liquidity.
All of this could come under threat if the U.S. pulls the plug on Hong Kong's special relationship.
""These political moves will see global companies putting in place back-up plans for their critical treasury operations,"" said another banker with an European bank.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) is launching a $100 million fund to invest in ""companies led by founders and entrepreneurs of color"", in the latest corporate action as protests roil the United States.
Described as SoftBank's bid to improve diversity, ""we have to put money behind it, set plans, and hold ourselves accountable,"" SoftBank's Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure, who will head the fund, wrote in a letter to employees on Wednesday. 
Named the ""Opportunity Growth Fund"", its total initial size is less than a typical single investment by the $100 billion Vision Fund, which is headed by Claure's rival Rajeev Misra, and will focus on African Americans and Latinos in the U.S.. 
In addition to leading restructuring at floundering office space startup WeWork, Claure runs a fund investing in Latin America. He and Misra are seen as potential successors to Chief Executive Masayoshi Son. 
Claure wrote that Tokyo-headquartered SoftBank was also establishing a ""dedicated diversity and inclusion program"".
SoftBank's management is overwhelmingly male, with the company planning to nominate its first female board director at a shareholder meeting later this month. 
While spanning a wide range of nationalities, only four of 30 investors listed on Vision Fund's website are female. 
Companies including foreign firms like SoftBank have made public statements following the worst U.S. civil unrest in decades as the death of an unarmed black man reignites the issue of police brutality against African Americans.

Sony Corp (T:6758) this week pushed back an event for its upcoming PlayStation 5 console, saying ""we want to stand back and allow more important voices to be heard.""

761,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Brazil's rescue plan flaws imperil small business recovery,"By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Most of Brazil's small businesses, which account for more than half of its jobs and 30% of gross domestic product, are not getting the cash President Jair Bolsonaro pledged to help them through the coronavirus crisis, putting recovery at risk.
Despite a $7 billion program to help small and medium-sized businesses pay their workers as lockdowns tipped Brazil into its steepest annual downturn since records began, banks have so far only 5% distributed of the funds, Economy Ministry data shows. 
Jose Eutimio Brandao Jr, who fired 50 of the 170 people he employed at a bar, restaurant, bakery and nightclub in the northeastern state of Alagoas, is one of those affected.
Brandao wanted a loan to help pay his remaining staff, but says his bank turned him down because his group's total revenue surpasses a 10 million reais ($1.9 million) ceiling.
""(The) interest rate is low, equal to the then benchmark Selic, at 3.75% a year, the banks won't make money with it,"" Brandao told Reuters. 
A survey by small business industry group Sebrae found that some 86% of firms that sought loans had not received them, with 28% still awaiting an answer.
Meanwhile BNDES, Brazil's state development bank, is in talks to bail out airlines like Azul and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, jetmaker Embraer and even the local units of multinationals like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM).
And while some big corporate rescues have suffered problems, the small business program's limitations have reinforced a perception of inequality in Latin America's largest economy.
Brazilian banks extended 442 billion reais in new loans over the last two months, but almost 60% went to large corporations, Central Bank data on Brazil's total loan book shows. 
The Economy Ministry said in a statement to Reuters that it is working on alternative credit lines, and that it is already subsidizing the payroll loan program. 
OVERESTIMATED 
Many business owners, unsure about their future revenues and concerned they will be taking on debt that will be tough to repay, say they are reluctant to apply for the aid.
Unlike the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program, which forgives the loan if used to pay employees, the funds offered in Brazil are liabilities that would add to a company's debt.
So firms are firing staff or cutting salaries instead.
Luiz Soares, whose three hair salons and one restaurant saw sales decimated by Sao Paulo's stay at home orders, opted to pass on the payroll loan program and fired at least 10 of his 25 formally hired employees.
Soares, 68, who has another 100 people working for him as contractors, is now renegotiating existing bank loans, although he worries whether customers will show up at his mall-based restaurant and how many will be allowed in his salons.
""I can't get more credit, I have no idea of when I will be able to reopen and how much my revenue will be,"" Soares said.
Only 40% of the small businesses polled by Sebrae sought loans, although 90% say they lost revenue during the pandemic.
Even among those who did try to borrow, many said they struggled with the complexities of the program, which include having a bank manage payrolls and risk analysis by the banks, which include Itau Unibanco, Banco Bradesco and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil, administering the scheme. 
These banks must also provide 15% of each loan, which critics say has made them overly strict in considering applications because their own capital is at risk. 
""The reach of payroll credit has been overestimated, as most targeted companies do not comply with requirements,"" Cassio Schmidt, Santander Brasil's director of retail loans, said. 
Schmidt told Reuters the bank has been less strict for the payroll loan, but is still flagging obvious risks, such as borrowers more than 30 days in arrears on existing loans.
Itau and Bradesco did not comment.
LONG STRUGGLE 
But many businesses say banks are avoiding a program they view as risky and offering too little profit. 
""Banks do not want to run the risk, they know restaurants will struggle for a long time,"" said Paulo Solmucci, head of Brazil's restaurants association, which represents 6,000 businesses, saying most of them did not get loans. 
Some business owners told Reuters that since the loans are focused on payrolls only, they fall short of many of their needs, including rent and utility bills.
The program also requires companies to process their payrolls through one of Brazil's largest banks, giving small businesses, many of which electronically transfer funds to employees or pay cash, an added hurdle.
To broaden the program's reach, the government is considering changes such as allowing companies to fire up to 50% of their workforce and raising the revenue limit to 50 million reais, central bank chief Roberto Campos Neto said this week.
And in answer to complaints from some businesses that the payroll loans did not address other costs, it will start offering an all-purpose credit line.
But borrowers under that program, which is not yet operational, must start repaying the loans within a month, a tough ask for companies that have no idea of when they can resume activities, at least three businessmen told Reuters. 
And while the government has promised to make up for 85% of potential losses under that program, banks are responsible for the full amount of the initial loan, making them even more cautious, one executive told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.
Bolsonaro's economic team rolled out yet another program in late May for which small businesses will also be eligible, using funds from an existing state development bank fund.
But Carlos Chiaroni, who owns a music store in a Sao Paulo mall, wants the state to do more.

""If I had all the collateral banks are requesting, I would not need a loan right now. It shows that if the government doesn't provide credit, nobody will,"" he said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to continue to push higher Wednesday, as investors look past domestic civil unrest and take comfort from signs of more economic strength ahead.
At 7:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 12 points, or 0.4%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 31 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Futures contract rose 169 points, or 0.7%. 
All three cash indices are more than 30% above their first-quarter lows, with the DJIA at its highest level since March 6, the S&P 500 since March 4, and the Nasdaq Composite at its highest since Feb. 20.
Earlier Wednesday, data from the Chinese services sector showed this area of the second largest economy in the world growing at pre-pandemic levels, while there were also signs that the worst was over for euro-zone businesses.
These signs of economic growth returning, helped by a significant amount of fiscal stimulus, as the coronavirus pandemic passes its peak. That's overshadowing the continued civil unrest that has plagued many cities across America over the last few days.
Investors will now focus on ADP (NASDAQ:ADP)'s monthly employment report, a precursor to Friday’s official payrolls release, at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT).
This is expected to show another 9 million jobs lost in May, a horrific figure but an improvement from the last report which showed a loss of 20.2 million from payrolls, the most in the history of the report.
In corporate news,  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) rose 5% in premarket trading after the ride-hiring firm reporting a 26% jump in rides on its platform in May from the prior month, helped by strong growth in cities where coronavirus-induced restrictions have been eased.
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) rose 1.2% after the videoconferencing service reported a blockbuster quarter as the coronavirus pandemic fueled a boom in remote working and socializing.
Oil prices sold off Wednesday, consolidating after recent sharp gains amid doubts that the next meeting from OPEC and its allies will be able to agree a production policy for July as soon as this week, due to suspicions that some countries are already producing above their quota.
The U.S. releases official crude inventory data at 10:30 AM ET. The American Petroleum Institute’s data on Tuesday indicated a slight draw in stocks last week.

Ashwani Gupta, the Japanese company's global chief operating head, told the BBC its commitment to the car plant, the UK's largest, could not be maintained if there was not tariff-free access to the bloc.
The EU is the biggest market for the factory, which made just under 350,000 vehicles last year and builds the Qashqai, Juke and Leaf models.
""You know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue. We are committed. Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it's not our intention but the business will not be sustainable. That's what everybody has to understand,"" Gupta told the BBC.
The UK left the EU on Jan. 31 but the main terms of its membership remain in place during a transition period until the end of this year, allowing it time to negotiate a new free trade deal with the bloc. However, the talks are at an impasse. 
Last week Nissan said it would close its plant in Barcelona, Spain, from December as part of global cost cuts. The facility is its main car factory in Spain and employs 3,000.

Gupta also told the BBC that any plans for its strategic partner and 43% shareholder  Renault  (PA:RENA) to take up spare capacity at the Sunderland plant would be a matter for the French carmaker.

765,By Investing.com,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Brexit Clouds Gather Again - and Markets Are Ignoring Them,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- One of the few redeeming features of the pandemic was arguably that it allowed the U.K. and – to a far smaller degree - the rest of Europe to stop talking about Brexit for a while.
Those happy times are over. Sky News reported earlier that the Bank of England’s new Governor Andrew Bailey has warned British banks to step up their preparations for a ‘hard Brexit’ at the end of the year, when the current standstill transition period ends.
Meanwhile, the global chief operating officer of Nissan (OTC:NSANY), which spared its U.K. factory in last week’s radical restructuring exercise, is again warning that it will have to rethink the operation’s future if the two sides can’t agree tariff-free access to each other’s markets.
The U.K. and EU have until the end of June to decide whether or not they want to extend a transition arrangement that has created a “phony peace” in U.K. asset markets, allowing business with the EU to continue for another few months as if the country hadn’t actually left the bloc at the end of January.
The U.K., in particular, has shown no sign of wanting to extend this transition, meaning that the sudden loss of access to European markets for U.K. companies – and vice versa – remains a very real risk at the end of 2020.
There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, the new government, having promised a liberation from the tyranny of Brussels, cannot afford to stay bound by the EU’s top court, as it currently is. Secondly, it calculates that the EU will be even less willing than usual to risk another short-term hit to its economy by imposing a “hard” Brexit, due to the immense challenges that the pandemic has created.
In truth, neither economy can really afford the luxury of further self-imposed hardship: Covid-1 has not been conquered in the U.K., despite the government’s relaxation of lockdown measures; business surveys released on Wednesday showed purchasing manager indices still barely above 30, well below the 50 level that usually signifies growth;  and job losses are accelerating, as companies across the region come to the conclusion that even generous wage subsidy schemes aren’t enough to persuade them to keep workers on the payroll. Germany’s jobless rolls rose by 238,000 in May, well above the 200,000 rise expected.
(Markets didn’t care much about the data, pushing the Stoxx 600 up another 1.5% and the FTSE 100 up 1.4% in an increasingly desperate move by institutional investors to capture the rebound in beaten-down cyclical stocks).
Such pressures should – should ­– ensure that a worst-case outcome is avoided by a typically European compromise, which would justify the markets' current lack of concern. However, the first rule of Brexit has, from the outset, been that economically rational outcomes are not guaranteed, and that the risks need to be priced in accordingly.  That is being lost in a short-term scramble for performance. "

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese advertising giant Dentsu Group Inc (T:4324) has received almost $700 million via a government contract to provide back-office services for a scheme to help virus-hit firms, under a framework opposition lawmakers called ""opaque"".
Dentsu received 97% of the 76.9 billion yen ($707 million) awarded via a tender to a company it co-founded to support the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry's relief fund for small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs), showed a government document seen by Reuters.
Opposition politicians have questioned whether the contract with Service Design Engineering Council - and its arrangement with Dentsu and its multitude of subcontractors - is a waste of taxpayers' money and could slow the process of channelling funds to eligible recipients.
Dentsu, echoing a statement from Service Design Engineering Council, told Reuters it was performing duties in line with government guidelines and had operations in place to help disburse the funds as swiftly as possible.
Scrutiny of the use of private companies to run the relief scheme comes as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's support rate has slid, partly due to his handling of the pandemic which critics have called clumsy.
Japan is emerging from government restrictions on movement and business aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus, having recorded 17,000 cases of COVID-19 - the respiratory illness caused by the virus - and over 900 deaths.
Like the SMEs targeted by the relief fund, Dentsu has also been impacted by the lockdown measures. Particularly painful for the firm was the virus-induced delay in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, in which it has a central part.
Dentsu plays an outsized role in Japan beyond its dominance of the advertising industry, including providing services to the government.
It established Service Design Engineering Council in 2016 with staffing firm  Pasona Group Inc  (T:2168) and IT firm Transcosmos Inc.
Dentsu is subcontracting some work from the latest contract to Pasona and Transcosmos, the government document showed.
Pasona and Transcosmos did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares hit three-month highs on Wednesday and the dollar fell for the sixth day running as easing lockdowns and hopes for more monetary stimulus gave investors confidence, despite civil unrest in the United States and rising COVID-19 tolls.
The MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) world equity index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, rose to its highest since March 6, having gained throughout the Asian session.
The index is down more than 7% year-to-date, amid pandemic lockdowns that have pushed many economies into contraction.
MSCI's main European Index also held near three-month highs and European bourses opened higher, with the STOXX 600 up over 1% and back to levels not seen since March 6.
In China, Japan and South Korea, where COVID-19 is relatively contained, stock indexes have recovered substantially to be only about 5-6% below this year's peaks.
There are some signs of recovery in business activity as governments restart their economies, albeit in the knowledge that easing lockdowns too early could trigger a second wave of COVID-19. 
A closely-watched survey of service sector activity in China recovered to pre-epidemic levels in May.
Broader economic optimism supported risk-sensitive currencies and pushed down the dollar, which hit a three-month low against a basket of comparable currencies at around 0730 GMT.
""In a scenario where there's no meaningful recurrence of the virus, and progress is made on treatments and vaccines, we expect the U.S. dollar's weakness to continue,"" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.
Oil rose on Wednesday, with Brent above $40 for the first time since March, as optimism mounted that major producers will extend output cuts and a recovery from the pandemic will spur demand for fuel.
Brent crude futures for August were up around 1.8% at $40.27 a barrel, by 0730 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained $0.92, or 2.5%, to $37.73 a barrel, the highest since March 6.
Spot gold fell 0.5% to around $1,717 per ounce.
STEEPENING U.S. YIELD CURVE
Germany's ten-year government bond yield rose to its highest since mid-April as the global risk-on mood saw demand for safer debt decline, slipping back slightly to -0.386% by 0825 GMT. 
The European Central Bank is expected to ramp up stimulative bond purchases when it meets on Thursday.
The euro, which rose above $1.12 for the first time in 11 weeks in early London trading, is on track for a seven-day winning streak against the dollar - its longest streak since December 2013.
The safe-haven Japanese yen hit a two-month low of 108.85 to the dollar before bouncing back to around 108.79 per dollar.
The U.S. Treasury yield curve steepened, partly reflecting the sale of more government debt to finance massive stimulus efforts. 
The 30-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose to as high as 1.532%, its highest since mid-March, as expectations of central bank policy support kept shorter yields in check.
The yield gap between five- and 30-year Treasuries rose to 118 basis points, the highest since early 2017.
Tens of thousands of people defied U.S. curfews to take to the streets on Tuesday for an eighth night of protests over the death of a black man in police custody.

UOKiK said in 2018 it charged six companies, including one owned by Gazprom, with financing construction of the pipeline without a legally required permit. It said that in early 2020 Gazprom failed to provide documents relating to the case.
""Gazprom cannot operate above the law and, for that reason, I have initiated proceedings against the company to impose a fine for failure to provide information during the pending investigation,"" UOKiK President Tomasz Chrostny said in a statement.
Poland sees Nord Stream 2, which would double Russia's gas export capacity via the Baltic Sea, as a threat to Europe's energy security, saying it will strengthen Gazprom's already dominant position on the market.
Nord Stream 2 is led by Gazprom, with half of the funding provided by Germany’s Uniper (DE:UN01) and BASF's (DE:BASFn) Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell (L:RDSa), Austria's OMV (VI:OMVV) and Engie (PA:ENGIE).
In 2019 UOKiK fined Engie 40 million euros for failing to provide documents and information relating to the case.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) is considering having fewer staff work at its Tokyo headquarters permanently now that the coronavirus pandemic has spurred a huge shift to remote working, its chief executive said.
Around 80% of staff at Nomura's headquarters in the financial district of Otemachi have been working from home due to the outbreak.
""Do we need such a lot of staff in Otemachi? Do we need that much workspace here? I would like to discuss those issues,"" Kentaro Okuda told Reuters in an interview, adding that the company would conduct a review of the matter.
Japan's biggest investment bank and brokerage occupies most floors of the 22-storey Otemachi building, but it declined to specify how many people it employs there or what size of reduction in staff working at the offices it was looking at.
Firms across the world are looking at changing their work-from-office cultures with tech firms leading the way.  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) said last month it will permanently embrace remote work even after coronavirus lockdowns ease and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) has also said some employees can work from home indefinitely.
Reduced rent could help Nomura which has struggled to expand successfully overseas and been hit by competition from online stock-trading rivals. It has announced three major rounds of cost cuts since 2011, including one last year when it said it was seeking to reduce costs by 140 billion yen ($1.3 billion) by March 2022.
Okuda also said he is looking at scaling back Nomura's retail branches in the wake of the pandemic without providing details. Nomura has 128 retail branches in Japan.
The interview was conducted last week and embargoed for release on Wednesday.

Dublin-based SMBC, which has 133 of the aircraft on order, did not provide further details of its new delivery schedule. 
Boeing's best-selling plane was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes which killed 346 people. 
While the jetmaker resumed production of the MAX last week, a number of orders have been cancelled or deferred in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Aircraft leasing firms, which together control over 40% of the global passenger fleet, are among the largest customers of the MAX and several have cancelled or deferred orders since the start of the pandemic. 
Aercap, the world's largest lessor, last month said it had obtained the deferral of deliveries of dozens of MAX jets and said it could cancel some orders. 
Leasing firm Avolon in April announced the cancellation of 75 MAX jets that were due to be delivered by 2023.
SMBC said in its annual results that it was well positioned to weather the disruption to global air travel caused by the pandemic.
The firm, which is owned by a consortium including Japan's Sumitomo Corp (T:8053) and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group (T:8316), said it has $10.6 billion in support from its shareholders. 
That includes $2.9 billion of equity and $7.7 billion debt financing of which $3.2 billion was undrawn as at March 31, it said. It said it had $6.3 billion of available liquidity at the end of March. 
The firm reported a record profit before tax of $364.5 million for the year to March 31, up almost 5.8%.

Investing.com - European stock markets posted strong gains Wednesday, helped by signs of a global economic recovery as well as hopes for more stimulus.
At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.7% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 1.6%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 1.1%. 
Markets were supported by signs of life in the economy as service sector data around the continent came in better than expected, albeit they remained at historically low levels. The  German unemployment  rate also rose to 6.3% in May, from 5.8% in April. Joblessness is often seen as a lagging indicator but has caused acute concern about the permanent loss of productive capacity and the vigor of the economic rebound in the current circumstances.
Earlier Wednesday, a closely-watched survey of China’s service sector activity showed activity recovering to pre-epidemic levels in May. This was positive news from the second-largest economy in the world, but is yet to be validated by hard data: so far, retail sales have lagged far behind the bounce in industrial production in China.
Additionally, the European Central Bank is also expected to ramp up stimulative bond purchases when it meets on Thursday, which would bridge the gap until the European Commission's proposed 750 billion euro ($830 billion) recovery plan can become reality.
In corporate news,  Renault  (PA:RENA) jumped almost 8% after it finalized a 5 billion euro ($5.60 billion) loan from the French government as the carmaker struggled with the impact from the coronavirus shutdown.
AXA (PA:AXAF) soared over 6% after it only cut its dividend for 2019 by half, while adding that it could propose an additional fourth-quarter shareholder payment if conditions improved. Many other big dividend payers, especially in the financial sector, have suspended their payments either voluntarily or under pressure from regulators.
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) gained 2.5% despite posting a hefty net loss of 2.1 billion euros ($2.35 billion) in the first quarter due to the pandemic. The German airline agreed last week to a 9 billion euro rescue package from the state.
Oil prices posted more gains Wednesday, climbing to near three-month highs amid optimism that major producers will extend production cuts later this week.
Helping the positive tone was the American Petroleum Institute reporting late Tuesday that U.S. oil supplies fell by 483,000 barrels for the week ended May 29.
At 4:05 AM ET, U.S. crude oil futures traded 2.4% higher at $37.70 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.8% to $40.28. These contracts have both climbed to the highest levels since March 6.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,723.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1216, up 0.4%, near its highest in nearly three months.

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 1%, hovering near three-month highs, led by gains in insurers (SXIP), automakers (SXAP), banks (SX7P) and oil & gas (SXEP) sectors. 
A survey showed China's services sector returned to growth in May for the first time since January, even though employment and overseas demand remained weak.
Final data on euro zone business activity for May is due at 0800 GMT.
Massive stimulus from major central banks, hopes of a COVID-19 vaccine and improving economic data have helped the STOXX 600 recover about 35% from March lows, leaving it a little over 16% below February highs. 
Among individual stocks,  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) jumped 7.6% after it finalised a 5 billion euro ($5.60 billion) loan from with the French government and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) upgraded its stock to ""buy"".
French insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) rose 6.1% after revealing plans to halve its dividend amid the coronavirus crisis, but said it could propose an additional fourth-quarter shareholder payment if conditions improved.
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) gained 1.7% as it vowed to step up restructuring measures after posting a first-quarter net loss of 2.1 billion euros ($2.35 billion).

French luxury goods group LVMH (PA:LVMH) edged up 0.4% after fashion trade publication WWD reported that its $16.2 billion takeover of  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF) is looking less certain.

Polestar, which currently has only one showroom in Beijing, plans to have 20 in 17 Chinese cities, the automaker said in a statement on Wednesday. The Gothenburg, Sweden-based company is manufacturing cars in China's eastern city of Taizhou.
Showroom strength is becoming an important differentiator for electric vehicle (EV) makers in the world's biggest auto and EV market, as they line up model launches.
The automaker plans to export Polestar 2 sedans to Europe and the United States, and will open showrooms first in Shanghai and then expand to coastal Ningbo and southern Guangzhou. The showrooms will be mostly in shopping malls.

The Germany-based company (DE:TUIGn) said in a statement on Wednesday that Boeing would provide it with compensation for a significant portion of the financial impact of the grounding of the plane, which had hit its earnings over the last year. 
Boeing will also provide it with credits for future orders and agreed that TUI will get fewer 737 MAX aircraft over the next few years with deliveries delayed by about two years, reducing TUI's expenditure at a time when cash is tight. 
Details of the agreement were confidential, said TUI. 
TUI said in May it needed to cut 8,000 jobs and shed 30% of its costs after coronavirus halted holidays, bringing its business to a standstill.
The company said the agreement with Boeing would help it shrink its airline businesses over the coming years, something it wants to do amid forecasts that the travel market will take several years to recover from the pandemic.

MELBOURNE/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Philippine conglomerate Ayala Corp has made a bid worth A$777 million ($535 million) to buy Infigen Energy, pouncing on the Australian renewables company at a time when wind and solar firms are battling falling power prices.
UAC Energy Holdings, a joint venture of Ayala's AC Energy and Hong Kong-based UPC Renewables Group, said it would offer A$0.80 a share in cash, a 36% premium to Infigen's previous close.
Infigen's shares soared to a four-month high of A$0.81 after the bid was announced, reflecting investors' view a deal could go ahead.
""We think this takeover offer allows shareholders to crystallise value now at an attractive premium to the recent share price,"" Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) analyst James Nevin said in a note.
Sydney-based Infigen did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
If successful, UAC would acquire seven wind farms and a 600-megawatt pipeline of projects which Infigen recently deferred to save money amid falling wholesale power prices, COVID-19 restrictions, and challenges integrating wind and solar farms into Australia's shaky grid.
""We have ready access to capital and significant renewable energy expertise that will position us well to support Infigen’s pipeline of projects and focus on much needed renewable energy investment and associated employment in Australia,"" UAC Chairman Anton Rohner said in a statement.
UAC is developing four other renewables projects in Australia.
RBC's Nevin said it would make sense for shareholders to accept the offer, given Infigen has put its growth ambitions on hold, which would likely cap its share price growth in the near term.
UAC has already acquired a 12.8% stake in Infigen.
It has set no minimum acceptance condition for the bid, so it would not need support from Infigen's top shareholder, UK activist investor TCI Fund Management, which owns 26% of Infigen, according to Refinitiv data. 
TCI partners in London were not immediately available to comment outside office hours.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 10:37PM ET</span>","Big in China and tiny in the U.S., Fast Retailing seen weathering pandemic","By Ritsuko Ando and Sophie Yu
TOKYO/BEIJING (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic is shredding the global apparel industry, stripping hundreds of billions of dollars from sales and thrusting big names like J.Crew into bankruptcy protection.
While no major fashion firms have been spared, Japan's Fast Retailing (T:9983), owner of the Uniqlo brand and not far behind the world's No. 2 H&M (ST:HMb) in sales, looks well placed to cope with the crisis better than rivals.
That's thanks to legions of faithful Chinese fans like 25-year-old IT worker Niu Ran, whose wardrobe is crammed with Uniqlo basics like shirts and socks and was looking for more in a post-lockdown shopping trip.
""I like Uniqlo because it's very easy to match and the quality is not bad,"" he said, waiting in line to try on pants at a Uniqlo store in Wangfujing, Beijing's prime shopping district.
""It satisfies all my needs, so I don't need to spend time elsewhere."" 
Led by Tadashi Yanai, Japan's richest man, Fast Retailing has expanded aggressively in China with 750 Uniqlo stores, roughly the same number in its home market.
Mainland China has all but contained domestic transmission of the coronavirus with lockdowns lifted in most areas since March and the world’s no. 2 economy is widely expected to emerge from pandemic-induced pain faster than other countries.
In other parts of Asia too, key markets such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have been more successful than the West in curbing the virus.
In contrast, rivals mostly focused on the U.S. market like Gap Inc (N:GPS) or far more dependent on Europe like Zara-owner and industry leader  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H&M, are expected to face a longer downturn.
""Asia is going to be much faster to bounce back in terms of willingness to spend, which will favour operators with a big presence in Asia,"" said Honor Strachan, retail analyst at research firm GlobalData.
""In the mature western markets across Europe, the U.S. and Canada, we expect the recovery to be long and drawn out,"" she said. 
GlobalData predicts the global apparel market will lose $297 billion in revenue this year due to the pandemic, with the United States accounting for 42% of that lost spending.
Of Uniqlo's 2,260 stores globally, just 51 are in the United States. Its inability to make strides in the world's biggest clothing market has long been seen as an Achilles heel, but for the time being it may prove a blessing.
Asia, however, accounts for three-quarters of Uniqlo's annual revenue and Greater China alone represents 20%.
While Strachan notes H&M and Inditex are some of the most resilient players in the market, Asia & Oceania make up just 15% of H&M's annual revenue while at Zara, its ""Asia and the rest of the world"" category accounts for 23% of sales.
THE BASICS ADVANTAGE
Uniqlo's long shelf-life items like Oxford shirts for work, chinos and underwear as well as its reputation for value for money are likely to resonate with consumers grappling with lost income or less job security more than the trend-based clothing of Zara and H&M, according to analysts.
""The quality is good and designs are classic,"" said Jiang Xin, an internet company employee in Beijing, one of many Chinese shoppers interviewed by Reuters who said they felt Uniqlo quality was a cut above comparably priced brands.
Although Fast Retailing warned in April operating profit could slide 44% in the year to end-August, analysts expect a quick recovery assuming key markets are not hit by a large second wave of infections. With a large proportion of items no-frills basics, it is hoping to limit discounts.
""We will be looking to gradually sell off the excess stock to normalise inventory over the next 18 months,"" CFO Takeshi Okazaki said on a call with analysts in April.
Fast Retailing declined to comment further on its business outlook for this article.
Rapid growth has brought Fast Retailing almost neck and neck with H&M. Last year the Japanese firm was more profitable with net income of around $1.5 billion compared to the Swedish chain's $1.4 billion, though its $21 billion in revenue was some $3 billion less.
And while it still has a way to go before it matches Inditex's annual sales of $31 billion, Yanai's long-held goal of making Fast Retailing the world's biggest retailer has looked less far-fetched in recent years.
But for that to happen, Uniqlo will have gain market share in the United States, analysts say, adding that it may have to offer more stylish items to get there.

""They still need to find a way to compete in the U.S.,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Allen. ""The current crisis doesn't change the equation for that.""

Royal Dutch Shell Plc (L:RDSa),  BP  Plc (L:BP),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM),  Hess Corp  (N:HES) and Murphy Oil (N:MUR) were taking precautions, but not evacuating workers from offshore production platforms on Tuesday because of Tropical Storm Cristobal. 
Cristobal formed Tuesday afternoon and was circulating in the Bay of Campeche off the coast of Mexico. 
The U.S. National Hurricane Center forecasts the storm will cross the Gulf of Mexico to make landfall on the Louisiana coast by early next week. 
Before making landfall, Cristobal will cross the major offshore oil and natural gas production areas in the Gulf. 
The Gulf of Mexico is home to 19% of U.S. crude output and 6% of dry natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

786,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 09:18PM ET</span>",Facebook Invests in Indonesia’s Gojek in WhatsApp Push,"(Bloomberg) --  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). is investing in Gojek, Indonesia’s ride-hailing and food delivery giant, as part of the social media company’s effort to expand into emerging markets and find partners for its WhatsApp messaging service.
It’s the second international investment Facebook has made in the past six weeks with a goal of getting more local businesses online. The company took about a 10% stake in India’s Reliance Jio for $5.7 billion in April. Facebook has plans to build a commerce business around WhatsApp, and is creating a payments feature for the app. It already lets businesses use WhatsApp as a mobile website to interact with customers.
“We believe WhatsApp in particular can be instrumental in creating a more digital Indonesia by bringing more people into one of the fastest growing digital economies in the world,” Facebook said in a blog post. The company didn’t specify how much it is investing and a spokesperson declined to share details.
Facebook’s backing is a boost for Indonesia’s largest startup, a ride-hailing giant that in recent years became a major provider of internet services from payments to meal delivery. Gojek, which is competing fiercely against Singapore’s Grab across the region, last closed a $1.2 billion funding round at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in March.
Gojek and Grab now aim to become Southeast Asian consumers’ default, all-purpose app, similar to Tencent’s WeChat. The Indonesian startup, whose backers include Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and Temasek Holdings Pte, has said it will deploy fresh capital to keep expanding despite global economic turbulence. The company, which debuted an app for hailing motorbike taxis in Jakarta in 2015, now also offers a score of other on-demand services such as house cleaning and medicine delivery, and was last valued at $10 billion according to CB Insights.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>",U.S. FAA chief to testify at Senate hearing on Boeing 737 MAX,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Aviation Administration chief Steve Dickson will testify June 17 before a U.S. Senate panel on certification of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX that was involved in two fatal crashes in five months that killed 346 people.
The Senate Commerce Committee said Dickson ""will testify about issues associated with the design, development, certification, and operation"" of the MAX that has been grounded since March 2019.
The FAA's long-standing practice of delegating certification tasks to Boeing employees for the MAX has come under withering criticism. Reuters has reported the FAA is not expected to grant approval to allow the MAX to resume flights until August at the earliest.
A House Transportation Committee in March called the FAA’s certification review of the 737 MAX ""grossly insufficient"" and said the agency had failed in its duty to identify key safety problems.
The U.S. Transportation Department's inspector general is expected to soon release a fact-finding report into the plane's certification, but make no recommendations. 
Boeing, which resumed production of the MAX last week at a very low rate, did not comment.
Senate Commerce chairman Roger Wicker introduced legislation Tuesday to require FAA to review assumptions regarding pilot reaction time and reform its certification processes to ""eliminate instances of undue pressure or 'regulatory coziness' that could lead to lapses in safety protocols.""
In January, Boeing released hundreds of internal messages containing harshly critical comments about MAX's development. One said the plane was “designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.""
The messages showed attempts to duck regulatory scrutiny with employees disparaging the plane, the company and FAA.
The U.S. Justice Department has been conducting a criminal investigation into the 737 MAX.
The FAA said last month it would require Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers to adopt new safety-management tools.

(Reuters) -  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) nearly doubled its expectations for annual sales on Tuesday, driven by a surge in users as more people work from home and connect with friends online during coronavirus lockdowns.
But Zoom's costs also rose sharply, and executives said gross margins would likely remain below Zoom's historical norms in the coming quarters, sending shares of the San Jose, California-based down 3.5% to $200.75 in after-market trading.
The company has transformed itself into a global video hangout from a business-oriented teleconferencing tool. It came under fire over privacy and security issues, prompting it to roll out major upgrades.
The company raised its full-year revenue forecast to a range of $1.78 billion to $1.80 billion from $905 million to $915 million. Analysts on average expected revenue of $935.2 million for the fiscal year ending January 2021.
The latest quarterly report shows the company now has about 265,400 customers with more than 10 employees, a near fourfold increase from a year earlier.
But there were also possible signs the Zoom boom may be slowing as economies reopen. Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg said the April peak usage of 300 million daily meeting participants declined slightly in May.
The company expects it to rise eventually above 300 million again.
Zoom company competes with Cisco Systems Inc's (O:CSCO) Webex,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) Teams and Google's (O:GOOGL) Meet platform for paying customers, particularly enterprises, while offering a free version to consumers.
Zoom reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $328.2 million, beating analysts' estimates of $202.7 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
While Zoom's revenue increased sharply, its costs rose even more steeply. The company's cost of revenue was up 330% to $103.7 million, which lowered its gross margin to 68.4% from 80.2% a year earlier. 
One of Zoom's biggest costs is data centers and bandwidth to host calls. The company runs some of its own data centers, but also pays for cloud computing services from Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft, and in April added  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) as a vendor.
On a Zoom call with investors, Chief Executive Eric Yuan said Amazon provided the ""majority"" of new capacity that Zoom needed to meet demand. 
Steckelberg said on the call that the company planned to expand its own data centers to become more efficient, which should boost margins to the mid-70% range in the next several quarters. Analysts had expected gross margins to hover between 79% and 81% over the coming year, according to Refinitiv data.
Excluding items, the company earned 20 cents per share in the latest quarter, beating analysts' estimate of 9 cents.

Zoom's shares have more than tripled this year.

The country reported 1,262 new deaths on Tuesday, bringing the number of fatalities to 31,199. There were also 28,936 new reported cases, pushing the country’s total to 555,383, behind only the U.S.
The nation of 210 million people has become an epicenter of the virus in the last few weeks. Brazil’s peak has not yet arrived, and “at the moment it is not possible to predict when it will arrive,” Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization’s Emergencies Program, said Monday.
The government of President Jair Bolsonaro has resisted social distancing efforts throughout the pandemic, with Bolsonaro often mingling with supporters and pushing for people to get back to work to ease the economic fallout of the crisis. Contradicting orders from municipal, state and federal leaders have sabotaged the country’s ability to fight the virus, which has now migrated from wealthier regions to more vulnerable regions -- such as the poor Northeast, favelas, and indigenous territories in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- where public health systems are precarious to begin with.

After about two months of loosely enforced quarantines, some regions of the country have begun to reopen from lockdowns. The state of Sao Paulo, the country’s richest, has instituted a color-coded system which allows some regions to open businesses already.
On Tuesday, the state reported almost 7,000 new infections and 327 deaths in the last 24 hours, both record numbers. The state, which accounts for about a third of Brazil’s economy, has been the epicenter of the disease in the country, with more than 118,000 cases and almost 8,000 fatalities.
With winter approaching the Southern Hemisphere, the country is entering a period of increased cases of respiratory diseases, further adding to concern that the peak may still be weeks away. The Health Ministry said last week that the curve of cases was still growing, and a report by UBS published Wednesday said that six of Brazil’s 27 states are peaking, while total deaths are increasing in 21 states.

790,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 06:05PM ET</span>",Rental fleet collapse drags down U.S. vehicle sales,"By Rachit Vats
(Reuters) - The collapse in demand for new vehicles from U.S. rental car fleets hit automakers hard in May, even as consumer sales were stronger than expected as coronavirus stay-at-home orders began to ease.
The collapse of air travel has pushed big car rental companies to cancel orders for new vehicles, punching a hole in sales for nearly a dozen U.S. automakers' including the Big Three in Detroit.
 Hyundai Motor  Co's (KS:005380) U.S. sales arm said Tuesday that its sales to fleets, including rental companies, fell by 79% in May, while retail sales grew by 5%.
Automakers could lose up to 12% of their annual U.S. vehicle sales in 2020 as car rental companies slammed by the coronavirus pandemic slash fleets and restructure, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
The retreat by rental car companies threatens production and jobs at U.S. factories that build vehicles popular with rental car fleets such as  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (N:HTZ), which filed for bankruptcy protection late last month.
Hertz has said it negotiated with U.S. manufacturers to cancel about 90% of its remaining 2020 fleet orders and has no plans to purchase new rental vehicles for the U.S. fleet. Likewise, Avis said it disposed of 35,000 cars in May and canceled 80% of its incoming rental vehicle orders in the U.S. for the rest of the year.

""At least 80% of new purchases stand canceled post COVID-19,"" said Hamzah Mazari, a Jefferies analyst. He predicts corporate travel won't recover until 2022 ""at the earliest.""
In 2019 alone, listed rental companies Hertz and rival  Avis Budget  Group Inc (O:CAR) together purchased about 970,000 vehicles, from about a dozen automakers, down about 2.4% from a year ago, according to Jefferies.
The global pandemic hit rental fleet sales hard in April, pushing them down 77%, or about 108,000 vehicles, according to Cox Automotive. Retail sales were off 41%, or just over 400,000 units. For May, the consultancy expects sales to be down about 33% versus May 2019.

IHS, which closely tracks automotive sales and production trends, said it expects global light vehicle sales to fall 22% to 70.3 million units in 2020, from prior estimates of a more than 12% drop.

Lyft's shares rose 4.2% to $33.02 in extended trading after the company said rides had risen week-over-week for seven consecutive weeks since the week ended April 12. 
""For the last three weekends, as restrictions on certain activities were eased in parts of the country, there was stronger relative sequential growth in weekend rides versus weekly rides on Lyft's rideshare platform,"" the company said.
However, the company said rides were down about 70% in May from a year ago.
Ridesharing companies have struggled with slow demand as millions of people around the world stayed at home due to government mandates imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Lyft expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) loss for the second quarter to not exceed $325 million if average daily volumes in June remain unchanged from May levels.

San Francisco, California-based Lyft had previously forecast second-quarter EBITDA loss to be below $360 million.

Investing.com -- Wall Street gained momentum Tuesday, with U.S. stock indexes rising on renewed hopes for the economic recovery despite ongoing civil unrest.
Stocks in the financial, industrial and energy sectors led the major indexes higher throughout Tuesday's trading session. Energy stocks jumped on hopes that oil producing nations would agree to extend production cuts, which has lifted the price of oil in recent days after a sharp downturn.
Data on payroll and factory orders will be released Wednesday, along with a spate of earnings, including a report from  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB).
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Payroll Numbers Expected to Drop Another 20 Million
ADP's (NASDAQ:ADP) monthly National Employment Report, often a harbinger of government data that gets released later in the week, is expected to show another 9 million jobs lost in the period. Those numbers arrive at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT).
The last report on May 6 showed a loss of 20.2 million from payrolls, the most in the history of the report.
Any improvement, however slight, may be interpreted as a positive sign that the U.S. economy was emerging from the worst of its downturn, after companies were forced to close down and people ordered to remain home to slow the spread of the deadly Covid-19 virus.
Since the middle of May, various states and cities have gradually loosened restrictions, allowing businesses and consumers to move gradually back to normal, though hiring and business activity may not reflect a strengthening economy for a few more months.
2. Factory Orders Expected to Improve
Another barometer of economic activity are the monthly factory orders, which are due out in the morning. The forecast is for a decline in new orders for U.S. manufacturing goods by 14% in April.
That would be larger than the 10.4% decline reported May 4 for the month of March, when the coronavirus pandemic disrupted supply chains and consumer activity.
3. Earnings Reports Test Strength of Food Makers During Pandemic
Campbell Soup is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter earnings before the market open on Wednesday. The condensed soup maker has been trying to segue into higher growth food categories like snacks and organic products, and it may get a boost from people preparing their own meals during stay-at-home mandates over the last few months.
Analysts forecast profit of 72 cents a share on sales of $2.2 billion. Shares of the $15.6 billion company have risen 6% this year, closing Tuesday at $52.01.

Tiffany's shares closed down nearly 9% after the news. 
LVMH's board called a meeting in Paris on Tuesday night to discuss the matter, WWD reported, citing sources. 
LVMH's board is concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic and protests linked to the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, according to the report.
The French company's board also voiced concerns about Tiffany's ability to cover all its debt covenants at the end of the transaction, which was expected to be concluded mid-year, WWD reported. 
Tiffany did not immediately respond to a request for comment and LVMH declined to comment.
Louis Vuitton owner LVMH agreed in November to buy Tiffany for $16.2 billion in its biggest acquisition yet. The $135 per-share cash deal would likely boost LVMH's smallest business, the jewelry and watch division that is already home to Bulgari and Tag Heuer, help it expand in one of the fastest-growing industry sections and broaden its U.S. presence.
That said, New York-based Tiffany, founded in 1837 and known for its signature robin's egg blue boxes, was already in turnaround mode as it tries to rejuvenate its image and attract shoppers online.

It will have further challenges to overcome as spending patterns shift and international tourism continues to nosedive due to trade tensions between Beijing and Washington and the novel coronavirus outbreak, which forced nonessential retailers to shutter stores globally.

Barra said those permanent cost reductions could included few different vehicle platforms offered by the No. 1 U.S automaker and reducing the complexity of those platforms to be more focused on producing the versions consumers want most.
She said that the pandemic had given GM the opportunity to go through all of its line item expenses and eliminate redundant processes. 
""We've found things that we don't need to do and things we can do more efficiently,"" Barra said.
The U.S. automotive industry has been ramping up after the coronavirus shutdown, and major automakers have been keeping a close eye on suppliers in Mexico to see the pandemic disrupts the flow of parts. 

Barra said on Tuesday if there are problems in GM's supply chain, the automaker will focus on diverting parts for its popular, highly-profitable pickup trucks.

800,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Record $666 Billion China Local-Debt Wave Sees Foreigners Wary,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s success in luring foreigners into its domestic debt market, the world’s second largest, faces a new test in coming months as officials try to drum up interest in a record wave of bonds from local authorities.
International funds now hold 8.6% of China’s central government bonds, several times more than the share just several years ago, and not terribly far from the 13% overseas stake in Japanese sovereigns. Inflows continued through the coronavirus crisis, and the U.S. trade war.
Officials are hoping that interest might extend to local government notes, where foreign ownership is merely 0.01%. Issuance will climb to 4.73 trillion yuan ($666 billion) this year to help bolster economic growth that is expected to be the worst since the 1970s.
“As China’s local government bond market is expanding quickly, regulators need to attract more diversified investors, including foreigners,” said Zhou Guannan, an analyst with Huachuang Securities Co. in Beijing. She said that would help “alleviate pressure on banks” -- which are usually dominant buyers, but are now burdened by mounting bad loans and requests to keep credit flowing to businesses.
Problem is, that legacy of bank purchases has left the local government bond market even less readily tradable than for central government bonds. That’s because the banks typically buy and hold -- making it more costly to exit a position should a foreign investor need.
Plus, yields on these bonds generally don’t offer a premium over debt from so-called policy-banks -- lenders owned by the central government that often carry out Beijing’s policy objectives. Given such disadvantages, overseas investors have a negligible share of the 21 trillion yuan of local government debt outstanding as of the end of 2019, more than a fifth of the entire domestic market.
Trading in the local bonds was just 5.3 trillion yuan in the first five months of the year, slightly more than a quarter of that in sovereign notes, where the total supply outstanding is 30% less.
“We don’t buy local government bonds,” said Edmund Goh, Asia fixed-income investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Shanghai. “The spread between local government bond and central government bond is too narrow, and the liquidity is bad.”
Chinese regulators are aware of the problems, and are determined to build on the record of success getting fund managers abroad to see the attraction of diversifying into China’s debt.
Efforts will be made to “improve the liquidity of local government bonds in the secondary market,” Xu Jinghua, an official with the Ministry of Finance’s treasury department, said at a briefing Friday, though she stopped short of spelling out specifics.
Authorities will “steadily push forward the opening up” of the local debt market as they aim to “ensure smooth issuance” of government bonds this year, Xu said.
At the end of the day, it could all come down to price.
“I may consider buying some LGBs if they can provide spreads of 30 basis points over policy bank notes,” Goh said.

Investing.com – Wall Street ended higher Tuesday as investors continue to bet on economic recovery in the second half of the year even as widespread protests in the U.S. threatened to slow the pace of reopening nationwide.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.05%, or 267 points, the S&P 500 gained 0.83%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.59%.
Violent protests continued to erupt across U.S. cities over the death of George Floyd and threaten to undo some of the economic reopening progress made so far.
Several companies, including  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) temporarily shut some of their stores as protests turned violent.
But the civil unrest has done little to cool investor sentiment on stocks, with sectors sensitive to the reopening progress such as manufacturers, energy companies and banks adding to their recent gains.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) rose 2.8% and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was up about 1.95%, while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) rose 0.83% after pledging to commit $1 billion over four years to support economic and racial inequality accelerated by a global pandemic.
Energy was the biggest gainer on the day, underpinned by rising oil prices amid growing expectations major producers will extend production cuts when they meet virtually later this week.
RBC Capital Markets' Helima Croft said major oil producers are expected to agree a one- to three-month extension.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Meatpacker JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) is being sued for alleged violation of indigenous workers' rights after firing 40 members of the Kaingang tribe from a plant in southern Brazil, according to a court document.
The suit filed on June 1 by the labor prosecutor's office alleged that JBS discriminated against these workers as the novel coronavirus pandemic escalated in the country.
JBS shares fell 1.37% in late-afternoon trading, after rising as much as 1% at the open. 
""They were dismissed in a critical period, when the return to the labor market is unlikely until the pandemic is controlled,"" Labor Prosecutor Edson Rodrigues Junior said. 
The goal of the prosecutor's office is to force JBS to re-hire the indigenous workers. The prosecutor is also seeking at least 10 million reais ($1.9 million) in fines and damages. 
A decision is pending.
The dismissed employees of the Kaingang tribe commuted from the Serrinha indigenous land, where there were at least two confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to the court filing. 
JBS confirmed dismissing 40 indigenous workers from its Seara chicken-slaughtering plant, but said the decision came after the company discontinued a bus service that brought the workers to the plant every day. 
JBS gave no reason for discontinuing the bus service, and denied any discrimination. 
Fernanda Kaingang, a lawyer representing the dismissed workers, told Reuters by telephone the two people sick with COVID-19 in the Serrinha indigenous land did not work for JBS, but for another meatpacker in the area.
The lawyer said the dismissed JBS workers earned a net 1,200 reais ($230.10) per month and were ""surprised"" when they learned they had been fired.
At least one fired indigenous worker was a pregnant woman, the lawsuit and the lawyer said. JBS denied this, adding all women employees in such a condition were placed on leave. 
JBS noted the dismissed workers were paid in full what they were entitled to, and added that the plant in the town of Seara employs 3,700 people, including 200 from indigenous communities in surrounding areas.
The indigenous workers at the plant were preemptively placed on leave as required by law to protect them amid the pandemic, JBS said.

The company said the workers fired on May 6 traveled 300 kilometers (186.4 miles) every day to get to the plant on transportation arranged by the company.

(Reuters) - A California appeals court on Tuesday heard arguments in the first case that went to trial over allegations that  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN)'s glyphosate-based weed killer Roundup causes cancer, resulting in a $289 million judgment against the company.
The August 2018 jury verdict in favor of groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson, later reduced by a judge to $78 million, launched massive litigation over the weed killer that has led Bayer (OTC:BAYRY)'s stock price to tumble more than 30%.
A favorable appeals court decision in the Johnson case could help Bayer pressure plaintiffs' lawyers in settlement negotiations currently underway. Under California law, appeals courts have 90 days to issue a ruling following arguments.
During Tuesday's one-hour hearing, a three-judge panel peppered lawyers for Bayer and Johnson with technical legal questions that did not reveal which way they might be leaning.
Bayer has asked the court to overturn the verdict or order a new trial.
Bayer's lawyer, David Axelrad, said regulators around the world have found glyphosate to be non-carcinogenic, upending claims that Bayer has failed to warn about the product's cancer risks.
Johnson's lawyer, Michael Miller, argued the company has engaged in decades of deceit to mislead the scientific community about glyphosate's safety. 
Bayer denies those claims and insists Roundup and glyphosate are safe for human use. 
Bayer was found liable in two other U.S. Roundup jury trials and ordered to pay billions of dollars. Those verdicts were also reduced and are being appealed, but the massive awards sparked a slew of lawsuits.
Bayer in April said it was facing 52,500 U.S. lawsuits over Roundup, which it acquired with its $63 billion purchase of  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) in 2018. 

Bayer is pursuing an out-of-court settlement of the litigation, which analysts estimate could result in a $10 billion agreement. The company in February said it would not have to write down the value of the Monsanto acquisition in case of such a deal with plaintiffs.

Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on the $12 billion SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Bond ETF, ticker JNK, sank below 2% -- a four-year low -- after surging to as high as 25% in early March, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. For the $25 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, ticker HYG, bearish wagers are at the lowest level this year.
After the Fed pledged to shore up credit markets in March, investors have rushed in to front run the move, with the announcement alone causing enough demand to restore order. The central bank’s backstop is giving investors confidence to step into the market despite growing social unrest, uncertainty about coronavirus spread and increased tension between the U.S. and China.
“We are seeing investors get long high yield as the market continues to recover,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs for WallachBeth Capital.
In May, HYG saw the best month of inflows in its history, with $4.3 billion added, and its assets ballooned to a record. JNK took in $994 million -- its third straight month of inflows. Both have risen more than 21% from their March 23 lows.
Despite the enthusiasm for junk-bond ETFs, the central bank’s purchases so far have been concentrated in high-grade funds such as the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, ticker LQD, and Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF, or VCIT. The Fed has bought barely $3 billion of corporate debt-tracking funds as of May 26, just 1.2% of the $252.7 billion market for credit ETFs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Tuesday urged six major manufacturers to equip turbine-powered helicopters with crash-resistant systems to record data, audio and images, after former NBA star Kobe Bryant and eight others were killed in a helicopter crash in January.
The NTSB asked Airbus Helicopters (PA:AIR), Bell - a unit of  Textron Inc  (N:TXT) Leonardo, MD Helicopters, Robinson Helicopter Co and Sikorsky, a unit of  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) – to act after U.S. regulators have not backed mandating the equipment despite a series of recommendations since 2013.
Bryant, 41, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other people died when a twin-engine Sikorsky S-76B helicopter slammed into a hillside outside Los Angeles in heavy fog on Jan. 26. The helicopter did not have a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder.
The safety board found that a ""lack of recorded data hindered their understanding of several crashes that could have serious flight safety implications.""
The manufacturers did not immediately respond to requests for comment or declined immediate comment. The Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately comment.
Some helicopters are required by the FAA to have crash-resistant systems to record flight data and cockpit audio but none are required to have image-recording capability. Some operators have voluntarily equipped their helicopters with recording systems, including image-recording capability.
The NTSB cited seven helicopter investigations between 2011 and 2017, in which the lack of access to recorded data impeded their ability to identify and address potential safety issues.
The NTSB said 86% of 185 turbine-powered helicopter accidents it investigated between 2005 and 2017 had no recording equipment installed. The NTSB also asked manufacturers to provide a way to retrofit existing helicopters with recording systems.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Several automakers on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected May sales in the United States, and the Detroit automakers said they will work through their annual summer shutdowns to rebuild inventories as demand recovers from coronavirus shutdowns.
The U.S. auto sector has reopened assembly plants following the shutdown and automakers that reported May sales said they saw signs of recovery in consumer demand.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), said overall U.S. sales fell about 26% in May, but retail demand rebounded to 86% of levels in May 2019, exceeding the company's forecasts. Retail sales almost doubled from April to May, a spokesman said.
 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) said overall U.S. sales in May fell 13%, but that was significantly better than the 33% industry decline Cox Automotive had forecast. Hyundai cited a 5% increase in retail sales.
No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (N:GM) said it will keep building vehicles at most of its U.S. plants ""to meet strengthening customer demand,"" instead of taking a traditional two-week summer shutdown starting June 29, GM spokesman Jim Cain said.
""Our share has been increasing and we want to be able to carry that momentum through to the other side of the pandemic,"" he said. 
Half of  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) eight U.S. assembly plants have reduced their shutdowns to one week. Others are shifting their breaks to later in the year.
GM and Ford no longer report monthly U.S. sales.

The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers, closely followed by the auto sector, showed that 64% of those polled in May said it was a good time to buy a car. That was up from 57% in April and the highest level since December. Those saying times were bad or the future was uncertain fell to 28% from 38% the prior month.

He expects rates to remain very low for as far as the eye can see, with deflation a bigger risk than rising prices. He believes this is an ideal environment for gold to appreciate and he is betting on the metal.
The former chief economist at Merrill Lynch now runs his own firm, Rosenberg Research. Being independent allows him to make unfettered and honest research calls without the oversight and institutional constraints at a larger firm.
Rosenberg notes of the 10 million jobs recovered since the 2008-09 financial crisis, all of those -- and more -- were lost during the first month of the coronavirus crisis. Worse yet, the jobs newly created since the end of the Great Recession included many of the low-skill, low-wage variety -- jobs that generally don't offer the possibility of working remotely from home. He expects at least 10 million of these sorts of jobs will never be regained.
There are now 41 million unemployed workers, and it will get worse before it gets better, according to Rosenberg.  He noted that the U.S. economy already was on thin ice, with low corporate capital investment and expenditures, and little profit growth. Industrial production and exports also were weak.

816,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Financing hunt during pandemic lifts May U.S. convertible debt issuance to record,"By Kate Duguid and Imani Moise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. issuance of convertible bonds in May hit a record high of $20.7 billion, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) data, as companies struggling with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic ventured into the one-time niche market seeking cheaper and easier ways to borrow cash.
Convertible bonds, typically popular in tech and healthcare, saw the likes of Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) and cruise line Carnival (N:CCL) come to market with the second and third biggest deals of the year, according to Dealogic data. This wave of issuance has been met with increased demand from traditional debt and equity investors with less experience in the market, on top of typical inflows, convertible bond specialists said. 
""We have seen a pickup in demand from non-traditional convert investors,"" said Michael Youngworth, head of convertible bond strategy at Bank of America. ""I've received lots of calls from either traditional credit investors or some traditional equity investors who are looking to get into converts now.""
The unique structure of the debt allows investors to bet that the price of the stock will rise significantly, usually within five years. That has attracted investors looking to position themselves for an eventual economic recovery.
""To the extent there is a downturn again, you're safer being in the convertible tranche than the equity tranche,"" said Santosh Sreenivasan, head of equity-linked capital markets for the Americas at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
About $20.7 billion in new U.S. convertible debt was issued in May, according to Bank of America, the highest monthly volume on record. The previous high was $19.2 billion in May 2001. 
Beyond its appeal as a recovery trade, investors have been drawn to the market's valuations and return. The price of the iShares Convertible Bond ETF (Z:ICVT) is up 6.49% this year, while the S&P 500 index (SPX) has fallen 5.24%.
The convert market has also been a refuge for equity investors, said Joe Wysocki, who manages the long-only convertible fund at Calamos Investments. 
""You're seeing companies cut dividends. As an equity investor, convertibles allow you to stay invested, to keep the equity upside,"" said Wysocki.
Convertible debt is a hybrid security, offering a regular fixed payout like a bond, while giving bondholders the right to trade their debt for equity if shares rise over a certain price. 
While the possibility of an equity payout is drawing new investors in, bankers selling issuers on this structure are highlighting the slim chances of a conversion, according to banking sources who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
Banks began pitching convertible deals early the pandemic, after plummeting stock values ground equity issuance to a halt. Since then the product has become the biggest source of fee growth for equity bankers, according to Refinitiv data. Convertibles have made up 34% of U.S. equity deals so far this year, up from 19% last year. The deals were seen as a solution for companies who needed cash but did not want to sell shares at lower valuations, bank sources said. 
The ability to issue debt in a zero interest rate environment, and the slim chance the debt would be converted into equity was attractive to companies, those bankers said. Convertible deals are typically structured so the stock would need to rise 75% to 100% before investors could convert, a bank source said.
Desperation for cash, however, has led issuers to make some concessions. Conversion premiums - the amount the conversion price exceeds the current share price - have been falling, according to Wysocki.

""That's good for investors like ourselves because you're paying less of a premium so the chances of that getting in the money are higher,"" Wysocki said.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain wants binding commitments from the European Union on financial market access to avoid the country's finance industry suddenly being cut off from the bloc, a request Brussels has rejected, EU officials and diplomats said.
Britain left the EU in January and a transition period ends in December, when future access for banks, insurers and asset managers will be based on ""equivalence,"" a limited form of access used by the United States, Japan and Singapore.
Brussels grants market access to any ""third country"" if it deems its rules are equivalent or as robust as those in the EU.
But Britain wants special treatment to ensure its finance industry has more predictable access to the EU, which is Britain's biggest financial services export market, worth about 26 billion pounds ($32.58 billion) annually. 
""The UK is seeking co-management of financial equivalence decisions,"" an EU diplomat said on Tuesday.
""They want an in-built consultation process so that unilateral revoking of any licences would not be as easy as it is for third countries currently,"" the person said.
The European Commission, which is negotiating with Britain on behalf of the 27 EU countries, has rejected the idea, the person said.
An EU official said Britain wanted ""binding joint procedures for withdrawing equivalence.""
Broader UK-EU trade talks have continued this week with clashes over fishing rights, an industry that employs around 8,000 people in Britain, compared with more than a million in finance, based on data from finance industry body TheCityUK.
Under the EU's current system, Brussels can withdraw equivalence with 30 days' notice and Britain wants a much longer notice period.
The EU says granting and revoking equivalence is a unilateral decision and some EU lawmakers want to toughen up the process by adding a monitoring system.
""We need to ensure that equivalence is not only in place on the day of separation, but remains in place for the long run,"" senior EU lawmaker Markus Ferber said on Tuesday.
The political declaration on the shape of future trade relations signed by London and Brussels last year said each side would be autonomous in financial regulation.
""The EU has always said equivalence is 100% their competence and the third country has no say, so giving the UK regulators any degree of input would be a shift,"" a senior official at an international bank said.

Lenders have so far issued over 31.3 billion pounds ($39 billion) to more than 745,000 businesses through government-backed schemes, according to UK Finance which represents finance and banking firms in London. As of May 31, banks have lent more than 3.8 billion pounds, with demand for emergency loans continuing in the coming days, it said.
“Lending provided under government-backed schemes is a debt not a grant,” said Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance. “Firms should carefully consider their ability to repay before applying.”
The U.K. government has put in place emergency schemes to help the economy survive the lockdown, which has brought business to a halt for more than two months. It launched the so-called Bounce Back Loans, which are loans administered by commercial banks but 100% guaranteed by the state.
That followed other initiatives such as the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, which launched on March 23, and offers guarantees on 80% of the debt. The CBILS scheme attracted criticism from small firms given the difficulties getting access and the high interest rates applied by lenders.
Banks are in the hot seat as they are under pressure to lend, but at the same time want to avoid a pile of bad loans accumulating in their portfolios.
The regulators have relaxed the capital requirements to allow banks to lend but firms have already booked multi-billions of provisions in the first-quarter in anticipation of loans going sour. And more may come, some analysts have warned.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc’s Finance director Tushar Morzaria told analysts following the first-quarter results, that “there’s no doubt there will be some folks that will not be able to repay these loans.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) and  Barclays  Plc (L:BARC) will pay $20.7 million to resolve investors' claims they conspired to rig the Mexican government bond market, the first of nine banks in the proposed class-action litigation to settle.
In a Monday night filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for the investors said the ""ice breaker"" settlements could be a catalyst for settlements with the other bank defendants.
These defendants include affiliates of  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), BBVA (MC:BBVA),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), HSBC and UBS.
JPMorgan is paying $15 million, and Barclays is paying $5.7 million. Both denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Neither bank immediately responded on Tuesday to request for comment.
Investors led by several pension funds accused the defendant banks of operating as a ""cartel"" from January 2006 to April 2017 by sharing pricing and other transaction data, including through chatrooms, to maximize their profits at investors' expense.
The private litigation began after Mexico's antitrust watchdog, the Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE), began a probe into possible collusion.
That culminated last October in accusations against seven of the banks.
Monday's settlements require approval by U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken. He had dismissed the lawsuit last September, but let the investors amend their complaint.

824,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>",One-Third of America’s Record Unemployment Payout Hasn’t Arrived,"(Bloomberg) -- Almost one-third of unemployment benefits estimated to be owed to the millions of Americans who lost their jobs as a result of the coronavirus slump haven’t been paid yet, as flagship policies struggle to cope with the unprecedented wave of layoffs.
The Treasury disbursed $146 billion in unemployment benefits in the three months through May, according to data published Monday -- more than in the whole of 2009, when jobless rates peaked after the financial crisis.But even that historic figure falls short of a total bill that should have reached about $214 billion for the period, according to Bloomberg calculations based on weekly unemployment filings and the average size of those claims.
The estimated gap of some $67 billion shows how emergency efforts to boost payments, and deliver them via creaking state-level systems, are lagging the needs of a jobs crisis that’s seen more than 40 million people file for unemployment as the economy shut down.
Safety Net
The gaps in America’s social safety net are becoming apparent at the same time as protests erupt over longstanding racial inequities. The debate over how and when to reopen businesses even as the pandemic continues is also turning acrimonious, in a nation that increasingly feels like a tinderbox.There’s “a huge hole,” said Jay Shambaugh, an economist at Brookings Institution who has been tracking the unemployment payments. “There’s a lot more money that should have gone out that has not gone out.”
The bill is still mounting. Economists estimate that another 1.8 million people filed for unemployment last week. That data is due out on Thursday, while Friday’s monthly numbers are forecast to show a jobless rate of 19.5% in May, the highest since the Great Depression.
When the pandemic struck, policy makers responded with a $600-a-week boost to unemployment benefits, alongside measures to make more people eligible. The aim was to stop the spread of the virus by encouraging laid-off workers to stay home, and cushion its economic impact by replacing lost incomes, sometimes in full.
But for many people the money simply hasn’t turned up.
‘Running Out’
Bob Radcliffe, who lives in Morristown, New Jersey, lost his job selling touchscreen displays to retailers in early March. He filed for unemployment shortly afterwards, expecting to get the state’s maximum payment, about $1,300 a week after the federal top-up.By that reckoning, he’s now owed almost $15,000. But Radcliffe, who has four children under eight, says he still hasn’t received any benefits or an explanation for the holdup. For now, he’s taking advantage of the three-month mortgage forbearance on offer at his bank, and surviving on his last commission check.
“I’ve had money to live. I’m not a desperate case,” he said. “But I’m running out.”
The Treasury reports its unemployment disbursements daily. Bloomberg’s calculation of what should have been paid is based on continuing claims for benefits, including those filed under a special program that widened the safety net to include contractors and gig workers. (It assumes filings for missing weeks in May will be in line with the average in preceding weeks).Those claims were multiplied by the weekly unemployment benefit, using the $378 state average plus the $600 boost that’s due to expire at the end of July.
State Backlogs
In response to questions from Bloomberg News, a spokesperson for the Labor Department said that using its weekly claims report, which delineates those filing for continuing benefits each week, was “not an effective data point to get at unpaid claims.” The department doesn’t track how many claims haven’t been paid, the spokesperson said.“It is also challenging to use these numbers because states are struggling to keep up with demand and some have backlogs they are working through,” the spokesperson said.
When all that paperwork is done, the Bloomberg calculation probably understates the total amount owed to unemployed Americans. It doesn’t include the millions of workers around the country still waiting to have claims processed by overloaded systems, or the retroactive benefits owed to some of the 7.8 million people now claiming under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for independent contractors. That 7.8 million figure is also incomplete because not all states have reported how many of their residents have filed PUA claims.
‘Protracted Recovery’
In Texas where more than 2.6 million unique claims for jobless benefits have been filed since March, the backlog of cases still waiting to be verified at the end of last week stood at almost 650,000.The state has expanded call centers and redeployed other workers to help deal with the claims. But attention has also shifted to other tasks like reopening the economy and helping people find jobs, though that will take time.
One in five workers in the state’s oil and gas industry, for example, has filed for unemployment. Those jobs will probably come back in the end, according to Jesse Thompson, a senior business economist at the Houston branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, but it may take until early 2022 to run off the inventories of crude oil that piled up while the economy was in lockdown. “It’s going to be a protracted recovery.”
Nationally, economists expect the economy to be creating jobs again in the second half of this year –- possibly at record rates, as states reopen. The bill for unemployment benefits will likely peak in May or June, according to Shambaugh at Brookings.
Republicans and Democrats have begun debating whether to extend at least some of the extra unemployment payments beyond their July expiration date. Business owners have complained that the benefits, which on average equate to an annual salary of more than $50,000, are discouraging employees from returning to work. But scrapping them could prompt a new crisis for millions of families and slow the economy’s recovery.
‘Fiscal Fatigue’
Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton LLP, says that failure to extend benefits may end up prolonging the crisis. But she’s worried that Congress, which has approved emergency measures worth some $2.2 trillion during the pandemic, may be suffering from “fiscal fatigue.”
“We’re really talking about an economy that is going to be operating at a fraction of its capacity for a long period of time,” she said.
At the local level, underinvestment has left many states with ageing computer systems and unemployment programs that can seem more designed to slow payments than expedite them. Small mistakes can hold up claims for weeks. So can things like forgotten online passwords, with some states insisting on sending new ones out by the post, according to Michele Evermore, a senior researcher at the National Employment Law Project who’s been documenting such shortcomings for years.
The delays also point to the difference in the scale of the unemployment crisis in the U.S. versus European and other advanced economies with more robust safety nets.
Stimulus checks of as much as $1,200 per adult from the federal government have helped many families pay the rent or initial food bills. But that amounts to a little more than a week’s unemployment benefits for many who lost their jobs.“On paper the U.S. strategy is very generous,” said Ernie Tedeschi, a former U.S. Treasury economist now at Evercore ISI. “But that generosity on paper is meaningless if it doesn’t translate into actual money in people’s pockets when they need it.”

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU regulators are seeking feedback about a possible new power to investigate businesses and demand changes even when no competition rules have been broken, in a move aimed at stopping companies from abusing their dominance.
The prospective power underlines a European Commission push for a speedier and a more effective antitrust capability and came after a decade-long battle with Google (O:GOOG) which rivals said has not resulted in any effective changes.
The new initiative would be similar to one introduced by Britain's Competition and Markets Authority three years ago which subsequently led to a shake-up of the UK audit market following an investigation.
The Commission said the new power aims to address gaps in existing competition rules and to intervene against structural competition problems across markets in a timely way.
""After establishing a structural competition problem through a rigorous market investigation during which rights of defense are fully respected, the new tool should allow the Commission to impose behavioral and where appropriate, structural remedies,"" the EU executive said.
""However, there would be no finding of an infringement, nor would any fines be imposed on the market participants,"" it said.
The new effort could target industries ranging from tech to beverages to digital agriculture.
Areas of concern include the creation of powerful market players with an entrenched market or acting as gatekeepers, and markets where companies are unable to enter because of lack of access to data and other barriers, or where consumers are locked in to companies which offer a diverse range of services.

The consultation period runs to Sept. 8, with the Commission planning to roll out legislation in the final quarter of 2020.

(Reuters) - What started as a bear market bounce in U.S. equities has transformed into one of the most dramatic rallies in memory, leaving investors looking to past rebounds, options markets and technical analysis for clues on how far it could run. 
The S&P 500 is up 37% since its late March close as of Monday and the Nasdaq Composite is near a fresh record after a surge that has seemingly ignored widespread economic upheaval and uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic. 
The rally’s speed has left investors in a quandary. While few are willing to bet against a rebound that has steam-rolled most forecasts, some are concerned the market has become detached from economic reality by expectations of unlimited support from the Federal Reserve and U.S. lawmakers. 
The S&P 500, for instance, now trades at 21.2 times earnings, its highest level since 2002, even as unemployment is at levels last seen in the Great Depression. A Reuters poll showed investors expect Friday's U.S. employment data to show a loss of 7.45 million jobs cut in May, after a record 20.5 million in the previous month. 
(GRAPHIC: Strength in numbers - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/azgvobnjqpd/200%20dma.JPG)
U.S. stocks rose Monday after days of widespread protests and civil unrest over racial inequities and excessive police force. 
“We’re in a different game and trying to establish what is fair value is difficult,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
Those looking to history believe the split between Wall Street and Main Street is unlikely to last. The S&P 500 has never reached a bottom in less than six months after falling more than 30% during a recession, according to a study by BofA Global Research looking at markets over nearly nine decades. 
If that dynamic holds true, it means the S&P is due to eventually revisit its March 23 low of 2,191.86, 28% below where the index closed Monday - a potentially unfavorable outcome for investors who have piled into the recent bounce. 
The bank’s research also shows that longer recessions tend to produce longer bear markets - another worrying sign for a rally that has taken the S&P within 10% of its all-time high with little evidence of a recovery in sight. 
The belief that policymakers will backstop markets may be creating a bubble that is pushing investors to buy stocks “despite their better judgment,” said Benjamin Bowler, global head of equity derivatives research for Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC).
“That sets stocks up for an even more violent correction, because you have a lot of people with no conviction in the trades they are in,” he said. 
A Société Générale study examining bear markets over the last 150 years shows gains in past bounces off a bottom have been slower, with the S&P notching an average of 11% in the first three months after drops of 30% or more. After two years, the average gain from the bottom stood around 40% - roughly what the index has gained since late March. 
Such rebounds have also featured strong economically-sensitive cyclical stocks, which have struggled to mount a consistent rally this time around, the bank said. 
Many market participants, however, argue that the unprecedented level of support by policymakers may produce a reaction inconsistent with previous market recoveries. 
A Reuters poll of nearly 50 market strategists and fund managers in late May showed the S&P ending the year at 2,950, just below current levels.
The Fed ""had to focus investors to look past the current numbers ... otherwise it would have taken years for the S&P to get back to 3,000,"" said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at NatAlliance Securities, in a note. 
Some technical analysis also paints a brighter picture. The rally has lifted the S&P 500 above its 200-day moving average and more than 90% of the index's stocks now trade above their respective 50-day moving averages, said Andrew Thrasher, portfolio manager at Financial Enhancement Group. 
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 Index forward price to earnings ratio - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdkoalvo/PE.jpg)
""We haven't seen this level of internal strength by individual stocks until after major downturns ended,"" he said. 

But investors remain cautious: options on the S&P 500 show traders assigning a 29% probability that the index will fall 10% or more in the next three months, compared with a 12% probability for an advance of 10% or more.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Tuesday, even as the wave of sometimes violent protests in response to the killing of an unarmed black man by policy weighed on hopes for a successful reopening of the U.S. economy as the Covid-19 pandemic eases.
By 10:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 218 points, or 0.9%, while the S&P 500 was 0.5% higher. The Nasdaq Composite, inched up by 0.1%, reversing earlier losses.
The optimism caused by the sight of dozens of states slowly relaxing restrictions on business and social life has run into some second thoughts, as a wave of protests against the killing of George Floyd has engendered looting and anti-police violence on the one side, and unrestrained abuse of peaceful protesters and media on the other.  
New York City, which is still emerging from its Covid-19 lockdown, will be under curfew for a second straight evening on Tuesday after widespread looting in Lower Manhattan late on Monday. With similar scenes being replicated in cities across the country, the hoped-for return of consumers to shops, bars, movie theaters and the like is being pushed back. 
Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock fell 1.0%, having earlier been the subject of reports saying it would ask staff to choose between unpaid leave and reduced working hours as it plots a slow path back to normality.
That the rebound in consumer demand may be elusive was also evident in China overnight, where it emerged that Apple is discounting its new iPhone models heavily to sustain sales.  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 0.1%.
Elsewhere, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) stock rose 1.8% after reporting that online sales more than doubled in the three months through April, although same-store sales fell 30% due to Covid-19 related lockdowns.
In other markets, U.S. crude oil futures rose to their highest since early March on hopes for an extension of the output cuts agreed in April by OPEC and other major exporters (chiefly Russia). By 10:30, it was up 2.0% at $36.16, slightly off its intraday highs. Gold rose 0.2% to $1,753.65 a troy ounce."

833,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",Trade war tradeoff: How a Missouri town got America’s dirtiest air,"By Tim McLaughlin
MARSTON, Missouri (Reuters) - The residents of New Madrid County cheered in 2018 when a bankrupt aluminum smelter that rises over the Missouri region’s vast farm fields restarted operations and hiring, thanks to aluminum tariffs levied in President Donald Trump’s trade war.
The smelter reclaimed its place as one of New Madrid’s biggest employers, with more than 500 workers. But the resurrection has come at a cost.
The soot pouring out of its smokestacks last year consistently produced the dirtiest air recorded in America, according to a Reuters review of pollution monitor data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. (For a graphic on the pollution from the smelter's smokestacks, see https://tmsnrt.rs/2ZUAbrT )
The unhealthy air underscores the tension between industrial development and the environment as the Trump administration rolls back regulations on drilling, mining and manufacturing to boost the economy.
Charles Reali - the chief executive of Magnitude 7 Metals LLC, which owns the smelter - acknowledged the plant’s high pollution levels in an interview with Reuters. But he said the only guaranteed way to fix the problem - installing a wet scrubber filtration system - would easily cost more than $100 million, an expense the plant’s revenues will not support.
In a proposal that could directly impact New Madrid, Trump’s EPA announced in April it would reject a proposal from the agency’s scientific staff to tighten U.S. soot pollution standards. Health advocates claim the existing standards are too weak and are contributing to higher death rates during the coronavirus pandemic. New Madrid has recorded 15 cases of the disease and one death as of May 21, according to state and local authorities.
But in a county that ranks last or near the bottom in every quality of life and health standard, many people are willing to accept dirtier air in exchange for more jobs, according to interviews with two dozen residents there.
“People are worried about getting food on the table,” said Marvelle Cranford, pastor of Friendship Church of God in Christ in Howardville, a small, predominantly African-American community about 5 miles from the plant. “Morale is good when people are employed. It’s not good when they are not.”
The elevated sulfur dioxide levels in the the area are not on the radar of U.S. Congressman Jason Smith, a Republican whose district includes New Madrid County. “Our office has not heard anything about this issue from the community,” said Jonathon Matthews, a spokesman for the congressman.
SHORT SMOKESTACK
The Magnitude 7 Metals facility and the power plant next door that supplies its electricity together emitted about 30,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution in 2019, according to the EPA data.
While the power plant produces the bulk of the chemicals, the smelter’s shortest smokestacks – at about 50 feet – are one-sixteenth as tall, which means its pollution has an outsize impact at ground level.
Monitors stationed near the two facilities captured SO2 concentrations of at least 200 parts per billion (ppb) on 165 days in 2019, the first full year after its restart. That’s nearly triple the EPA’s standard for SO2 of 75 ppb.
This gave the area around the smelter the nation’s highest median EPA air quality index score at 131 for 2019. Anything over 100 is considered unhealthy. The next highest median AQI reading in the country last year was 80, in California’s San Bernardino County, where smoke from raging wildfires fouled the air.
So far this year, the plant’s pollution exceeded EPA standards 119 times through May 24th, according to preliminary data kept by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. By contrast, readings in 2017 – the year the monitors were installed, and before the smelter restarted – were consistently less than 10 ppb.
In a sign the poor air quality may be harming local residents, death rates in the county from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are 87% higher than in the rest of the state, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Health studies cited by the EPA show that just a few minutes of exposure to SO2 at concentrations of 200 ppb can restrict the breathing of people with asthma.
The smelter polluted the air before the smelter’s bankruptcy, too, said Darcy Bybee, director of Missouri air pollution control program, but there were no air monitors to capture daily readings. 
Bybee said people living outside the immediate perimeter of the two plants are breathing air that complies with federal standards, according to an evaluation by her program.
George DeLisle, coroner for New Madrid County, said the outcomes are likely exacerbated by poor behaviors like smoking. He did not comment on the impact of pollution from the plants.
Jayne Dees, administrator of the New Madrid County Health Department, said she cannot remember an instance when someone in the town raised a concern about pollution: “No one has ever brought it up.”
‘PRAYER MODE’
Construction of the smelter was completed in 1971, after Missouri’s governor at the time convinced Associated Electric Cooperative to build the coal-fired plant next door to provide power. The smelter historically has been Missouri’s largest user of electricity.
In 2014, the New Madrid smelter produced about 557 million pounds, or 253,000 tons, of primary aluminum, or about 15% of U.S. production, according to commodities consultancy CRU International Limited.
But the smelter’s parent company landed in bankruptcy in 2016, under heavy debt and facing a flood of cheaper metals from China.
Former  Glencore  Plc (L:GLEN) trader Matt Lucke bought the plant out of bankruptcy in 2016 for about $14 million. And Trump’s trade war later helped revive U.S. steel and aluminum producers.
But things haven’t worked out as planned, said Reali, the Magnitude 7 Metals executive. The price per ton has dropped to about $1,500 due to soft demand and high global stockpiles, about $1,000 below the plant’s business plan.
“We are in prayer mode,” Reali told Reuters.Because of the bad air, the EPA is expected to rule on a recommendation by Missouri regulators to designate the perimeter of the smelter and power plant as a “nonattainment” area under the 2010 National Ambient Air Quality Standards. 
That means the zone will have to eventually have come into compliance with clean air standards. Associated Electric Cooperative Inc, which operates the coal plant for its owners, declined to comment for this story. 
The Trump administration’s decision not to tighten soot standards could make it easier for Magnitude 7 Metals to comply with the EPA air standards. One way to do that would be to install a taller smokestack, according to Missouri DNR officials.
A decade ago, the former owner of the plant, Noranda Aluminum, proposed installing a new 233-foot tall smokestack to cast pollution farther away but never followed through.
Reali said such a job - with no guarantee of solving the plant’s pollution problems - would cost around $14 million these days and his business probably wouldn’t survive that financial hit.

“It was BS,” Reali said. “They proposed it just to make things go away.”

(Reuters) -  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) is developing easier-to-administer versions of its antiviral treatment remdesivir for COVID-19 that could be used outside of hospitals, including ones that can be inhaled, after trials showed moderate effectiveness for the drug given by infusion.
Remdesivir is the only drug so far that has been shown to help patients with COVID-19, but Gilead and other companies are looking for ways to make it work better. 
For critically ill patients, Roche (S:ROG) and Eli Lilly and Co (N:LLY) are testing drugs in combination with remdesivir.
Gilead is also seeking to treat the virus earlier. Other antivirals, like influenza pill Tamiflu, work best when given as early as possible after someone becomes infected.
Gilead in a statement on Monday said it is looking at ways to use remdesivir earlier in the course of disease, including via alternate formulations. The company confirmed in an email that it is researching an inhaled version, but declined further comment.
Company executives such as Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey and Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dickinson have been doing interviews with Wall Street analysts in recent weeks to discuss the plans, which are in early stages. 
They have said that in the longer term, the company is exploring a subcutaneous injection formulation of remdesivir, as well as dry powder versions to be inhaled. Remdesivir cannot be given as a pill because it has a chemical makeup that would degrade in the liver, and the intravenous (IV) formulation is only used by hospitals.
In the short term, Gilead is studying how its existing IV formulation of remdesivir can be diluted for use with a nebulizer - a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs. 
The idea is that a nebulizer would make remdesivir more directly available to upper airway and lung tissue as the coronavirus is known to attack the lungs. It would also allow for early treatment of coronavirus patients who are not hospitalized.
""People look forward to an inhaled formulation in time,"" but development is in the very early stages, said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Michael Yee, adding that demand may be limited as many people infected with the virus require minimal treatment.
He said Gilead is building up its capacity to supply remdesivir and has begun talking to governments around the world about commercial pricing.
Gilead on Monday reported trial results showing that IV remdesivir provided a modest benefit for hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 compared to standard care.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, with investors continuing to look for an economic recovery despite mounting civic unrest and increasing Sino-U.S. tensions.
At 06:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.6%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 60 points, or 0.6%. The Dow Futures contract rose 170 points, or 0.7%. 
This optimism is despite President Donald Trump threatening to deploy the military in U.S. cities. in response to the violent unrest that has followed last week’s death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of police, 
On top of this, relations between China and the U.S. remain strained over the autonomy of Hong Kong, after Beijing passed new national security laws related to the city.
Reports Monday of an order from China's government to halt U.S. soybean purchases raised the possibility of damaging trade disagreements between Washington and Beijing, just a few months after the first phase of a trade deal ending a damaging trade war. Chinese backsliding on the deal would give Trump the pretext to raise import tariffs on its goods again. 
That said, the latest U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index pointed to improvement in May from April, even though the reading was grim. The market is also still supported by trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus and the reopening of states as the coronavirus outbreak passes its peak.
In corporate news, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will be in focus after a number of employees walked out Monday in protest against the tech giant's decision not to remove or flag a controversial post by Trump last week. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will also be in the spotlight after cutting prices for its new iPhone models in China, its second-biggest market.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL) P&O Cruises said it is extending its pause in sailings to the middle of October as it continues to grapple with the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) is set to report earnings after the bell, and expectations for the company, which has become synonymous with working under lockdown restrictions for the Covid-19 pandemic, are high.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, with traders expecting the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, to bring forward its next meeting to later this week in order to discuss whether to extend record production cuts beyond end-June.
The American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of U.S. oil inventories after the bell. Last week the API reported that crude stockpiles climbed by 8.7 million barrels, bucking the recent downward trend.
At 5:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.7% higher at $36.38 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.6% to $39.30.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Winning bidder for Grindr has ties to Chinese owner,"By Echo Wang, Alexandra Alper and Chibuike Oguh
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An investor group that got U.S. approval to buy Grindr Inc has financial and personal links to the dating app's current owner, China's  Beijing Kunlun Tech  Co Ltd (SZ:300418), Reuters has found, in a possible departure from Washington’s national security policy on deals.
Kunlun said on Friday that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) had cleared the sale of Grindr to San Vicente Acquisition LLC for more than $600 million, but did not give details about the investor group.
A Reuters review of confidential fundraising documents and interviews with two sources familiar with the deal show that a close business associate of Kunlun's founder tried to raise money for a fund to buy Grindr. Two of the partners in that fund eventually became part of San Vicente. 
Kunlun also offered financing support to San Vicente that it didn't extend to two other groups, according to two other sources familiar with some of the other bidders.
CFIUS declined to comment on the deal, including on whether it was aware of the links between Kunlun and San Vicente, which have not been previously reported.
When presented with Reuters' findings, a Grindr spokeswoman said: ""The buyers for Grindr were selected after an extensive and unbiased bidding process that complied fully with all applicable regulations, as the receipt of all necessary approvals - including CFIUS - demonstrates.""
Reuters could not determine what representations Kunlun had made to CFIUS, and whether the links between Kunlun and the buyer raised red flags with the panel. However, some experts said any situation in which the seller retained influence over the asset it had been ordered to sell could draw scrutiny from CFIUS and trigger penalties under U.S. law.
CFIUS ordered Kunlun to divest Grindr in May 2019, giving the Chinese company until June 30, 2020 for the deal to be completed. The U.S. panel was concerned that personal data of U.S. citizens held by Grindr, such as private messages and HIV status, could be compromised after Kunlun gave access to the app’s database to employees in China, sources previously told Reuters. 
Kunlun’s founder Zhou Yahui was hoping that the company would have enough time to pursue an initial public offering of Grindr that would value it at between $800 million and $1 billion, according to a source familiar with his thinking. 
One of Zhou’s advisers on the sale of Grindr was Ding’an Fei, according to six people familiar with the sale process. 
A former employee of private equity firm Warburg Pincus, Fei had advised Kunlun in its $245 million acquisition of Grindr over two transactions in 2016 and 2018. He also previously served on the dating app’s board, according to the fundraising documents and three of the sources familiar with the matter. 
Fei was also a senior executive at Duo Capital, an investment manager that set up a fund to buy Grindr following the CFIUS order to Kunlun, according to the fundraising documents and two of the sources. 
Duo Capital’s senior team included James Lu, a former executive at Chinese internet search engine Baidu Inc (O:BIDU), and George Raymond Zage, the chief executive of family office Tiga Investments Pte Ltd, the documents show. 
Reuters could not determine what happened to Fei’s efforts to raise money to buy Grindr. But Lu and Zage, alongside U.S. basketball team Atlanta Hawks co-owner Michael Gearon, are the main owners of the San Vicente consortium that agreed to acquire Grindr, the six people familiar with the matter said. 
Fei is not part of San Vicente, two of the sources said. 
A regulatory filing shows San Vicente was incorporated in Delaware on Feb. 19, just weeks before the deal with Kunlun. The company is named after the Los Angeles street where Grindr has its headquarters. 
A spokesman for San Vicente referred to Grindr’s statement and declined to comment further.
Grindr, Kunlun and San Vicente declined to comment on Fei’s role and respond to questions. Fei, Lu, Zage and Gearon did not respond to requests for comment. Zhou also did not respond to requests for comment.
In the fundraising documents, which are not dated, Duo Capital said Kunlun had offered to provide five-year financing of up to 50% of the deal’s consideration to it at “nominal interest rates.” 
When the deal with San Vicente was sealed, Kunlun ended up providing financing by deferring payments on more than 40% of the deal’s consideration for up to three years, filings with the Chinese stock market regulator show. But at least two other bidders for Grindr - private equity firm Catapult Capital LLC and technology firm Bending Spoons SpA - were not offered such deferred payments, according to the two sources familiar with the other bidders.
Bending Spoons declined to comment and Catapult did not respond to requests for comment.
TIES BETWEEN BUYER AND SELLER
CFIUS, a secretive panel made up of officials from the Treasury, Defense and other U.S. departments and agencies, reviews deals of overseas companies and investors to assess whether they would harm national security, but does not disclose the reasons for its decisions. Lawyers who have represented companies during reviews and former government officials said CFIUS is typically wary of any ties between companies that it orders to divest assets and the acquirers. 
In one previous case, for example, President Donald Trump wrote in an order in March upholding a CFIUS ruling that the panel may consider whether an acquirer had a “direct or indirect contractual, financial, familiar, employment or other close and continuous relationship” with the seller, its employees or shareholders. 
Nicholas Klein, a lawyer at DLA Piper who advises companies on CFIUS issues and reviewed Reuters’ findings, said he was surprised by the CFIUS decision to allow the sale to San Vicente, given the personal and financial ties between the buyer and the seller. 
Klein said the connection between Kunlun and San Vicente might raise concerns that the Chinese company could retain some control over Grindr, something that CFIUS would not want. But he noted that Kunlun may have provided some assurances to CFIUS that have not been disclosed. 
Klein added that material misstatements and omissions in filings with CFIUS or failures to comply with the terms of the divestiture could lead to civil penalties under U.S. law. 

Reuters could not determine if Kunlun made any adjustments to the deal to satisfy CFIUS.

Value stocks, which tend to track economic cycles more than their growth counterparts, have started to shine after long periods of underperformance. Last week the Russell 1000 Value Index beat the growth gauge by more than two percentage points, and bested it the week before as well. While there’s debate about how quickly economies can recover from the pandemic, equity-derivatives strategist Mandy Xu said it’s worth building in that possibility.
“For value to outperform sustainably, we need to see a significant pickup in economic growth -– which, in the current environment, means believing in more of a ‘V’ shaped recovery than is currently priced in,” Xu wrote in a note Monday. “We think it’s worthwhile hedging this right-tail risk, especially in light of the still cautious investor positioning.”
While a rotation to value stocks from growth has been predicted by strategists many times, the recent outperformance has revived those forecasts. It isn’t clear that the trend can be sustained -- Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA said it’s skeptical of the equity rally due to the “wobbly” performance of cyclically-oriented shares. Credit Suisse says there’s enough of a chance and it’s worth being prepared.
Xu recommends buying call-option spreads in the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, which has been an underperformer so far this year. Bullish option activity has started to pick up in that exchange-traded fund in recent weeks, she said.

Investing.com -- Europe’s economic engine is turning up the revs.
Germany’s DAX index crossed the 12,000 mark for the first time since March on Tuesday amid reports that the government is set to approve a new fiscal stimulus package worth an estimated 80 billion euros.
According to the newspaper Bild am Sonntag, the package is set to include handouts for families with children and possibly the assumption of local government debts by the federal government to create more space for spending on essential services.
However, the most interesting part for investors is that the government is once again set to pour billions into supporting the auto industry, which in recent years has supported well over 14% of all jobs in the country, directly and indirectly.
As a consequence, the big three names are all flying, with Daimler (OTC:DDAIF), the maker of Mercedes-Benz, leading the way: Daimler shares rose 9.5%. They’ve now recouped all the losses suffered since the first week of March, despite the profound long-term uncertainty over the outlook for the car industry that the pandemic has created.
Daimler’s luxury car rival BMW was also purring. BMW stock was up 5.9%, while Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock was up 6.3%. The DAX itself was up 3.5% by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), while the STOXX 600 was up 1.5%.
The country’s biggest suppliers to the auto industry also breathed a huge sigh of relief: Continental (DE:CONG) stock rose 6.0% and Covestro (DE:1COV) rose 5.9%. Among midcaps,  Fuchs Petrolub (DE:FPEG_p) stock gained 18% and Hella (DE:HLE) stock rose 7.8%.
“Without state support, the labor market and companies face a long recession, due to the dramatic consequences of the pandemic,” said Deutsche Bank strategist Ulrich Stephan in a morning note.
In contrast to the Great Recession of 2009, the government had held off from rushing to the auto sector’s help in the pandemic, a consequence of the political damage that the industry did itself with the Dieselgate scandal. The optics of state support for luxury carmakers in particular haven’t been helped either by the fact that both Daimler and BMW are still paying dividends to their shareholders.
Reports suggest that much of the sectoral support will be focused on improving overall environmental performance.
Even so, the main takeaway is that a government which still has the capacity to borrow heavily to ride out a temporary crisis is doing so, having convinced itself that doing less will end up just as expensive in terms of damage to the country’s industrial and human capital. Good news for Germany and good news for Europe, especially the central European economies which have been integrated most tightly into its supply chains."

LONDON (Reuters) -  Tesco 's (L:TSCO) finance chief, who helped steer the group from an accounting scandal to a successful turnaround, is to retire, setting the stage for an entirely new top executive team at Britain's biggest retailer by next May.
Alan Stewart will depart next April, Tesco said on Tuesday, six months after CEO Dave Lewis is due to step down and be replaced by Ken Murphy, a former executive at healthcare group Walgreens Boots Alliance (O:WBA). 
Tesco was on its knees in September 2014 when Stewart left Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) to join the supermarket group as chief financial officer. The accounting scandal knocked millions off Tesco's profits and billions from its share price.
In April 2015 the group reported an annual loss of 6.4 billion pounds ($8 billion), one of the biggest in British corporate history. 
But by October last year Lewis, CEO since 2014, declared Tesco's turnaround complete and this April it reported annual core profits of 3 billion pounds ($3.8 billion).
""Along with Dave Lewis, he (Stewart) is a key component in effectively saving Tesco,"" said Shore Capital analyst Clive Black.
Shares in Tesco were down 1.8% at 0852 GMT, extending 2020 losses to 10.7%.
Tesco said in its statement that Stewart had led its corporate restructuring, rebuilt its balance sheet, guided it back to investment grade and played a huge role in the financial transformation of the business in the last six years.
Stewart will leave on April 30, 2021, and the board will now conduct a thorough search both internally and externally to identify a successor, it said.
That means from May 2021, Tesco Chairman John Allan will have a totally new main board executive team.
Tesco said Stewart has been granted ""good leaver"" status for his various deferred bonuses and share schemes, conditional on him not taking up employment as a director, consultant or adviser with retail sector competitors for six months after he leaves.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Polestar, the premium electric vehicle maker owned by China's Geely, plans a big expansion of its showroom network in the mainland, sources said, as it prepares for delivery of cars to compete with Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) locally made Model 3.
Showroom strength is becoming an important differentiator for electric vehicle (EV) makers in the world's biggest auto and EV market, as they line up new model launches.
Polestar, which plans to deliver Polestar 2 electric sedans in China from July, currently has one showroom, in the capital Beijing. It plans to have 20 showrooms, with most of them opening in the third quarter of this year.
Unlike sales of cars through dealers that most traditional automakers rely on, Polestar will sell directly to customers, a strategy also pursued by other EV makers including Tesla, Nio Inc (N:NIO) and Xpeng Motors, backed by  Alibaba  (N:BABA). 
Direct sales to customers can help automakers to better manage a car's retail price and its production and inventory. However, it also adds to costs if automakers need to invest in self-owned showrooms like Tesla.
Polestar, however, will partner with investors to build and operate the showrooms while still managing sales and delivery of cars, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the plan is not public.
A Polestar representative declined to comment.
The automaker, based in Gothenburg, Sweden, started producing Polestar 2 sedans earlier this year in China and will also export them to Europe and the United States.
It will open showrooms firstly in Shanghai and then expand to coastal Ningbo, northern Tianjin and southern Guangzhou. The showrooms will be mostly in shopping malls.

In China, Tesla has over 50 showrooms. Nio currently operates around 110 showrooms, with some of the properties belonging to partners. Xpeng plans to have over 200 outlets by the end of the year from about 150 now, many of them belonging to partners.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Embraer seeks business partners but not a repeat of the Boeing deal,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The world's No. 3 planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3) is open to new business partners after  Boeing Co  (N:BA) ditched a $4.2 billion deal that was years in the making, the Brazilian company's chief executive told Reuters. 
But Francisco Gomes Neto said any new agreement would be smaller in scope than the failed venture with Boeing. 
""We are not looking for a partnership of the size that the company had with Boeing,"" he said. ""We think that it would be faster and more efficient to have partnerships by project.""
To do so, Gomes Neto will undo the costly separation process that readied Embraer's profitable commercial jet division for Boeing's takeover and bring all of its employees back under the same corporate roof.
The two companies are now engaged in competing arbitration proceedings, having each filed claims against the other separately over whether the necessary conditions for the Embraer-Boeing deal were met.
When Boeing canceled the planned deal in April just as the coronavirus ravaged the travel industry, Embraer was left with no plan B.
Gomes Neto acknowledged Embraer is only now drafting a five-year business plan for the commercial jets division which Boeing would have run. Embraer drew up similar plans last year for its defense and executive jet units which were going to remain independent from Boeing. 
The commercial unit makes mid-range jets of up to 150 passengers, which compete directly with the Airbus A220. That plane was initially developed by a smaller company, Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF), whose jet project was acquired by the European planemaker. 
Gomes Neto, who took over after the Boeing deal was initially signed, is now remaking Embraer as a company focused on finding smaller, more targeted partnerships. 
A new turboprop aircraft that Embraer wishes to develop but no longer has the cash to finance could potentially spawn one deal, he said. 
""In these first few years coming out of the crisis we are going to have to prioritize many investments,"" Gomes Neto said. ""We have reduced all investments, some of them are close to zero."" 
Reuters reported on Friday that China, India and Russia were evaluating potential partnerships with Embraer.
""We don't have any negotiations going on at the moment, but without a doubt they are potential partners,"" Gomes Neto said of those countries. ""We are evaluating those markets in this moment ... but it's still in an embryonic stage."" 
Another potential partnership involves the KC-390 military cargo plane which Boeing was once going to help market. While Gomes Neto said China could be a partner for commercial jets, the calculus is more complex for a military plane that was going to be marketed to U.S. allies in partnership with Boeing. 

""The military arena is a bit more delicate ... so for now we are going to focus on our original business plan for the KC-390,"" he said. ""So a partnership would only be a second stage.""

843,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>","Australia's Woolworths to reward over 100,000 staff with shares for virus efforts","(Reuters) - Australia's biggest supermarket chain Woolworths Group said on Tuesday it will reward more than 100,000 of its staff with free company shares for their efforts during a period of upheaval amid bushfires and the coronavirus buying frenzy.
The company said it would give full-time employees up to A$750 ($510) of shares each to keep or sell, while part-time staff would get shares on a pro-rata basis. Casual staff would get cash bonuses or store discounts.
The move reflects the outsize role - and sales receipts - of grocery stores around the world as governments raced to shut down restaurants, pubs and most other public gathering places to slow the spread of the new coronavirus in March.
It also comes after several top Australian companies, including Woolworths, faced heavy criticism recently after admitting to underpaying workers. Woolworths said in October it had underpaid thousands of its supermarket staff up to A$300 million for years, prompting a government agency to say it would investigate the company.
As the outbreak started to widen, Australians took to loading up shopping trolleys with non-perishable items like toilet paper, dried pasta and disinfectant to the point where the prime minister went on television to ask the nation to ""stop hoarding"".
As airlines, discretionary retailers and casinos laid off staff by the tens of thousand, Woolworths and No. 2 rival  Coles Group  (OTC:CLEGF) Ltd had to hire people to restock shelves and carry out ""social distancing"" measures like installing protective screens.
Before the virus, in the southern summer months of December and January, Australia's grocery giants kept stores open even though many of their staff were affected by bushfires which ripped through the country's southeast.

(Reuters) - European stocks hit their highest levels since early March on Tuesday, with German stocks outperforming as carmakers rallied on hopes of stimulus and Lufthansa gained after its board approved a state bailout. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 1.4% to reclaim levels not seen since March 9. Traders in Germany returned from a long weekend to drive the DAX up 3.2% to its highest since March 5. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and BMW (DE:BMWG) gained between 5.9% and 9% on a Reuters report on Sunday that the country's Ministry of Economics had proposed a 5 billion euro buyer bonus scheme to boost car sales.
Europe's automobiles & parts index (SXAP) jumped 4.9%, leading gains, while insurers (SXIP), real estate (SX86P) and banking (SX7P) rose between 2.5% and 3%. 
Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) surged 6.3% as its supervisory board approved a 9 billion euro ($10 billion) government bailout even as it forced the German airline to give some of its prized landing slots to rivals.
German leaders are expected to present a stimulus package on Tuesday worth 75 billion-80 billion euros ($83 billion-$89 billion) to support economic recovery after the coronavirus pandemic, according to a media report.
""Broadly firmer stock markets continue to keep market sentiment risk-on,"" UniCredit analysts wrote in a morning note.
""Investors swept aside a succession of negative news and focused on brighter economic prospects as more and more countries ease containment measures.""
With restrictions easing across the globe, data on Tuesday suggested the worst may be over for European manufacturers. All eyes are on the European Central Bank meeting later this week, where policymakers are expected to ramp up bond purchases.
Gains across the other markets were tempered by U.S.-China tensions, with Wall Street futures coming under pressure after President Donald Trump vowed to use the military to halt protests over the death of a black man in police custody.
France's biggest private TV operator TF1 (PA:TFFP) jumped 7.8% as it announced the launch of a new soccer channel 'Telefoot' along with its partner MediaPro Group.

Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Tuesday, amid optimism over a post-coronavirus economic recovery, with the German market outperforming as it returns after a three-day weekend amid talk of a fresh government stimulus package.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 3.1% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 1.7%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.7%. The pan-Europe Stoxx 600 index gained 1.3%, hitting its highest level since March 9.
Earlier Tuesday, Australia’s central bank kept its interest rate and yield objectives unchanged amid early signs of a recovery. “It is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected,” Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement.
Signs of economic recovery are overshadowing continued civil unrest in the U.S., with President Donald Trump threatening on Monday to use force to quell the ongoing protests in dozens of U.S. cities over the death of George Floyd.
Additionally, Sino-U.S. tensions remain strained, with China ordering state-owned firms to halt purchases of U.S. soybeans and pork in retaliation for President Donald Trump's announcement that he would end special treatment for Hong Kong.
In corporate news Tuesday, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) surged 7% as its supervisory board approved a 9 billion euro ($10 billion) government bailout for the airline. The bailout faces legal challenges from the likes of Ryanair on antitrust grounds.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p),  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Bayerische Motoren Werke (DE:BMWG) all gained over 5% on a Reuters report that the country's Ministry of Economics had proposed a 5 billion euro buyer bonus scheme to boost car sales. The scheme may be discussed later as part of a cabinet meeting on a new stimulus package, according to German media.
Elsewhere, Norway's  Seadrill  (OL:SDRL), which only re-emerged from bankruptcy two years ago, slid 9.3% as it announced it has written down the value of its oil drilling rigs by $1.2 billion and hired bankers and lawyers to evaluate a financial restructuring that could allow the company to reduce its $7.4 billion debt.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, with traders expecting the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, to bring forward its next meeting to later this week in order to discuss whether to extend record production cuts beyond end-June.
The American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of U.S. oil inventories after the bell. Last week the API reported that crude stockpiles climbed by 8.7 million barrels, bucking the recent downward trend.
At 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $35.73 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.2% to $38.77.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,745.15/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1135, flat on the day.

Qatar's state-run LNG producer signed agreements with South Korea's ""Big 3"" shipyards on Monday to secure more than 100 ships through 2027, in the largest-ever single LNG vessel order.
With a steep market downturn on the horizon, the orders had come at the right time for  Daewoo Shipbuilding  & Marine Engineering Co Ltd (KS:042660), Hyundai Heavy Industries Holdings Co Ltd (KS:267250) and Samsung (KS:005930) Heavy Industries Co Ltd (KS:010140), analysts said.
""They would have been worrying about their own survival next year if they didn't win this Qatar deal,"" said Lee Dong-heon, an analyst at Daishin Securities, who estimated the trio would now have an order backlog stretching a year-and-a-half.
Shares in the three shipbuilders rallied over 20% on Tuesday.
""This is the largest single LNG vessel order in history. We have never seen so many LNG vessels ordered in the same year, let alone by a single buyer,"" said Saul Kavonic, analyst from  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN). 
The industry has been suffering from a prolonged shipbuilding slump that has led to massive losses, job cuts and a bailout from the government. Lee said market forecasts had indicated a 30% fall in orders this year from a year ago.
Park Moon-hyun, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment Corp, said the deal could be a ""opportunity for South Korean shipbuilders to overcome setbacks they have faced ... and focus on what they are good at.""
QP did not announce breakdown orders for each company. 
Samsung Heavy said it expects to sign deals starting this year through 2024 and expected a positive impact on orders by shipping companies who are considering LNG vessels. Both Hyundai Heavy and Daewoo Shipbuilding declined to comment.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Tuesday as investors' focus on the prospects of a global coronavirus recovery won out over familiar worries about U.S.-China relations and the depth of economic damage.
Hampering broader global risk appetite, however, was U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to use force to end violent protests in American cities, which kept Wall Street stock futures negative in Asia.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which had its best day in two months on Monday, extended its rally without panache - rising 0.41%.
European stocks were headed for a strong start with the pan-region EUROSTOXX 50 futures up 0.71%, FTSE futures gaining 0.52% and German DAX futures up 0.59% in Asian afternoon trade.
The dollar nursed heavy losses, but steadied, and bonds firmed.
The week had begun with a surge in riskier currencies and global equities after Trump's response to China's tightening grip on Hong Kong - with threats, not tariffs - was seen lowering the temperature of Sino-U.S. tension.
Reports of an order from China's government to halt U.S. soybean purchases, though, again raised the spectre of damaging trade disagreements between Washington and Beijing.
""There's increasing concern about further deterioration in relations between China and the U.S.,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.
""In the meantime, we're hanging in there...but I think we might be getting a little exhausted given the giddy heights that we're trading at.""
World stock markets have rallied nearly 36% from March lows on hopes for a swift recovery from a pandemic that has killed nearly 375,000 people and crushed global growth as countries have shut down to try and slow the virus' spread.
May Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data pointed to a fragile but encouraging rebound in global manufacturing - driving hopes that the worst is over.
Japan's Nikkei rose 1.17% to its highest since late February and markets in Seoul, Taipei and Hong Kong also gained.
""This optimistic read for risk can only persist if measures like orders and employment continue to improve month to month,"" said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""Early setbacks would be a very poor sign, but are not expected in the period immediately following the end of lockdowns.""
BOIL OVER
Currency and bond markets took a breather, and the safe-haven dollar scraped from multi-month lows against most major currencies and pushed bond yields lower.
The Australian dollar rose 0.04% and New Zealand dollar dipped 0.17% after strong Monday gains, and the dollar was a fraction over an 11-week low against a basket of currencies.
The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries gained about 2 basis point to 0.6640%.
The wave of outrage in the United States following the death of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis after being pinned beneath a white police officer's knee for nearly nine minutes, seems yet to weigh on global investors' sentiment.
Still, the unrest has dozens of U.S. cities under curfew, racial tensions at boiling point and some analysts worrying it presents yet another hurdle to national economic recovery, or even invites a second wave of coronavirus infections. U.S. stock futures were off 0.3% in Asian afternoon trade. 
Some 40 million Americans have lost jobs since mid-March and many states are emerging from lockdowns, even as daily new case numbers are only very slowly trending downward.
""It wouldn't take a lot for (case numbers) to start rising again,"" said ING's head of research in Asia, Rob Carnell, who said markets' nonchalance may not persist if, as Trump warned, troops are called out to put down protests.
Oil futures steadied with traders waiting to see whether major producers agree to extend output cuts at an OPEC+ meeting later in the week. Brent futures rose 1.12% a barrel to $38.75 and U.S. crude was up 0.85% at $35.74 a barrel. 

Spot gold was steady at $1,737.07 an ounce.

PARIS (Reuters) - French retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) said on Tuesday it had agreed to buy food retailer Wellcome Taiwan from Asia's Dairy Farm (SI:DAIR), making it the number two player in Taiwan's convenience stores market.
The transaction, with an enterprise value of 97 million euros ($108.00 million), covers the purchase of 224 stores as well as a warehouse and is expected to close by the end of the year, the statement said.
Wellcome Taiwan posted net sales of around 390 million euros in 2019.
Carrefour, which currently operates 137 stores in Taiwan, including 69 convenience stores under the Market banner, is the country's fifth largest retailer. PX Mart is the largest convenience store operator.
Carrefour posted net sales in Taiwan of nearly 2 billion euros, EBITDA of 209 million euros and recurring operating income of 83 million euros in 2019.
While it expands in Taiwan, Carrefour is retreating from the highly competitive Chinese market where, last year, it sold 80% of its loss-making operations to electronics retailer Suning.com.

Administrator Deloitte said they had been selected from five non-binding proposals received on Friday. It is seeking a binding agreement with the winning bidder by June 30.
The others that had lodged proposals included BGH Capital, Indigo Partners and Brookfield Asset Management, Reuters had previously reported.
Virgin owed nearly A$7 billion ($4.76 billion) to creditors when it entered voluntary administration in April with its long-running financial struggles exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.
The next phase for the parties on the final shortlist will include further engagement with stakeholders and aircraft financiers as they seek agreements on future terms before binding bids are received, Deloitte has said.
The strong interest in Virgin at a time when the world aviation market is largely grounded shows the long-time attractiveness of the Australian domestic market, a duopoly between Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Virgin.
Bain, which owns Trans Maldivian Airways, is being advised on its Virgin offer by Jayne Hrdlicka, the former head of Qantas budget airline Jetstar.
Cyrus was an investor in Virgin America alongside Virgin founder Richard Branson before its sale to Alaska Airlines. Cyrus also invested in collapsed British carrier Flybe with Virgin Atlantic.

MADRID/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Forget fast or slow fashion, now it's ground to a halt. 
A mountain of apparel stock has been piling up in stores, distribution centers, warehouses and even shipping containers during months of COVID-19 lockdowns. As retailers reopen around the world, they have to work out how to get rid of it.
Their main options? Keep it in storage, hold a sale, offload it to ""off-price"" retailers like TJ Maxx which sell branded goods at deep discounts, or move it to online resale sites.
None are ideal, and all are damage-limitation.
Real estate company Knight Frank told Reuters it had fielded inquiries for excess stock for over 6 million square feet(557,500 square meters) of short-term let warehouse space in Britain since the pandemic took hold there in March. 
Yet storage is only a realistic option for evergreen ""basics"" that are not tied to one particular year and could be sold at a later date should consumer demand bounce back - items like underwear, t-shirts, chinos and classic sneaker styles.
Apparel chains including British high-street retailer  Next  (L:NXT) and German sportswear brand Adidas (DE:ADSGn) said they had stashed away unsold basics, with the aim to offer them to shoppers next year instead. 
But stowing away piles of inventory is risky. 
""This is not like wine that gets better with age. Your inventory gets worse,"" said Emanuel Chirico, chief executive of PVH Corp (NYSE:PVH), which owns Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, on a recent earnings call.
In the United States, clothing sales fell 89% in April from the same month in 2019, while in Britain clothing sales sank by 50% compared with an already-squeezed March. 
Retailers hope that easing of lockdown measures will see shoppers return to stores, eager to unleash pent-up demand. But there is no guarantee that sales will rebound any time soon.
DUMPING INVENTORY
Many stores are likely to pursue a combination of holding sales as well selling stock to off-price retailers. The mix will depend on consumer appetite, how much merchandise stores have to shift and how fast they must free up space for new collections.
In-store discounts are usually a better option as dumping inventory in bulk to off-price players returns just pennies on the dollar for the retailers. 
Off-price retail group TJX (N:TJX), which started opening its TJ Maxx and Marshalls stores this month, said in May there was ""incredible availability"" of stock on the market.
UK-based Parker Lane Group, which helps companies manage excess stock and advises on selling off-price, is processing at least double its usual volume of up to 1.5 million items of apparel per month, founder Raffy Kassardjian told Reuters. 
""Some of our customers are waiting for retail to open up to gauge their performance before they make a commitment on how much stock they want to write off,"" he said, referring to both selling at discount in-store and offloading to off-price.
'MOST INSANE SALES'
Potentially more lucrative is moving merchandise to online re-sale marketplaces that take a commission on sales, although that option is largely only open for high-end brands. 
California-based luxury re-sale marketplace Tradesy opened a new business unit in April to deal with the jump in brands looking to sell stock they were stuck with after department stores canceled wholesale orders, said CEO Tracy DiNunzio.
""A number of these brands are set to go live in the next couple of months,"" she said, adding some may set up their own landing page on Tradesy while others would sell more discreetly.
Apparel was still the number-one category for spending cutbacks among U.S. consumers surveyed by Coresight Research on May 20. Non-essential retailers are set to reopen on June 8 in New York City and June 15 in Britain.
Even some shoppers are plotting a quick profit using re-sale websites. 
""We're going to see the most insane sales,"" said Melissa McAvoy, founder of events company Luxury Experience & Co, who lives in the celebrity-studded Los Angeles suburb of Calabasas. 
The 43-year-old said she planned to snap up merchandise at a discount, to then resell it at a higher price online at a site such as California-based Poshmark, which also makes money by taking a commission on sales.

""I'm going to get a tonne of stuff and either wear it once or put it on Poshmark,"" she said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to open in a mixed fashion Tuesday, with cautious trading likely given the fraught relationship between the U.S. and China and the civil unrest throughout America.
At 2:00 AM ET (0600 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.3% lower, underperforming its rival indices. France's CAC 40 futures were up 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
Investors are having to balance cautious optimism about the reopening of the global economy, after the social distancing measures that were taken to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, against heightened tensions between the U.S. and China and civil unrest in Hong Kong and the U.S., in particular.
Earlier Tuesday, Australia’s central bank kept its interest rate and yield objectives unchanged amid early signs of a recovery. “It is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected,” Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said in a statement.
That followed stronger than expected economic data from the U.S. on Monday, with the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers' index showing the contraction of factory activity was slowing.
That said, Sino-U.S. tensions remain strained, with China ordering state-owned firms to halt purchases of U.S. soybeans and pork in retaliation for President Donald Trump's announcement that he would end special treatment for Hong Kong.
Additionally, investors’ nerves will be stretched after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Monday to use force to quell the ongoing protests in dozens of U.S. cities over the death of George Floyd.
Also of interest Tuesday, British and EU negotiators will begin their fourth and final scheduled round of Brexit trade talks.  
In corporate news Tuesday,  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) has accelerated its expansion into Taiwan, with the French retail giant entering into an agreement to acquire Wellcome Taiwan.
 Seadrill  (OL:SDRL) has written down the value of its oil drilling rigs by $1.2 billion and hired bankers and lawyers to evaluate a financial restructuring that could allow the company to reduce its $7.4 billion debt.
Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, with traders expecting the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, a grouping known as OPEC+, to bring forward its next meeting to later this week in order to discuss whether to extend record production cuts beyond end-June.
The American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of U.S. oil inventories after the bell. Last week the API reported that crude stockpiles climbed by 8.7 million barrels, bucking the recent downward trend.
At 2:00 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $35.66 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 0.8% to $38.62.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,749.50/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1135, flat on the day.

The company on Monday announced its intention to delist from the New York Stock Exchange later this month, while maintaining its Oslo Bourse listing.
Seadrill, controlled by Norwegian-born shipping tycoon John Fredriksen, had been struggling even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit oil prices and dented demand for drilling rigs.
""This industry has two fundamental challenges which are emphasized by recent events - there are too many rigs carrying too much debt,"" Chief Executive Anton Dibowitz said in a statement.
""We recognize, along with others in the sector, that a number of our assets are increasingly unlikely to return to the market and need to be scrapped,"" he said.
Following the impairment, the company reported a net loss of $1.57 billion for the first quarter, an increase from a loss of $295 million during the same quarter a year ago.

Investing.com – Shinsei Bank (T:8303) sealed its biggest overseas acquisition to date, announcing on Tuesday that it would buy UDC Finance, New Zealand’s biggest non-bank financier.
Shinsei will pay NZ$762 million ($476.801 million) to owner Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, with UDC to become a wholly-owned subsidiary.
UDC provides car loans as well as asset financing, products also offered by some Shinsei units, and fits into the bank’s focus on small-scale finance.
“Through this stock acquisition, and by leveraging its expertise in small-scale finance business, Shinsei Bank envisages further growth of UDC in New Zealand where the GDP growth rate is relatively high among the developed countries,” the bank said in a statement.
Shinsei last tapped markets overseas in 2006, when it paid around JPY 40 billion ($371.64 million) for a stake in Taiwanese bank Jih Sun Financial.
Meanwhile, ANZ finally offloaded an asset that it has tried to sell several times, with the last attempt to sell it to China’s HNA Group for NZ$ 660 million blocked by the New Zealand’s Overseas Investment Office in December 2017.
Shinsei stocks were up 2.04% to JPY1403 ($13.035) by 12:51 PM ET (5:52 AM GMT)."

Zip will offer 119 million shares, or about 23% of the company, to shareholders of QuadPay for the remaining 86% of the U.S. firm it does not already own.
Larger rivals like Afterpay Ltd (AX:APT) and Sweden's Klarna have flourished in the United States, building on the BNPL sector's growing popularity, especially with millennials, as it allows consumers to buy products in interest-free installments.
The news sent Zip shares soaring as much as 44% to A$5.40, their highest since October last year.
The firm also said it secured up to A$200 million ($135.70 million) from an affiliate of Susquehanna International Group through the issue of notes and warrants, highlighting growing investor interest in the space.
Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700) recently scooped up a 5% stake in Afterpay, just months after Ant Financial, an affiliate of  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA), bought a small stake in Klarna - which already counts Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) and rapper Snoop Dogg as backers.
Once the deal is completed, Zip said the combined company will have about 3.5 million customers and more than 26,000 merchants signed up, with annual revenue of over A$250 million.
The numbers are still far off the likes of Afterpay, which has more than five million active customers in an increasingly crowded U.S. market.
Last month, Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify Inc (TO:SHOP) said it would also enter the U.S. BNPL market later this year.

SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) - Shinsei Bank Ltd (T:8303) said it will buy New Zealand's top non-bank finance provider, UDC Finance Ltd, for $480 million in its biggest overseas acquisition to date and marking the latest asset purchase by a Japanese company eager to move beyond a low-growth home market.
The planned sale also relieves owner Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (AX:ANZ) of an asset it has tried to offload several times, part of a broad push by Australia's banking sector to focus on core services like mortgages and to limit regulatory problems.
The NZ$762 million price tag is higher than the $NZ660 million that New Zealand media said China's HNA Group had agreed to pay before the deal was blocked by a New Zealand regulator in 2017.
Shinsei said small-scale finance was a focus area and UDC, which sells auto and machinery financial products, was similar to several of its domestic finance units.
""Through this stock acquisition, and by leveraging its expertise in small-scale finance business, Shinsei Bank envisages further growth of UDC in New Zealand where the GDP growth rate is relatively high among the developed countries,"" it said in a statement.
The deal value tops Shinsei's roughly 40 billion yen ($370 million) purchase of a stake in Taiwanese bank Jih Sun Financial in 2006.
Japanese companies have been keen to tap offshore markets for growth due to thin margins and an ageing population at home.
Last year, Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group (T:8306) bought an asset management business from Australia's biggest lender, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), for $2.9 billion. In 2015, Japan Post Holdings Co (T:6178) bought Australian logistics company Toll Holdings for A$6.5 billion.

861,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 10:10PM ET</span>","Southwest offers buyout packages, temporary leaves to 'ensure survival'","By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) on Monday extended buyout packages and temporary paid leaves to employees in what its chief executive said was an effort to ""ensure survival"" as the carrier braces for a slow recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, according to documents detailing the packages that were seen by Reuters.
Southwest, which has not imposed any layoffs or furloughs in its 49-year history, said its flying capacity would probably be down about 30% in the fall.
""While overstaffing isn't tied 100% to capacity levels, it would be fair to assume that we are overstaffed in many areas by a similar percentage,"" Southwest said in the documents. 
Southwest is offering leaves of a minimum of six months with benefits and 50% pay for most employees, excluding pilots, who would receive about 61% pay. The maximum leave period varies, and the airline said it ""may return employees to work earlier if needed for operational needs."" 
Buyouts are being offered to employees depending on their time with the company. Employees with more than 10 years experience would receive a year's pay, health benefits and four years of flight privileges. Pilots would receive about two-thirds of their average salary for five years, or until they reach age 65.
""These programs are critical components to voluntarily reduce our workforce so that we can preserve the long-term viability of our company,"" Southwest Chief Executive Gary Kelly said in one document.
Southwest is among U.S. airlines that have received billions of dollars in government payroll aid which bans any forced job cuts before October. 
Jon Weaks, who heads the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association (SWAPA), said the packages had been well-received by pilots and noted the temporary leaves give the company flexibility to call employees back to work if demand picks up.
Weaks has said he believes that most of Southwest's staffing reductions could be achieved through voluntary measures.
Southwest called the packages the most generous in its history and as ""appealing as it could afford.""

The deadline to apply is July 15.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY) Plc and Chief Executive Michael O'Leary failed to persuade a U.S. judge to dismiss a securities fraud lawsuit accusing Europe's largest budget airline of defrauding them by downplaying its willingness to recognize labor unions.
While dismissing much of the proposed class action, U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken said shareholders could try to prove that Ryanair intended to mislead them with statements indicating a ""near certainty"" it would not welcome unions, the recognition of which could increase costs and reduce profitability.
The Manhattan judge said this included O'Leary's statement at Ryanair's September 2017 annual general meeting that hell would ""freeze over"" before the Dublin-based carrier accepted unions.
Such statements ""are impossible to reconcile with O'Leary's subsequent admission that he had 'long anticipated' unionization,"" and were ""direct evidence"" of possible intent to mislead shareholders, Oetken wrote.
Ryanair offered that December to recognize pilot unions, to avert a possible strike, and its American depositary shares fell 5.2% that day.
Oetken also dismissed claims concerning other statements about Ryanair's labor relations, profitability and growth targets, finding no proof the statements were false.
Ryanair and its law firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for the lead plaintiff did not immediately respond to similar requests.
The lawsuit was filed in November 2018 by an Alabama fund, the City of Birmingham Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension System, on behalf of Ryanair ADS investors from May 30, 2017 to Sept. 28, 2018.
Ryanair cited labor issues when it cut its full-year profit forecast on Oct. 1, 2018. Its share price closed that day more than one-third below its level in mid-March.
O'Leary has been Ryanair's chief executive since 1994.

The case is City of Birmingham Firemen's and Policemen's Supplemental Pension System v Ryanair Holdings Plc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-10330.

863,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>",Everything China Is Doing to Support Its Markets During Pandemic,"(Bloomberg) --
The deadly coronavirus outbreak has been met with a wide-ranging response from China’s policy makers seeking to cushion the economy, support financial markets and bolster investor confidence. Here’s a look at some of the steps taken, along with market reaction.
Monday, June 1
BUSINESS SUPPORT: China’s central bank said it will temporarily purchase loans made to small businesses from some local banks, a new policy to boost the supply of lending to the real economy. The plan will use 400 billion yuan ($56 billion) from a separate program to buy 40% of some loans to small and medium-sized firms. By taking loans to small businesses on to its balance sheet, the People’s Bank Of China may help lower lenders’ capital requirements and thereby lower the cost of further lending.
Sunday, May 10
STRONGER POLICIES: The People’s Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) said the country faces unprecedented economic challenges from the coronavirus pandemic and it will resort to “more powerful” policies to counter the hit to growth. The phrase “will avoid excess liquidity flooding the economy” was missing from the policy outlook section of its quarterly monetary policy implementation report. It was in the previous report for the fourth quarter of 2019.
Friday, April 24
TMLF CUT: The PBOC injected 56.1 billion yuan into the banking system via the targeted medium-term facility, just as 267.4 billion yuan of the debt comes due. The one-year funding was offered at an interest rate of 2.95%, lowered from the 3.15% of the last operation in January.
Tuesday, April 21
COVERAGE RATIO: Regulators will lower the bad-loan coverage ratio for mid-sized and small banks by 20 percentage points in phases, to unleash additional credit to support small and micro-sized businesses.
Monday, April 20
LPR CUT: Chinese banks lowered borrowing costs and the government promised to sell another 1 trillion yuan in special local bonds to pay for stimulus spending. The one-year loan prime rate was set at 3.85% versus 4.05% in March, while the five-year tenor, a reference for mortgages, was cut to 4.65% from 4.75%.
Wednesday, April 15
MLF CUT: The PBOC offered 100 billion yuan via the one-year medium-term lending facility, cutting the rate to 2.95% from 3.15%. The reduction was expected as the central bank already cut the rate on 7-day market operations in late March, and the different interest rates tend to move together.
Thursday, April 9
MARKET ROLE: China’s top leaders in a statement pledged a raft of measures to strengthen the role of the market in land use, capital markets and labor mobility to build a more efficient economy. Policy makers called for improvements to the country’s stock market infrastructure, faster development of the bond market and actively expanding financial-sector opening. They also promised to push forward the market reform of interest rates.
Friday, April 3
TARGETED RRR: The PBOC said it would cut the reserve ratio requirement for smaller banks by 1 percentage point in two phases. The targeted RRR cut will release around 400 billion yuan into the banking system, according to the PBOC.
Tuesday, March 31
CASH, BONDS: China’s cabinet calls for lower reserve-requirement ratios for small banks, more infrastructure bond sales by local authorities, and other steps including tax exemptions for people buying new-energy vehicles. The State Council meeting pledges another 1 trillion yuan of funding through the central bank’s relending and rediscounting program, essentially a cheap credit line for small commercial lenders.
Monday, March 30
MONETARY EASING: The PBOC reduces the interest rate on 7-day reverse repurchase agreements to 2.2% from 2.4% when it injected 50 billion yuan into the banking system. The cut is the largest since 2015.
Friday, March 27
FISCAL DEFICIT: China will increase its fiscal deficit as a share of gross domestic product, issue special sovereign debt and allow local governments to sell more infrastructure bonds as part of a package to stabilize the economy, Xinhua reports citing a Wednesday Politburo meeting.
Thursday, March 26
SUPPLY CHAINS: The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission issues a notice urging financial institutions to increase support to companies playing key roles in supply-chains as they resume work and production.
Monday, March 23
*MARKET REACTION: China’s small-cap ChiNext Index ends down 4.6% to take its slide from February’s high to more than 20%, marking its entry into a bear market.
Sunday, March 22
POTENTIAL GROWTH: A senior central bank official says the economy’s return to its potential growth rate will be swift, with significant improvement expected in the coming three months. The official repeats earlier pledges to keep credit growth stable and make good use of the central bank’s targeted easing approach.
Friday, March 20
NO CHANGE: China’s base rate for new bank loans is unexpectedly unchanged in March, indicating pressure on lenders’ margins and prompting calls for further cuts to policy rates. The one-year loan prime rate is kept at 4.05%, while the five-year tenor is also unchanged at 4.75%.
*MARKET REACTION: China’s overnight repurchase rate, a gauge of short-term liquidity in the interbank market falls to its lowest since Bloomberg started to compile the data in 2006.
Monday, March 16
INJECTING LIQUIDITY: The PBOC offers 100 billion yuan via the one-year medium-term lending facility, keeping the rate unchanged at 3.15%.
Friday, March 13
RRR CUT: China’s central bank cuts the amount of cash that banks have to set aside as reserves, in a move that will pump $79 billion into the economy, effective March 16.
CONSUMPTION BOOST: The National Development and Reform Commission says it will take measures to lift consumption, including improving the competitiveness of its products and services and the supply of imported products.
Thursday, March 12
BORROW MORE: China allows a higher cap on foreign debt, a move aimed at helping smaller and private companies raise more funds overseas.
Wednesday, March 11
BOND SALES: China’s central bank and securities regulator say they would provide “a better policy environment and more convenient terms” for private firms to raise money by issuing bonds. The PBOC says 209.5 billion yuan in bonds related to fighting the virus were issued as of March 10.
Wednesday, March 4
SOME SIGNALING: The likelihood of Chinese policy makers to further cut rates in open market operations this month is “not small,” state-run China Securities Journal writes in a front page commentary.
*MARKET REACTION: The yield on China’s 10-year sovereign bond falls to its lowest level in more than three years, after an emergency rate cut by the Federal Reserve fed expectations that China will ramp up stimulus. The yuan strengthens the most since December.
Sunday, March 1
DEBT RELIEF: Regulators provide more details on a prior pledge to extend repayment periods, saying qualified small- and medium-sized businesses with principal or interest due between Jan. 25 and June 30 can apply for a delay to the end of the second quarter. In Hubei province, the center of the outbreak, the waiver applies to all companies.
Tuesday, Feb. 25
CHEAP CREDIT: China pledges 500 billion yuan of relending and rediscounting funding to commercial banks for loans to small firms and the agricultural sector. The interest rate of the funding will be lowered by 25 basis points. The government will also waive value-added taxes for small firms in Hubei from March to May, and lower the tax rate to 1% from 3% for small firms in the rest of the country
Monday, Feb. 24
CONSIDERING CUTS: The PBOC is reviewing whether to cut the benchmark deposit rate due to the outbreak of the coronavirus, according to Deputy Governor Chen Yulu, who also said the central bank will guide borrowing costs lower.
*MARKET REACTION: China’s stock market turnover tops one trillion yuan for the fourth consecutive day, the first time that happened since November 2015.
Saturday, Feb. 22
SUPPORT BANKS: A PBOC official says the central bank will conduct a financial inclusion review soon on commercial banks and offer qualified lenders discounts on their reserve ratios.
Friday, Feb. 21
CHANGING STANCE: China’s top leaders pledge “more flexibility” in monetary policy and to be more “proactive” in using fiscal policy, indicating a greater easing bias compared with their previous stance, according to meeting details.
Thursday, Feb. 20
EVEN LOWER: China’s banks reduces the benchmark borrowing costs for new corporate and household loans. The one-year loan prime rate is lowered to 4.05% from 4.15% last month, and the five-year tenor is dropped to 4.75% from 4.8%.
Tuesday, Feb. 18
* MARKET REACTION: China’s stock recovery nears $1 trillion, drawing skeptics preparing for a sell-off. Expectations that the PBOC will continue easing monetary policy pushes China’s yield curve to its steepest level since 2015.
Monday, Feb. 17
RATE CUT: The central bank provides medium-term funding to commercial lenders and cuts the interest rate it charges for the money, offering 200 billion yuan of one-year loans. The rate is lowered by 10 basis points to 3.15%, the lowest since 2017.
* MARKET REACTION: The CSI 300 recoups all of its losses following the record $720 billion sell-off across the nation’s stock market.
Sunday, Feb 16

865,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",China Adds Teeth to Its Clean Electricity Targets This Year,"(Bloomberg) -- China boosted its clean energy targets for 2020 and said it would for the first time formally monitor whether provinces meet their goals or not.
Nationwide, the country is targeting 28.2% of electricity generation to come from renewable sources, up 0.3 percentage points from last year, the National Development and Reform Commission said in a statement. Non-hydro sources are expected to provide 10.8%, up 0.7 percentage points from last year.
The NDRC also gave individual targets for each province and region, excluding Tibet, which already gets a majority of its power from renewable sources. Grid operators, power generation firms and users will be held accountable for meeting the targets and could be punished with bad credibility records if they don’t.
The announcement came after China last week said it had space in its power grids to absorb 52% more wind and solar capacity this year than it added in 2019. The higher targets and increased capacity imply that renewable installations will increase this year,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts including Simon Lee said in a June 1 note.
China first introduced plans for a renewable energy quota system in late 2017, with implementation on a trial basis last year.
The system is designed to secure demand for clean energy while reducing idle capacity, and it should help the nation to meet its target to derive 15% of its total energy from non-fossil fuels this year, the agency said. China has developed more wind and solar capacity than any other country, but rapid expansion has left grids struggling to accept the influx of intermittent generation.
“The key factor regarding this policy is not the modest increase in 2020 renewable target but the establishment of a long-term monitoring and evaluation system to reduce curtailment,” Lee said in the note.

871,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 05:20PM ET</span>",U.S. court refuses to shield Volkswagen in diesel scandal lawsuits,"By David Shepardson and Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday that Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) cannot escape potential financial penalties from two counties in Florida and Utah that may amount to a ""staggering"" additional liability arising from the German automaker's diesel emissions scandal.
The unanimous ruling by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting in Anchorage, Alaska, was a victory for Utah's Salt Lake County and Florida's Hillsborough County. The counties sued VW for causing excess diesel emissions harmful to the environment and could in theory seek billions of dollars in damages.
Volkswagen settled U.S. criminal and civil actions prompted by the cheating scandal for more than $20 billion, but that did not shield it from liability from local and state governments, the 9th Circuit noted.
The 9th Circuit found that nothing in the Clean Air Act ""raises the inference that Congress intended to place manufacturers beyond the reach of state and local governments.""
Volkswagen has admitted to using illegal software to cheat U.S. pollution tests in 2015, allowing up to 40 times legally allowable emissions. 
The judges wrote that they were ""mindful that our conclusion may result in staggering liability for Volkswagen. But this result is due to conduct that could not have been anticipated by Congress: Volkswagen's intentional tampering with post-sale vehicles to increase air pollution.""
The two counties each have penalties of $5,000 per day for tampering violations and had a combined total of at least 6,100 polluting VW diesel vehicles. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who had ruled in the case in 2018, noted at the time that ""the potential penalties could reach $30.6 million per day and $11.2 billion per year.""
Volkswagen vowed to seek further review by the 9th Circuit or the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary, saying the ruling conflicts with the findings of other courts.
""Those other courts rightly recognized the chaos that would ensue if thousands of localities can regulate manufacturers' updates of their software systems, which are an inherent feature of modern vehicles and, in this case, reduced emissions,"" Volkswagen said.

The scandal triggered a global backlash against diesel vehicles that has so far cost VW 30 billion euros ($33.3 billion) in fines, penalties and vehicle buyback costs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. public companies sold more than $60 billion in shares in May, the biggest monthly haul ever, as they capitalized on a stock market rally fueled by hopes that the COVID-19 pandemic is subsiding.
The benchmark S&P 500 Index (SPX) has risen around 40% off of recent lows, hit in late-March at the height of market panic during the coronavirus outbreak, and is now roughly 10% shy of all-time highs hit in February. 
The whipsawing markets stunted companies' ability to issue new shares and raise cash, with just $4.8 billion sold in March, the lowest monthly total since December 2018, Refinitiv data showed.
The market has rocketed back with $22.3 billion sold in April and $65.3 billion in May, the highest on record.
(GRAPHIC - U.S. public companies sell the rally: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/qzjvqjjxnpx/eikon.png) 
The likes of Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and cruise operator Carnival Corp (N:CCL) have issued new stock to raise money. Major shareholders in companies such as BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and U.S. drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) have cashed out their stock, with the market rebound far from certain to last.
""We're talking to a lot of companies around the fact that the market is here, you don't know what lies in the economy to come,"" said Ryan Parrish, head of Americas equity capital markets syndicate at Bank of America (N:BAC). ""If you even remotely have a need you should get it done now.""
The share sales echo a similar trend in U.S. debt markets, where companies have raised more than $1 trillion so far in 2020.
As in debt markets, the balance of companies selling new shares has shifted from those facing an imminent cash crunch to those stocking up on rainy day funds.
""There are a whole host of companies that have been hugely impacted by COVID-19 and have had to recapitalize,"" said Santosh Sreenivasan, head of equity-linked capital markets for the Americas at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. 

""Issuers that have seen their stock prices recover are now also taking the perspective that they don't want to miss this window in case this rebound is short-lived,"" Sreenivasan said.

Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) was down about 0.5% on the news after ending the day 0.4% higher.
The company said it is encouraging workers to take unpaid leave until September after deciding to keep the seated areas at most of its U.S. cafes closed for the moment, The Wall Street Journal reported.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks posted gains on Monday as signs of U.S. economic recovery helped offset jitters over increasingly violent social unrest amid an ongoing pandemic and rising U.S.-China tensions.
All three major stock indexes began the month with gains of less than 1% on the heels of a strong May rally.
Market leaders  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Amazon.com (O:AMZN) provided the biggest lift to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, while  Boeing Co  (N:BA) gave the Dow its biggest boost.
""Certainly the pace of the stock market recovery can't continue at the pace it has been,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""I'm stunned at how well the market's been doing."" 
The White House called for ""law and order"" after six nights of widespread, violent demonstrations triggered by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police, even as the country reels from the economic effects of pandemic-related lockdowns.
""Most investors are saying (the protests) aren't going to destroy the economy,"" Nolte added. ""It's a roadblock but it's not as big as a pandemic.""
The unrest has prompted retailers such as  Target  Corp (N:TGT) and Walmart Inc (N:WMT) to shutter a portion of their stores, while Amazon.com (O:AMZN) has scaled back deliveries.
Further weighing on sentiment, China ordered state-owned firms to halt purchases of U.S. soybeans and pork, in retaliation for President Donald Trump's announcement that he would end special treatment for Hong Kong following China's move to tighten security measures in the territory.
But economic data boosted investor sentiment, with the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) purchasing managers' index (PMI) showing the contraction of factory activity was slowing.
A fuller picture of the economic damage wrought by pandemic-related lockdowns is expected on Friday, when the Labor Department's jobs report is expected to show unemployment skyrocketing to 19.7%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 91.91 points, or 0.36%, to 25,475.02, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 11.42 points, or 0.38%, to 3,055.73 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 62.18 points, or 0.66%, to 9,552.05.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but healthcare (SPXHC) ended the session in positive territory.
 Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) fell 7.1% after the drugmaker's breast cancer treatment was deemed unlikely to meet the main goal of a late-stage study.
 Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD) slid 3.4% following mixed results in a late-stage study of its COVID-19 drug candidate, remdesivir.
Meanwhile, rivals firms CTI Biopharma Corp (O:CTIC) and  Proteostasis Therapeutics Inc  (O:PTI) advanced 16.7% and 8.4%, respectively following reports that their potential COVID-19 treatments showed promise.
Shares in cosmetics company  Coty Inc  (N:COTY) jumped 20.9% after the appointment of Chairman Peter Harf as its new chief executive officer. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.58-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 10 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.95 billion shares, compared with the 11.30 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 04:35PM ET</span>",Canada to fast-track C$2.2 billion for infrastructure to cash-strapped municipalities,"By Kelsey Johnson and Steve Scherer
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's cash-strapped municipalities will receive C$2.2 billion ($1.62 billion) in fast-tracked federal infrastructure funding to help cover funding shortfalls in budgets battered during the COVID-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday. 
The one-time payment will be delivered in June through the federal Gas Tax Fund, Trudeau told his daily press briefing. As of Monday, Canada had 91,351 cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease cause by the novel coronavirus, and had reported 7,305 deaths, according to official data.
Municipalities will have flexibility to use the funding to meet local needs, including for projects like boosting access to high-speed broadband or improving roads and water systems, Trudeau said.
""From testing clinics to programs for seniors, cities and towns provide essential services, so it's crucial that they have the resources they need,"" he told reporters. 
The Federation of Canadian Municipalities, a national lobby group, asked the federal government in April for C$10 billion to $15 billion in emergency funding over the next six months to help cover revenue drops and added costs from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Asked about that request, Trudeau told reporters the C$2.2 billion in funding was ""a start"" and the federal government was working with the provinces to find more ways to help.
Many municipalities in Canada have deferred property taxes to help residents whose finances were hard hit by the crisis, and their other sources of revenue have declined during the lockdown.
British Columbia, Canada's westernmost province, said on Monday that it would halt evictions due to unpaid rent for businesses eligible for the federal rent relief program but whose landlords had failed to apply.
The move comes as the province reopens its economy, and will ""(put) small businesses in the best position we can to come back and participate in the restart,"" Carole James, the province's finance minister, said.

Investing.com - Stocks managed cautious gains on Wall Street as economic data showed some improvement and reopening optimism remained.
But that was tempered by the civil unrest in cities across the country, and fears that mass protests could lead to a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The possibility of conflict remains tonight, with the president calling for tougher action from state authorities.
On the earnings calendar is one company that was a big winner from lockdown measures. There will also be oil stockpile data.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Curfews in Force
Investors will be keeping an eye on stock index futures as major U.S. cities enact curfews with more expected to protest.
President Donald Trump, on a call to governors, demanded tougher action against protestors and any looting or rioting, saying authorities should “dominate”.
A 7:00 PM ET (23:00 GMT) curfew is in effect for Washington, D.C. On the call, Trump said he would “clamp down” on protests in the nation’s capital and “do something people haven’t seen before”.
Attorney General Bill Barr has reportedly ordered the Bureau of Prisons to send riot control teams to Washington and Miami.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced there would be a curfew in New York City tonight starting at 11 PM ET.
2. Zoom Earnings in View
 Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) became synonymous with working under lockdown restrictions for the Covid-19 pandemic.
Expectations for the company are high after the bulls pushed the stock up about 200% year to date, topping $200 per share today.
Zoom is set to report earnings after the bell tomorrow.
Analysts expect the company to report a quarterly profit of 9 cents per share on revenue of about $202 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Last month Citi initiated coverage of the stock with a neutral rating and a price target of $186, saying sentiment could challenge the recent excitement on the stock as it trades at a “meaningful premium”.
On Friday, Zoom said it plans to strengthen its encryption of video calls of paying clients and institutions, Reuters reported.
3. API Inventories on Tap
Oil prices got some support from OPEC today, finishing little changed, with reports that an extension of production cuts could be coming as the cartel moved up its meeting to June 4.
Tomorrow the American Petroleum Institute will issue its measure of U.S. oil inventories after the bell.
Last week the API reported that crude stockpiles climbed by 8.7 million barrels, bucking the downward trend the market was predicting."

Investing.com - The Dow ended higher on Monday, shrugging off civil unrest across several cities in the U.S. that threatens efforts to reopen the economy.
Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.39%, or 100 points, the S&P 500 gained 0.42%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.65%.
Investors continued to bet that efforts to lift restrictions will spark a faster economic recovery in the back half of the year, even as protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week threaten to slow reopening efforts.
Retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Target  (NYSE:TGT), and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) were forced to shutter stores over the weekend amid damage from the protests.
With optimism over a quicker economic recovery running high, cyclical sectors like financials and real estate continued to rack up gains. 
Real estate was among the biggest gainers, led by  Vornado Realty  Trust (NYSE:VNO), Regency Centers (NASDAQ:REG) and  Kimco Realty  (NYSE:KIM), with the latter up more than 7% after JPMorgan upped its price target on the stock to $13 from $11.
Elswhere, healthcare proved the exception to the gains on Wall Street, paced by a 7% decline in  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) after the pharmaceutical giant revealed disappointing data from its breast-cancer drug trial.
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) slipped 3% after mixed clinical trial results for patients taking its Covid-19 drug remdesivir stoked uncertainty over the efficacy of the treatment.
Patients with moderate disease - those hospitalized but not in need mechanical ventilation at any time - who received the drug for five days were 65% more likely to demonstrate clinical improvement, but those taking the drug for 10 days did not report a statistically significant improvement.   
On the economic front, investors embraced signs of steadying manufacturing activity as the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index for May rose to a reading of 43.1 from 41.5 in April.
The ISM index will ""probably improve materially in June"" as factories begin to reopen and as Boeing (NYSE:BA) resumes production of the 737 MAX, but a return to pre-Covid-19 levels remains some way off, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Tech some pared gains to end roughly flat as chip stocks wobbled after China reportedly ordered companies to temporarily halt imports of some U.S. farm goods. Reuters later reported that China had made orders for U.S. soybeans.

879,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>",Trump Faces Drag of Job Losses Topping 16% in Vital 2020 States,"(Bloomberg) -- Heavy job losses are expected to persist through 2020 and into next year in some of America’s biggest swing states, providing a crucial challenge for President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign.
States that depend on tourism and manufacturing are suffering some of the worst employment declines since the Covid-19 pandemic took hold in March -- among them battleground states including Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Nevada. Job losses of 16% or more are expected to linger at least into the first quarter of 2021, with travel-dependent Nevada leading the nation with a 21% drop, according to research firm IHS Markit.
The study ranks all 50 U.S. states based on multiple criteria including primary industries, population densities and pace of reopenings.
The data suggest Trump faces a major hurdle in pushing an economic message amid the highest unemployment rates in decades.
“Obviously, it’s going to fuel Democrats’ campaign against him on the basis of the economy,” said Susan MacManus, a former professor of political science at the University of South Florida in Tampa. “Any data that’s seen as negative toward the president will be quickly used by Florida Democrats in ads against him.”
Trump’s presumptive Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, is already polling ahead in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida.
Aside from tourist-heavy Florida, the South and the Plains states are expected to fare better in employment than regions hit harder by the virus, such as the Northeast, or areas dependent on manufacturing, such as the Midwest. That’s partly because they have less-dense populations and, in the Plains states, generally don’t rely much on tourism, said IHS regional economist Karl Kuykendall.
That could help Trump in other states believed to be in play, including North Carolina, Texas and Georgia.
IHS Markit sees national pre-pandemic employment levels returning in 2024.
Washington, D.C., with its heavy base of government jobs, actually fares the best in IHS Markit’s study, with employment expected to be down 12.6% in the first quarter of next year. Other states with predicted job losses below 13% are South Dakota, Vermont and Maine.
States faring the worst are Nevada, Massachusetts and Michigan, with employment declines of 17% or more forecast through early next year. Florida, perhaps the most crucial swing state, ranks fourth-worst in the study, with employment projected down 16.8%.
Kuykendall doesn’t see states that lifted their stay-at-home orders earliest as having a huge advantage over states that took longer.
“It is a factor, but I wouldn’t say that even in states that reopened earlier, you wouldn’t expect to see a sudden spike in economic activity,” Kuykendall said. “It’s going to be a slow recovery.”

Last month, the company said that it had obtained preliminary approval to seek bankruptcy protection in order to restructure its operations as the COVID-19 pandemic causes prolonged store closures.
Reitmans, which retails fashion apparel through 576 stores across Canada and online, said it would open all its physical stores in the coming days and weeks, in accordance with government guidelines. 
The retailer said all of its 77 Addition Elle and 54 Thyme Maternity stores will also be open with an objective of liquidating inventory and permanently closing the brands over the course of summer. 
Its workforce reduction would include about 1,100 retail employees and about 300 employees at its Montreal head office, the company said. Reitmans had about 6,800 employees in total.
Other retailers such as U.S.-based J.C. Penney Co Inc, luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus Group and clothing retailer J. Crew Group Inc, have also filed for bankruptcy in the past few weeks.

883,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>",Boris Johnson Revamps Agenda to Meet Worst U.K. Recession in 300 Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson plans to re-set his government’s agenda with a major speech and a financial statement to prepare the U.K. for the new reality after the coronavirus pandemic.
Amid forecasts of the worst recession in 300 years, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is drawing up options to bolster the economy after the government withdraws its vast package of financial support in the months ahead, according to people familiar with the matter.
For Johnson, the priority will be to focus on reasserting his broader political mission in the age of the virus, one person said. The Conservative Party leader and public face of Brexit, Johnson was elected with a large majority just six months ago on a promise to “level up” the forgotten parts of the country.
Yet his plans have been derailed by the global pandemic, with his government’s agenda put on ice as the coronavirus crisis took over. Work has begun on preparing for a key speech, expected at the end of June, one person said.
On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised more details on the “economic response” later this summer after he was asked about government preparations for a recession amid fears of bankruptcies and job losses.
“The economy’s going to have to change,” Hancock told the government’s daily virus briefing in London. “We’re going to have to be a different type of economy as we come out of this and you’re going to hear more of that from the chancellor and the prime minister, who’ve been working so hard on this, in the weeks and months to come.”
Officials privately confirmed work is under way on a fiscal event but said it is too early to be precise about the detailed policy proposals, or about the date, though one person said it is likely to be in July.
Among the questions that have been discussed among Johnson’s allies include whether there is potential to raise income tax or national insurance specifically to pay for investment in the National Health Service. Business taxes may also rise, as internal polling suggests there is public support for increases in corporation tax.
Other options could include a windfall tax on sectors that have profited during the pandemic -- such as supermarkets or technology companies, one person familiar with discussions said.

Last week, the District Court in The Hague granted an injunction filed by Impossible Foods to prevent Nestle from marketing its burgers as ""Incredible"" after arguing that the signage bore a strong visual, phonetic and conceptual resemblance to the U.S. company's EU trademark and could confuse consumers.
In its ruling, the court agreed that Nestle had infringed Impossible Foods' trademarks and prohibited the KitKat-maker from using the ""Incredible"" name throughout Europe, giving it four weeks to withdraw its products from shelves or face 25,000 euros ($27,772.50) a day in fines. 
""We are disappointed by this provisional ruling as it is our belief that anyone should be able to use descriptive terms such as 'incredible' that explain the qualities of a product. We will of course abide by this decision, but in parallel, we will file an appeal,"" Nestle wrote in an email. 
The company said it would now re-brand its plant-based burgers to ""Sensational Burgers"", saying the new name evoked ""the senses that are stimulated by our burger."" 
The ruling comes at a time when Impossible Foods is working hard to enter into Europe. 
In October, the company filed with the European Food Safety Authority to market soy leghemoglobin, a genetically modified ingredient, that is key in making its Impossible burgers bleed like their animal counterparts.

But the process for approval has taken long as the EU has a comprehensive and a strict legal regime on genetically modified food, with each product undergoing strict evaluation and safety assessment tests that usually take months.

BANGALORE/DENVER (Reuters) - Hedge fund Angelo Gordon & Co aims to raise as much as $1.5 billion to buy the debt of distressed oil and gas companies, according to a person familiar with the matter and an investor presentation viewed by Reuters.
The U.S. shale boom, financed by access to cheap capital, is drying up as weak oil and gas prices and investors' reluctance to refinance debt has companies cutting production and some seeking protection from creditors. U.S. output is expected to fall as much as 2 million barrels per day this year. 
The Angelo Gordon fund will be called AG Energy Credit Opportunities Fund IV LP and will seek to acquire distressed debt in the oil exploration and production, pipeline and services sectors, according to a presentation seen by Reuters.
Todd Dittmann, head of energy at the $38 billion company, will manage the fund, which will pursue senior secured loans and discounted reserve based loans, the presentation showed.
Dittmann and an Angelo Gordon spokeswoman declined to comment.
If Angelo Gordon completes the fundraising, it would be the firm's second this year to target the debt of struggling companies. In February, it completed a $1.8 billion fund raising that had its initial closing in July 2019. [https://tinyurl.com/yayhvmtz]

886,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",JPMorgan’s Math Shows Why U.S. Stocks Can Keep Rallying,"(Bloomberg) -- Think the sizzling U.S. stock rally is excessive in an economy frozen by shutdowns? From one perspective, it’s just getting started.
Giant piles of cash sloshing around the financial system means there’s substantial ammunition yet to push risk assets higher. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., meanwhile, sees potential for billions to flow into equities at the expense of bonds to rebalance portfolios. Money-market funds have lured $1.2 trillion this year, while fund managers with $591 billion overall are holding cash at levels rarely seen in history, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
All that shows how much firepower investors have to support the market at a time when stock prices look unhinged from fundamentals like corporate profits, and trade frictions between China and the U.S. return to the forefront.
“Investors are still underweight equities and signs of overextension are confined to momentum traders,” JPMorgan strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note. “There is still plenty of room for investors to raise their equity allocations.”
JPMorgan says the equity allocation of non-bank investors -- a group that includes households, pensions, endowments and sovereign wealth funds -- will probably rise to 49% in the coming years, given the backdrop of low interest rates and high liquidity. Currently, the proportion is 40%.
Just ask John Roe, the head of multi-asset funds at Legal & General Investment Management. He started buying more shares recently after finding few opportunities in credit. The investor sees a self-reinforcing rally as higher prices draw more buying and positioning, but he’s having to look past his concerns that the pandemic will causing lasting damage to the economy.
“Equities have reached a range where we worry about self-reinforcing momentum,” Roe said. “It’s very tough when we are fundamentally negative and think the scarring risks are under-appreciated.”
Another sign of cautious sentiment: investors are deeply short the market, so there’s potential for stocks to rally when they cover their positions.
Speculators have built up the largest net short position on S&P 500 futures since late 2015, according to regulatory data. Short interest in the world’s largest exchange-traded fund -- which tracks the U.S. stock benchmark -- is also still hovering close to its peak in March, according to Markit data.
Among retail investors and the like, risk appetite may be returning gradually.
U.S. stocks and credit funds recorded stronger inflows in the week through Wednesday, according to EPFR Global data cited by Bank of America. At the same time, flows into money funds slowed and government bond funds saw redemptions for the first time in six weeks.
As the bank’s strategists led by Michael Hartnett put it succinctly: “Positioning still bearish, policy bullish.”
So who’s buying? Certain breeds of quants, for one. Momentum traders, like commodity trading advisers, are the only overextended part of Wall Street, according to JPMorgan.
By its estimates, the momentum signal for U.S. stocks has returned to elevated levels. The last time the overbought signal was this stretched was near the beginning of this year, just before stocks plummeted. Even so, profit-taking by momentum investors is unlikely to derail the bull market, JPMorgan strategists said, given low equity allocation by other kinds of investors.
As for other quant investors, Nomura Securities projects that U.S. volatility-control funds -- which target a particular level of price swings -- are finally piling into stocks again as the market calms. Their estimated equity exposure remains around the second percentile in data going back to 2010, meaning that it was lower just 2% of the time, strategist Charlie McElligot wrote in a note.
In sum, with the S&P 500 trading at a two-decade high versus the coming year’s earnings, stocks might look pricey. But few investors have actually poured their cash in.

887,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court rebuffs investors' bid to block Madoff trustee lawsuits,"By Andrew Chung
(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a bid by major banks and companies including Koch Industries Inc to prevent a trustee chasing money for victims of imprisoned Ponzi scheme swindler Bernard Madoff from recouping funds that were transferred overseas. 
The justices left in place a lower court's ruling that revived dozens of lawsuits filed by Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Madoff's firm, aimed at recovering the foreign transfers. The defendants in the litigation had said the ruling improperly extended the reach of U.S. bankruptcy law beyond the country's borders.
The Manhattan-based the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had overturned a bankruptcy judge's decision to dismiss the lawsuits. President Donald Trump's administration agreed with the 2nd Circuit ruling.
The dispute is part of Picard's 11-year search for tainted money stemming from the largest Ponzi scheme in history, which Madoff orchestrated through his New York firm, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. The trustee has estimated that Madoff's customers lost $17.5 billion in the fraud.
Madoff, 82, was arrested in 2008 and pleaded guilty in 2009. He is serving a 150-year sentence in North Carolina. Madoff, whose lawyer has said is dying of kidney failure, has sought ""compassionate release,"" saying he had fewer than 18 months to live.
The case centers on 88 lawsuits filed against Koch, controlled by the billionaire Charles Koch,  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), UBS AG and other entities accused of receiving Madoff-linked money indirectly through offshore feeder funds that had directly invested with Madoff. 
Picard contends about $3 billion was fraudulently transferred outside the United States, taking into account his settlement with the British Virgin Islands-based Kingate feeder funds. 

The trustee sued Koch, a privately held industrial conglomerate based in Kansas, in 2012 to recoup $21.5 million Madoff was accused of sending to another British Virgin Islands-based feeder fund and then to a Koch entity in Britain. Koch was not accused of wrongdoing.

""It's not just leisure travel growing, but it is business travel. Chinese are flying again,"" Sorenson said at a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) conference.
In the United States, Marriott's hotels that remained open crossed the 20% occupancy threshold and continue to see an improvement, Sorenson said.

The company had an occupancy rate of about 12% in North America in April, with 16% of its hotels closed temporarily.

Investing.com – Sterling surged to a near one-month high against the dollar on Monday, but some have called for caution amid fears the U.K. and EU are unlikely to make progress on upcoming trade talks.
GBP/USD rose 1.08% to $1.2477 to its highest since May. 5.
The next round of Brexit talks are set for Tuesday, but there is ""little to suggest we should expect any real progress, and that's one reason why we've seen some risk premium creep back into the pound,"" ING said in a note.
With time running out for the U.K. and EU to agree an extension to the transition period by the June 30 deadline, the surge in sterling is likely on borrowed time. ""The fading prospect of an extension to the post-Brexit transition period, and the risk of supply chain disruption at the start of 2021, casts a cloud over the GBP outlook,"" ING added.
Without an extension to the trade talks, the U.K. will have until the end of the year to agree a trade deal with the EU, or risk a no-deal exit, a scenario that many have warned could have dire consequences on economic growth at a time when the economy is reeling from the Covid-19 impact.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Aerolineas Argentinas will begin negotiations with unions to suspend the contracts of thousands of employees until August after the flag carrier's income plunged about 97% due to the coronavirus outbreak, it said on Monday.
The airline, which is staying afloat largely through state support, will pay workers' social security and make smaller, spot payments during the proposed two-month suspension, it said in a statement.
A source told Reuters the carrier aims to suspend some 8,000 of its 12,000 employees.
Savings from the suspension would be used to maintain the fleet, make repairs and shore up its spare parts supply chain, the company said.
""The health crisis that the world is going through is an unprecedented event that led to the biggest crisis in the commercial airline sector in history.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets hovered near three-month highs and safe-haven government bonds inched lower as risk appetite grew on signs that the global economic downturn has bottomed, despite worries over violent protests in the United States and unease over Washington's standoff with Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump left a trade deal with China intact Friday despite moving to end Washington's special treatment for Hong Kong in retaliation for Beijing seeking to impose new security legislation on the city.
China has asked state-owned firms to halt purchases of soybeans and pork from the United States in response, two people familiar with the matter said.
""The Trump rhetoric against China and trade impediments against Hong Kong could have been a lot worse, hence the performance of those markets this morning, which has helped the risk backdrop,"" said Chris Bailey, European strategist at wealth manager Raymond James.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s gauge of stocks across the globe (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.78% following broad gains in Asia and Europe. The index (MIWD00000PUS) is up more than 35% from its March lows. 
In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 60.07 points, or 0.24%, to 25,443.18, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 6.13 points, or 0.20%, to 3,050.44 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 37.43 points, or 0.39%, to 9,527.31.
Signs of a rebound from the global coronavirus lockdown helped bolster global equities and push safe haven assets lower. France's manufacturing activity rose in May as the country began to emerge from a nearly two-month coronavirus lockdown, pulling the sector out of a nosedive that had seen activity hit a record low a month earlier, a survey released on Monday showed.
An official business survey from China showed its factory activity grew at a slower pace in May but momentum in the services and construction sectors quickened. 
U.S. manufacturing activity eased off an 11-year low in May, though a full recovery from the COVID-19 crisis could take years because of high unemployment.
Benchmark 10-year notes (US10YT=RR) last fell 10/32 in price to yield 0.677%, from 0.644% late on Friday. 
Bond investors suspect economies will need massive amounts of central bank support long after they reopen and that is keeping yields super low even as governments borrow much more.
""Current unemployment numbers go far beyond what has been experienced in any post-war recession,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) economist Christian Keller wrote in a note. ""To the extent that some sectors may never return to pre-pandemic business-as-usual.""
A weekend of violent U.S. protests over race and policing could present another setback for the economy which was only just emerging from the steepest downturn since the Great Depression. 
Following poor data on spending and trade out on Friday, the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated economic output could drop a staggering 51% annualized in the second quarter.
The May jobs report due out on Friday is forecast to show the unemployment rate surged to 19.8%, smashing April's record 14.7%. Payrolls are expected to drop by 7.4 million, on top of the 20.5 million jobs lost the previous month.

892,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",Protests Hammer U.S. Cities Still Recovering From Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) -- The reopening of America was always going to be fraught, with competing fears of new virus outbreaks and economic meltdown. Now cities across the nation, from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles, are reeling from unrest that could worsen both.
Violence erupted in dozens of cities following the death of George Floyd, a black Minneapolis man who died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for more than eight minutes. Some demonstrators broke off to rampage through shopping districts, including Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills and Michigan Avenue in Chicago, and set fire to police cars and municipal buildings.
In a teleconference with governors and law enforcement Monday, President Donald Trump urged states to crack down on protests and arrest people. “You have to dominate,” Trump told them. “If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.”
The chaos, amid otherwise peaceful protests, struck as the economy struggles to emerge from its coronavirus-enforced hibernation. After the Covid-19 deaths of more than 104,000 Americans, unprecedented government intervention and massive disruptions to business and everyday life, the scenes of unrest were a bleak contrast to the recent optimism of the markets. A 36% rally in the S&P 500 since March has pushed valuations to the highest in 20 years.
“I think people are coming to the realization that their jobs may not be coming back or coming back quickly. This is all conflating with the racial tensions and completely boiling over,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “This highlights the depth of despair in America,” he added, citing 20% unemployment and 50 million workers who’ve lost their jobs or had pay cuts.
The unrest cast doubt on the partial reopening of businesses that Chicago planned for Wednesday. Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who imposed a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew on the city, restricted access to the downtown area to those who work or live there, and essential workers. At Lightfoot’s request, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is sending 375 National Guard soldiers to the city.
Lightfoot said the violence had forced the city to consider postponing the reopening of the businesses, which have been closed for 10 weeks. “To see their hard work and their money and resources literally go up in flame, their property reduced to kindling, that’s heartbreaking,” she said.
The violence prompted Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). to scale back deliveries and shut down delivery stations in a handful of cities including Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland.  Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT), which had already shuttered 32 stores around its Minneapolis headquarters, said it was closing dozens more around the nation, at least temporarily.
 Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ)., which has more than 1,000 stores in the U.S., said it’s working with state and local officials on store closing to protect employees and customers. On a companywide webcast Monday, CEO Hans Vestberg pledged $10 million to seven charities including the NAACP that work on causes like racial inequality and social injustice.
“The events unfolding across the country that are rooted in hate are contradictory with our beliefs as a company,” Vestberg said in the video.
Wireless carrier T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) Inc., which operates Metro and Sprint stores, says it has closed hundreds of retail locations, particularly in cities where demonstrations have turned fierce. “As conditions and local curfews allow, we will begin assessing impacts, repairing damage and reopening stores as quickly as we can,” a T-Mobile representative said in a statement.
The scenes of burning cars, looting, and violent arrests by baton-wielding police could reverse gains that business owners were making to lure back customers already concerned about going out in public.
After spiking in mid-March, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’ new Social Distancing Index, which measures the extent of physical distancing and its relationship to economic activity, had started to decline once U.S. states began lifting restrictions on business and consumer interactions.
Cities hammered by major budget hits from the pandemic can hardly afford the extra costs of police overtime, security measures and damages from the protests. Even before the demonstrations, the Fed and Trump administration have been under mounting pressure to do more for states and municipalities.
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) activists have questioned municipalities’ financial support for police departments as other services are cut.
Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Sunday she was concerned the protests could spark another increase in coronavirus cases in a city that started the first phase of its reopening on May 29.
“We saw a mass gathering, basically -- we’ve been working hard for the last eight, 10 weeks on not having any mass gatherings,” Bowser said.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio raised similar concerns about a possible rise in virus cases because of the proximity of people at protests, which he called “inherently dangerous.” The city still has not met its threshold for available hospital beds to qualify for its scheduled June 8 reopening.
De Blasio said the violence wouldn’t delay the city’s plan to restart its construction, manufacturing, wholesale and curbside retail businesses. But the costs of policing the city during days of protests must be added to a budget already under stress from the lockdown’s economic costs.
“We certainly have had to employ a lot of resources for a few days and I think it could potentially go on a few more days. But I don’t think it will go on forever,” he said during a news briefing. “In terms of impact on our restart, I don’t see one. In terms of impact on our budget – something but nothing profound.”
Amazon Deliveries
The unrest has dented the supply lines feeding the U.S. economy. Amazon delivery drivers in Chicago and Los Angeles received messages Saturday night that said: “If you are currently out delivering packages, stop immediately and return home. If you have not completed your route, please return undelivered packages to the pick-up location whenever you’re able to do so.”
The fury over Floyd’s death comes as black Americans are dealing with a disproportionately heavy impact on their health and finances from the virus. In New York City, African-Americans have a higher rate of infection than other races, according to city data. A McKinsey & Co. report found that 39% of jobs held by black Americans are at risk from furloughs or layoffs due to the shutdowns meant to curb the spread of the pandemic.
Del Shea Perry, who filed a lawsuit alleging her son died in a Minnesota jail after getting inadequate medical care, spoke at a protest in St. Paul, Minnesota, on Sunday. She said she doesn’t condone the looting, but it reflects building frustration in the community over the deaths of black men like her son and Floyd. “Why must we fight like this to get justice?” she said.
People have stepped in to aid businesses affected by the protests in Minneapolis, with hundreds of residents joining the cleanup effort. More than $800,000 was raised on GoFundMe to help rebuild Scores Sports Bar, which delayed its opening during the pandemic only to be destroyed in the protests.
In Chicago, the South Loop neighborhood was one of the hardest hit areas. The long list of businesses hit by looting or vandalism included Trader Joe’s, Kasey’s Tavern, which holds the city’s second oldest liquor license, pet store Kriser’s Natural Pet, Bulldog Ale House and a knitting shop.
Many residents on Sunday morning took to the streets to help sweep sidewalks of broken glass from looted businesses.
“So many people have stopped by to buy brooms,” Mike Wiese, manager at Gordon’s Ace Hardware, said. The store’s cash registers were too damaged overnight to do any transactions, so he’s been giving the brooms away and asking people to come back later to pay.
By Sunday afternoon, similar efforts were underway in Los Angeles. Scores of young people, many of whom had been protesting the day before, were cleaning up graffiti and sweeping streets. Many structures, including an iconic tower at the Original Farmers Market in the Fairfax district, had already been painted clean.
Los Angeles hotel owners Peter and Ellen Picataggio boarded up the windows of their Farmer’s Daughter hotel in the Fairfax district before the neighborhood erupted in violence Saturday night with stores looted nearby. Fortunately for the Picataggios, their damage was limited to a stolen fire extinguisher and graffiti tagged on the plywood.
Reservations had just begun to pick up after a lockdown had limited hotel bookings to as few as one or two a night. He thinks the recovery will still come.
“Do I think this will impact it?,” Peter Picataggio said. “No, I think it will be a blip. If it ends here, I don’t think there will be a long term impact.”
Heather Johnson, a buyer for a shoe shop, works with the owner of Shiekh Shoes, a family-owned store that started in the Bay Area. On Saturday, thieves stole all of the merchandise and damaged the fittings on the walls.
“I don’t know how we’re going to bring the store back to life,” she said. “It’s going to be really, really hard.”

897,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",The Buy-Side Trader Is Getting Outsourced in Coronavirus Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- A once-in-century disruption to securities trading is intensifying a revolution in how some investment firms conduct business.
With at-home traders navigating the wildest market swings in history, more money managers are tapping outsourcing companies to buy and sell financial assets on their behalf. With their employees at risk of falling sick or losing regular access to market venues, the buy side in lockdown is turning to a booming industry that’s drawing big-gun entrants including  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT)., AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) Holding LP and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
In so doing, the largest providers are reporting a surge in revenues as transaction volumes jump and new clients sign up.
Outsourced traders essentially act as a middleman between the buy side and sell side in handling trading flows. Some outsourced trading divisions are run inside bigger financial services firms, like Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc., while others operate as small, standalone shops. Their pitch to asset managers: Ensuring best execution with an extensive network of brokerages and high-speed technology, which can be expensive for smaller funds to maintain on their own.
“We’ve seen folks add our outsourced trading team just to be able to say that they have systems in place and a set-up in place should their traders get sick with Covid,” said Bobby Croswell, head of U.S. outsourced trading at Cowen Inc. The firm’s outsourcing revenue more than doubled in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2019.
As the pandemic unleashes unprecedented operational risks, asset managers are joining peers who have flocked to these services in recent years to keep up with new technologies and to cut costs -- while liquidity gets ever-more fragmented.
Among the more established names, Outset Global LLP says its client list has grown 45% in the year through April. Tora Trading Services Ltd. says sales increased 105% in the first three months of the year from the prior period, as existing clients expanded usage and new ones signed on. Tourmaline Partners LLC, an outsourcing firm based in Stamford, Connecticut, just clinched a majority investment from a private equity firm that will help expansion plans.

While some smaller funds opt to outsource entirely, many larger managers use such services to supplement their own operations, like buying and selling Asian stocks when their traders in New York are asleep.
Unlike agency or prime broking, outsourced players conduct relationships with the sell side on behalf of the client and offer more comprehensive services including monitoring exposures and providing market color.
“It does appear there has been increased interest in outsourced trading,” said Shane Swanson, an analyst at consultancy Greenwich Associates. “That does go hand-in-hand with the explosion in technology we’ve seen across the past 10, 15 years -- in particular in how that has been utilized as part of this response to the Covid crisis.”
He calls the recent turmoil a “proof of concept” for outsourcing for a host of new managers.
In a sign of the growing demand, larger financial firms including Cantor Fitzgerald LP and Jefferies have expanded their industry offerings over the past year.
Octavio Marenzi, co-founder of consultancy Opimas, suspects that the boom will ease as the buy side adapts to working from home, but the long-term pressure to cut costs is still in favor of the business. Opimas has estimated that a fifth of investment managers overseeing more than $50 billion will outsource at least parts of their trading by 2022.
“Global equity trading is a bit like a melting ice cube; it’s structurally challenged and will remain that way,” said Raymond McCabe, the London-based founder of Outset Global. “To have your own trader depending on what size you are or how you trade is, for some, a luxury.”

899,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>",Mortgage Sector Off to Worst Start Since 2013 Despite Fed Help,"(Bloomberg) -- Mortgage investors have yet to enjoy robust returns this year despite the Federal Reserve providing $688 billion of support to the sector since mid-March.
The year-to-date excess return versus Treasuries for the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. MBS Index stands at -0.31% as of Friday, the worst seen over a similar period since 2013, which was also a time of central bank mortgage purchases.
After an excess return of +0.48% in April -- with the help of $295 billion in Fed support -- last month’s $101 million in central bank buying was barely enough to fog the performance mirror, resulting in a tepid 0.03% excess return.
Several factors have kept investors wary of the sector.
First off are the surprisingly robust prepayment speed reports over the past two months, which proved that lockdown or not, when it comes to the chance of lowering their monthly mortgage payments (and for lenders to make fees for refinancings) Americans are nothing if not persistent. The April prepayment report saw aggregate conventional Fannie Mae 30-year speeds rise 26%, following the previous month’s 42% increase.
While May prepayment speeds (to be released Thursday afternoon) are expected to drop between 10% to 15%, Nomura MBS analysts wrote in a recent report that they have long-term concerns about “the risk of rising prepayments” with mortgages rates at record lows.
A second factor is the wave of forbearance after recent legislation that allowed homeowners to demand it on easy terms. As of May 17, servicers have seen 8.36% of their loans drop into forbearance, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
The question is how many of those loans will eventually default and require buyouts, an event that can hurt mortgage sector performance. Unfortunately, the root cause of the forbearance spike is a lockdown-driven slump in nationwide economic activity -- which is unprecedented and therefore not quantifiable.
Most concerning for valuations is an issue put best by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) in their latest research report. “Our survey responders flag the Fed as the overriding driver of value and risk,” and the risk they’re referring to is “a taper tantrum repeat that looms large beyond 2020.”
The “taper tantrum” was sparked by comments from former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on May 22, 2013 about the potential for reduced central bank support for mortgages. In the two weeks that followed, the mortgage sector’s excess return dropped 0.73%. By July of that year, 30-year mortgage rates had increased to 4.51% from 3.59%.
That reaction highlights that any sector supported by a central bank, by necessity, becomes dependent on that bank’s continued largess to maintain its current valuations. Having benefited from almost $700 billion in Fed credit since mid-March, it’s arguable that mortgage sector performance going forward will depend most heavily on decisions made by the Federal Reserve Board.

LONDON (Reuters) - The world's 12 biggest investment banks cashed in on commodity price volatility caused by the coronavirus in the first quarter, with big increases in income from oil offsetting a tumble in precious metals, consultancy Coalition said.
The banks' net revenue from trading, selling derivatives and other activities in the commodities sector was around $1.5 billion over January-March, the financial industry analytics firm said. 
That compares to around $1.2 billion in the same period in 2019, it said.
The first quarter was marked by huge swings in commodities markets as the coronavirus spread across the globe, shutting industry, confining people to their homes and paralyzing supply chains. 
Prices of oil, metals and some other key commodities slumped, while gold prices in London and New York, the two main bullion trading centers, saw their biggest divergence in decades. [O/R] [METL/]
Investment banks are often able to profit from volatility because it can make clients more active and they can bet on prices moving in a certain direction. 
The 12 banks did best in oil, with net revenue almost doubling from the first quarter of 2019 to around $700 million, Coalition research director Amrit Shahani said. 
Precious metals revenues, however, plunged to less than $100 million from close to $250 million a year ago, he said. 
What had been a very profitable quarter was hammered in late March when prices of New York futures rose sharply above London rates and the value of banks' positions across the two markets fell sharply, Shahani said. 
Banks' revenues from commodities increased in 2018 and 2019 after a decade of decline since the global financial crisis as heightened government regulation and poor performance made them shrink their commodities businesses.
The 12 banks Coalition tracks for its quarterly reports are Bank of America Merrill Lynch (N:BAC),  Barclays  (L:BARC),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP),  Citigroup  (N:C),  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (N:GS), HSBC (L:HSBA), JPMorgan (N:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) and UBS (S:UBSG).

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld appointments to Puerto Rico's federally created financial oversight board that had been challenged by creditors in a ruling that avoids disruption to the panel's restructuring of about $120 billion of the bankrupt U.S. territory's debt.
The justices, in a 9-0 decision authored by Justice Stephen Breyer, concluded that the 2016 appointment of seven board members did not violate the U.S. Constitution's so-called appointments clause as the challengers had argued.
The outcome hinged on the court's conclusion that the board has control primarily over local issues, meaning the appointments were valid under the Constitution's language regarding naming officials to certain government posts.
The board appealed after the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that the appointments were unlawful because the members had not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
The legal challenge was brought in 2017 by Puerto Rico creditors including Aurelius Investment, LLC, a hedge fund that holds Puerto Rico bonds, and Unión de Trabajadores de la Industria Eléctrica y Riego, Inc, a labor group that represents workers at Puerto Rico's government-owned electricity utility.
Bondholders face losses as a result of debt restructuring while the labor group has said the board's proposed restructuring of the utility's debt would lead to its members having worse working conditions.
Congress created the board in 2016 to address the Caribbean island territory's fiscal crisis. 
The board, which has paused the restructuring of debt during the coronavirus pandemic, welcomed the ruling, saying in a statement it is ""steadily working towards instituting long-term fiscal planning and balanced budgeting."" 

The board already faces another legal battle. Last week, bond insurer  Ambac Financial Group Inc  (N:AMBC) filed a lawsuit claiming that provisions in the 2016 law that allowed for the island's 2017 bankruptcy filing are unconstitutional.

903,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",The U.S. Gets Serious About Catching Up to China in R&D,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For a few years now, commentators (including myself) have been calling for a big boost in research spending by the U.S. federal government. In their book “Jump-Starting America: How Breakthrough Science Can Revive Economic Growth and the American Dream,” economists Jonathan Gruber and Simon Johnson called for devoting $100 billion a year to develop a network of new research centers around the country. A team at the Brookings Institution came up with a more modest but still substantial plan for $10 billion a year, funneled through universities.
Big ideas like this often tend to languish for years or decades before legislators decide to take a stab at implementing them -- if they ever do. In this era of partisan posturing, that seems especially likely to happen. But amazingly, a bipartisan group of legislators is acting on the idea of major new research spending. The Endless Frontier Act would spend more than  $20 billion a year on upgrading the National Science Foundation, to be renamed the National Science and Technology Foundation, with greatly expanded missions, powers and facilities.
Drawing on plans like those of Brookings and Gruber and Johnson, the agency’s new technology directorate would create a series of research centers, based at existing universities, focusing on 10 key areas of technology. This is a great move because leveraging existing universities will yield much more bang for the buck than trying to build new research parks.
It will also help preserve research universities and the college towns around them. For the past few decades, universities have counted on increasing tuition to fund faculty salaries, graduate-student stipends, new research facilities and other research inputs. But enrollment of high-paying foreign students and state university funding both probably are in long-term decline. So federal funding needs to step in to sustain the research that in turn sustains both U.S. technological leadership and regional economies. One thing that's encouraging is that the Endless Frontier Act also budgets $2 billion a year for creating technology hubs in economically distressed regions (though it’s not clear yet what form those hubs would take).
The new bill also recognizes that simply throwing money at research problems isn’t always the best way to make progress. Many of the key government-funded innovations over the past few decades, including the internet itself, have come from the legendary Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA uses a unique model for organizing research projects: Giving free rein to powerful program directors, pulling in researchers from across different institutions and fields and focusing on specific goals. The technology directorate of the proposed NSTF would have the ability to organize DARPA-like projects in addition to traditional research efforts.
If enacted, the Endless Frontier Act would help revitalize the U.S. economy at the national and regional levels and preserve institutions of higher education. But it has one more important goal: Keeping the U.S. ahead of its new rival China in the emerging technology race. The U.S. cannot maintain its technological lead simply by kneecapping China with export restrictions or by putting a halt to Chinese espionage; it also needs to invest vigorously in its own capabilities, just as China has done. Big investments in research were one of the key ways that the U.S. won the original Cold War against the Soviet Union, and this contest will be no different. Many of the areas of research named in the act are either things China has invested aggressively in or things that would help U.S. industry stay ahead of Chinese competition -- artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, biotechnology and so on.
There are two possible concerns about the plan. First, even with more than $20 billion a year, it isn't enough to restore U.S. technological leadership -- at least, not if the Cold War is any guide. Federal research spending has declined from 1.2% of gross domestic product to only 0.8% since the late 1980s, and $20 billion is only 0.1% of GDP.
Ideally, the Endless Frontier Act will be only the start. The initial spending, although substantial, will actually be a proof of concept that can be scaled up later once the new directorate is created and researchers learn how to put the new flows of money to productive use.
Second, some scientists worry that a greater focus on technology and mission-oriented, DARPA-style research will detract from the NSF’s traditional pursuit of basic research. But this probably isn't something worth agonizing over. The Endless Frontier Act would actually boost the budgets of the NSF’s existing science directorates, which work on basic research and traditional approaches. Investing in applicable technologies and mission-oriented projects is a complement to traditional basic research, not a substitute. In fact, accidental discoveries made by scientists working on applied technologies can even create new directions for fundamental research.
A big push for federal research spending is one of the most obvious things the U.S. government could do to both benefit the U.S. economy and restore U.S. tech dominance. This bipartisan plan is a very encouraging sign that the U.S. isn't content to slip grumpily into decline.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa's (DE:LHAG) supervisory board has approved a 9 billion euro ($10 billion) government bailout that will force the German airline to give some of its prized landing slots to rivals.
The approval marks the latest step in the complex state rescue of Lufthansa, which has been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic's impact on the travel sector.
Under the plans, the German government will take a 20% stake in the airline, which could rise to 25% plus one share in the event of a takeover attempt, as well as two seats on its supervisory board.
Lufthansa will also be obliged to transfer to rivals up to 24 take-off and landing slots at Frankfurt and Munich airports.
""We recommend that our shareholders follow this path, even if it requires them to make substantial contributions to stabilising their company,"" supervisory board Chairman Karl-Ludwig Kley said in a statement.
""It must be clearly stated, however, that Lufthansa is facing a very difficult road ahead.""
The bailout still needs to be approved by regulators and Lufthansa investors, who are due to meet virtually at an extraordinary general meeting on June 25, Lufthansa said, adding that the rescue funds would have to be repaid as soon as possible.
Lufthansa, which said it would publish first-quarter results on June 3, said it is obvious that international air traffic will not bounce back to pre-crisis levels in the foreseeable future.
""The expected slow market recovery in global air traffic makes an adjustment of our capacities unavoidable,"" said Chief Executive Carsten Spohr.
""Among other things, we want to discuss with our collective bargaining and social partners how the impact of this development can be softened in the most socially acceptable way possible.""
Lufthansa's executive board will discuss the necessary measures with the Verdi, Vereinigung Cockpit and UFO unions, it said without elaborating.
Spohr told employees in late April that the carrier expects to operate 100 fewer aircraft with 10,000 fewer staff after the coronavirus crisis ends. The group has roughly 140,000 employees and 760 planes.

906,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","Nissan sees cost of quitting Barcelona at up to $1.7 billion, source says","By Joan Faus
BARCELONA (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) has estimated the closure of its plants in Barcelona could cost up to around 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion), a union source told Reuters on Monday.
The cost of the closure is at the heart of a debate in Spain over the move, with the government saying it would be cheaper to keep the plants operating.
A Nissan spokesman declined to comment. 
The decision to leave Barcelona was announced by the Japanese carmaker last week as part of a turnaround plan, triggering protests by workers and a commitment by Madrid to do all it can to convince the company to stay.
Barcelona-based La Vanguardia newspaper earlier on Monday cited Nissan documents as saying the closures could cost 1.45 billion euros, mostly to make around 3,000 workers redundant.
The union source said that a few weeks ago Nissan had told workers that shutting the three Barcelona facilities could cost around 1.5 billion euros.
On May 28, the day the shutdown was announced, a Nissan executive told workers the cost could be much lower, at 700-800 million euros, the source added.
However, the source, along with another senior union official, said the second estimate was probably unrealistic as that would barely cover redundancy payments to workers, some of whom have been employed for more than 20 years. 
On top of that, Nissan would face other costs related to suppliers and dismantling factories, the first source said, adding: ""1.5 billion euros is more realistic. It's not easy to dismantle a factory.""
La Vanguardia said that among the costs Nissan had estimated were 600 million euros for firing workers, 310 million in fiscal costs and potentially repaying 100 million of public aid.
Nissan believes it would take close to seven years to recover in savings the cost of leaving Barcelona, the newspaper said.

907,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","Global remittances could fall by $100 billion in 2020, says Citi","LONDON (Reuters) - Slower economic growth expectations prompted Citi on Monday to slash its forecasts for global remittances, saying this raised the risk to credit ratings of smaller emerging market countries and was set to push up their borrowing costs.
Remittances could fall by $100 billion in the worse case scenario, Citi said in a note to clients, while more than doubling its base case for the scale of decline to $68 billion in 2020. In mid-April, it had estimated that the amount of wages migrants would send home would shrink by some $28 billion this year.
This would cause the biggest problems for countries with little fiscal space to mitigate the hit from falling remittances, which would increasingly force them to spend larger amounts to prop up their economies. That raises the risk that they become unable to meet all their debt obligations.
""Declines in remittances may have negative implications for the sovereign debt ratings of small EMs (emerging markets),"" Citi's Dana Peterson wrote in a note to clients. 
""Tajikistan and Sri Lanka are both at elevated risk of sovereign default, and have net inbound remittances that are sizable shares of own GDP,"" she added. 
Much of the impact depends on which country and sector immigrants and migrants worked in. Migrant workers in the United States who originally came from Latin America and Asia were at higher risk of job losses, Citi said, and consequently would send less money home.

In April, the World Bank estimated that global remittances were set to tumble by $142 billion in 2020, the sharpest fall in recent history.

The treatment, Ibrance, was being tested along with the standard of care for early breast cancer in men and women, against standard of care alone, the company said on Friday. 
The study was broadly seen to have a high probability of success readout, but the early failure represents a meaningful setback for Pfizer, JP Morgan analysts said in a note, cutting its price target on the stock by $1 to $37.
At least three other brokerages cut their price targets on the stock. 
Ibrance, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for metastatic breast cancer, brought in sales of $4.96 billion in 2019.

Lilly is one of the several drugmakers and research institutions that are working on vaccines, antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading novel coronavirus, which has already killed over 370,000 worldwide.
An antiviral drug from Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) called remdesivir has shown some promise against COVID-19 and is being given to patients by some countries under compassionate or emergency use rule.
Lilly said its early stage study will assess safety and tolerability in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and results are anticipated by the end of June.
The experimental treatment, LY-CoV555, has been developed through collaboration with privately held AbCellera Biologics, which Lilly partnered with in March.
Lilly's treatment is an antibody directed against the spike-shaped protein structures of the virus and is designed to block it from locking on to human cells, thus neutralizing the virus.
The drugmaker said the antibody treatment was developed after it was identified from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients who recovered from the lung illness caused by the new coronavirus.
Lilly said it expects to move into the next phase of testing, studying the potential treatment in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, if the drug is shown to be safe.
Rival Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) Pharmacuticals Inc has said it plans to start clinical studies in June to test its antibody cocktail treatment for the new coronavirus and is aiming to have hundreds of thousands of preventative doses available by the end of August.

Lilly's shares were up 2.5% at $156.75 before the bell.

915,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",Aircraft makers go digital to fight coronavirus delivery logjam,"By Francesca Landini
MILAN (Reuters) - Helicopter and jet makers are turning to digital technology so customers can inspect their big-ticket purchases remotely before taking delivery, as they strive to push through deals paralyzed by the coronavirus pandemic and bring in much needed cash. 
With outside quality inspectors unable to travel to factories to examine aircraft because of lockdowns, manufacturers hope the remote systems will ease the logjam in deliveries after they slowed to a trickle in April.
Aircraft makers make at least half their revenue and generate significant cash at delivery. The pandemic has caused a cash squeeze across the industry, so every delivery counts.
Planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) ""e-delivered"" three A320neo jets in April and Italian helicopter maker Leonardo (MI:LDOF) is in talks with 20 clients about using its ""smart delivery"" HeliLink video system for inspections. But deliveries remain at a fraction of usual levels.
Turboprop make ATR, which is co-owned by Leonardo and Airbus, is also offering customers digital ways to sign off on their purchases after it failed to make any deliveries in the first quarter.
Nevertheless, industry sources say there are still significant obstacles that are likely to check a resurgence in deliveries anytime soon.
Customers have themselves been hit hard by the slump in demand for air travel since the pandemic struck and many buyers are also reluctant to trust remote inspections following a raft of quality problems on customized jetliner cabins.
Ishka aviation consultancy said May airplane deliveries could be worse than depressed levels seen in April.
Taking delivery of an aircraft worth millions of dollars is a complex process involving pilots, inspectors and lawyers before handover documents are signed. Finished jets have been known to sit at factories for months while airlines squabbled over cabin quality.
There are two parts to the delivery process: the technical commercial inspection, which is when any disputes tend to arise, and taking ownership of the aircraft, which triggers payment.
The plans for ""digital deliveries"" do not cover the safety of individual aircraft, which is regulated by public authorities.
CASH CYCLE
Leonardo's HeliLink app allows clients to carry out tests and perform maintenance remotely, using on-site specialists connected by video. The helicopter is then shipped to the client or a Leonardo service outpost to be collected.
A company source said Leonardo's first ""smart delivery"" would be finalised in the coming days.
Leonardo delivered 11 helicopters in the first quarter, barely half the 19 that went to clients in the same period last year, helping to drive divisional revenue down 13%.
""Smart deliveries could involve up to 20 customers in the next few months,"" the company source said.
Airbus has created a three-stage e-delivery process which involves connecting with the buyer in a secure virtual environment where the two sides can simplify contractual transactions, from drafting and negotiating the delivery documents up to the remote transfer-of-title digital signature.
Industry sources said the digital transfer of ownership can save paperwork and legal costs, but that few airlines have so far been willing to delegate physical inspections to manufacturers, especially of larger jets.
In the United States, Boeing (N:BA) has completed virtual shipments in the past and is ready to offer them again, according to one industry source, but is mainly focused on restoring its grounded 737 MAX to service after resuming output last week. 

Even so, some analysts believe the innovation will smooth deliveries even after the pandemic. ""The industry is bracing for a tough period of two or three years,"" said Paolo Rinaldini of AlixPartners consultancy. ""Digital delivery is a good solution to shorten the cash cycle and get the money for the goods sold.""

917,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>",Republican Senators Turn Up Heat on Twitter After Fact-Checks,"(Bloomberg) -- After President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at striking a blow against social media platforms, several Republican Senators piled on, looking for additional ways to reign in  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR). and other sites conservatives often accuse of being biased against their views.
On Friday, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas asked the Justice Department and the Treasury to investigate “possible criminal violations” by Twitter for hosting the accounts of top Iranian government officials. Cruz argues that Twitter accounts held by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and Javad Zarif, the foreign minister, violate U.S. sanctions against Iran.
Cruz aimed his ire directly at Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey. “The irony of this is that at the same time that Twitter, that Jack Dorsey, is publishing worldwide the antisemitic threats of violence from the Ayatollah Khamenei, Jack Dorsey is also trying to censor the president of the United States,” Cruz said in an interview Friday on Fox Business. “He’s trying to silence genuine political speech by Americans while facilitating terroristic threats by Iran.”
Republican Senators, including Tom Cotton, Josh Hawley and Marsha Blackburn, have also been eager to strike back at Twitter after what they say is censorship of the president. Calls for action increased late last week after Twitter put a fact-check label on two of Trump’s tweets regarding mail-in ballots. An incensed Trump issued an executive order on Thursday that seeks to repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law passed by Congress in 1996 that provides protections to online media platforms, shielding them from liability for the content posted on their sites.
The next day, Twitter affixed a warning label to one of Trump’s posts about protests in Minneapolis that Twitter said violated its policy against glorifying violence. It was the first time the company has applied that type of warning label to one of the president’s tweets and the move ratcheted up tensions further with Trump and his supporters.
Senator Hawley of Missouri fired off a letter to Dorsey, saying that Twitter’s decision to “single out the president for disfavor, based on his political speech, is alarming.” He said Twitter’s decision to “editorialize” raises questions about why it should continue to receive special status and immunity under Section 230. Hawley asked Dorsey for a response and the “sources on which Twitter relied to decide to editorialize regarding the president’s political speech” by June 15.
For Twitter, Republican backlash was inevitable: There’s a long history there. Dorsey, and other fellow Silicon Valley executives, were grilled by Congress in hearings in 2018 over election interference and allegations of conservative bias. Cruz first raised alarms about Twitter’s decision to allow Iranian government officials to tweet in February, though he significantly escalated the situation Friday with his letter requesting a criminal investigation. Hawley has long been determined to strike a blow to technology companies’ protections under Section 230 and Trump’s executive order has helped thrust the senator’s pet issue into the national spotlight.
While the increased public pressure may be uncomfortable for Twitter, it’s unclear what practical repercussions could come as a result. For example, Twitter and other technology companies have long argued that they aren’t violating American laws against doing business with Iran simply by allowing Iranians to post on their platforms. The Supreme Leader has been on Twitter since March 2009. A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment on Cruz’s letter.
Some legal scholars are also skeptical that Trump’s executive order has the power to override a law passed by Congress. The order also pushes the government to stop advertising on social media platforms, a directive that could be challenged by technology companies. The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s civil liberties director has argued that similar mandates have been struck down by the courts for violating free speech.
“Republicans are going to make a lot of noise about this, but it’s just noise because the First Amendment prevents them from doing what they want to do,” said Nu Wexler, a former associate communications director at Twitter until 2017 and an experienced tech policy executive who also has worked at  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Google and previously worked in Democratic politics. “It’s a legal dead end, because Twitter is a private company and they have the right to enforce their own policies as they see fit.”
Republican lawmakers could try to drag Dorsey in front of Congress again. But unlike Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.’s Google and Facebook, which are both under intense antitrust scrutiny, Twitter is unlikely to face similar pressure, given its comparatively humble $24 billion market capitalization, much smaller user base and narrower scope of business. Some tech observers see the lack of antitrust pressure as an advantage for Twitter, helping give it the courage to take tough stands against the president with less concern about retribution than its peers.
And while Republican senators may seek consequences for Twitter’s decision to fact-check the president, there are major ideological disagreements among conservatives about whether the government should be in the business of deciding how technology companies run their platforms. “It’s honestly fairly contrary to Republican conservative principles,” said Charles Duan, director of technology and innovation policy at the free market think tank R Street Institute. “The idea that the government should engage in regulation of private companions in order to limit what they are able to do with their free speech rights is pretty remarkable to me.”
But Republican voters are animated by the idea that social media companies are trying to censor their point of view, he said. “As a practical matter I understand what they’re going for, it’s something that does bring a certain class of the electorate together.”
Duan said the federal government has tried to create its own forms of social networks, including an online petition portal, and has ended up censoring objectionable content aggressively. Meanwhile, conservatives have long opposed legislation like the Fairness Doctrine, that has attempted to force companies to behave with political neutrality. When that legislation was repealed in 1987, it allowed for the proliferation of right-wing talk radio.
Even Ben Shapiro, the conservative podcast host, has expressed skepticism about the effort to repeal Section 230. “The invitation to redefine ‘unfair business practices’ to include comment-policing-based lawsuits will likely not end well for conservatives,” Shapiro tweeted Thursday. “I see the appeal, but I’m wondering just why conservatives are suddenly so unconcerned about political bias among regulators.”
The renewed hostility from Republicans could have one silver lining for Twitter -- it could make Democrats more inclined to rally to its defense. “This Executive Order is egregiously excessive with clearly malevolent intent to suppress free speech,” Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said in a statement. “It is a blatant attempt to use the full power of the United States government to force private companies to lie for him.”

918,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",SocGen Quants Skeptical on Stocks Amid ‘Wobbly’ Cyclicals Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks may be well off their mid-March lows, but Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA’s quantitative strategists are wary of the rally.
“From a market technical perspective, the cyclical recovery has been very volatile, wobbly, up one week, down the next, indicating the fragility of the market recovery,” Solomon Tadesse, head of North American equity quant research, said in an email May 31. “If this is a true economic recovery and if the March market plunge is the market bottom, we should see a clear and strong rebound in cyclicals.”
Cyclical stocks, those that benefit most when the economy is running hot, have shown some signs of resurgence. On Tuesday and Wednesday last week, the Russell 2000 Index outperformed the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 Index by more than 2.5 percentage points only to lag behind by about 2 percentage points in each of the following two sessions. The Russell 1000 Value Index behaved similarly relative to its Growth counterpart.
“The worst may not be over for the market,” Tadesse and colleagues including Andrew Lapthorne wrote in a separate note May 28 that studied the past 100 years of market downturns and recoveries. While optimism about economic recovery might be spurring gains in cyclicals, the uncertainty about how the pandemic will end, and the timeline of potential vaccines, will limit their advance, they said.
SocGen’s warning comes as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). on May 29 pared its forecast for further declines, citing the strength of stock gains and support from fiscal stimulus and monetary policy. Strategists led by David Kostin moved their downside S&P 500 forecast to 2,750, from a previous 2,400, compared with the May 29 close of 3,044.
Still, Goldman sees a number of reasons to be cautious on U.S. stocks, including lack of buybacks and narrow participation in the recent gains. Even JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., which made an early call that the worst was behind markets, tamped down its optimism on equities last week.
The situation further out in the future is promising, Tadesse said.
“In the medium term, as all clears up and economic recovery holds, I expect a significant cyclical rally, given also the depressed valuations,” he said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3) reported a $292 million first quarter loss on Monday due to a coronavirus crisis sales slump and the impact of a failed deal with  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
Embraer also said it was seeking new liquidity. Reuters reported that Brazil's development bank BNDES is helping coordinate a $600 million loan for the planemaker, which burned through $677 million in cash in the quarter.
The firm said its decision to put staff on paid leave in January in order to finalize details of the Boeing deal was largely responsible for a 23% drop in revenue. In March, Embraer again put workers on leave due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Boeing was going to buy most of Embraer's commercial aviation unit for $4.2 billion, but the deal collapsed suddenly in April, leaving Embraer without a clear plan B.
Reuters reported on Friday that China, Russia and India were circling Embraer and studying potential moves, although any talks would be preliminary.

Embraer said on Monday that it was not currently negotiating with China's state-owned COMAC, Russia's Irkut or India on any potential deal to replace the one with Boeing, adding that it regularly evaluates potential partnership options.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Well-timed trades in  Gilead Sciences Inc 's (O:GILD) options ahead of good news on the biopharmaceutical company's COVID-19 drug treatment may draw regulatory scrutiny, experts said.
On April 17, Gilead's shares jumped nearly 10% following a media report detailing encouraging partial data from trials of the U.S. company's experimental drug remdesivir in severe COVID-19 patients.
Those gains were dwarfed by a price jump in bullish options which traded in unusually high volume just hours before the report and which more than doubled in value overnight.
Remdesivir subsequently received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization to treat COVID-19 patients on May 1.
Gilead has not heard from regulators regarding the trades, company spokesman Chris Ridley said, declining any additional comment on the matter.
Early in the trading day on April 16, with Gilead shares hovering around $75, four large blocks of its options were purchased for about $1.5 million each. Those unusually large trades bet that Gilead's shares would rise north of $80 to $87.50 by mid August.
""They are pretty big trades,"" said Henry Schwartz, president of options analytics firm Trade Alert, adding that the fact they were made around the same time was also unusual. ""It stands out,"" he said.
In one of the trades, 3,143 calls betting Gilead's shares would rise above $85 by Aug. 21 were purchased for a total of $1.6 million. Through April 17, the value of those contracts jumped to $3.02 million, according to a Reuters analysis of trading data. The other three trades also made large gains.
On Friday, Gilead shares closed at $77.83.
""This looks problematic,"" said Howard Fischer, a partner with law firm Moses & Singer and former senior trial counsel at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
""When there is a specific spike in the firm's trading activity — right before a finding is announced — it can become a red flag to regulators,"" he said.
The SEC scans for unusual trades ahead of news announcements and has used such data to bring insider trading probes in the past, public filings show. The agency declined to comment. 
While it is possible the trades were fortuitous, driven by bullish sentiment for drugmakers amid the pandemic, options trades in other pharmaceutical names did not show similar activity, according to a Reuters review.

""It does look like somebody had some sort of reason to pick that time of day to put a lot of capital to work on Gilead,"" said Schwartz.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. utility stocks have started to look like bargains after being considered expensive relative to the broader market for well over a year. Still, the outlook is far from certain as demand this summer is set to be hard hit by the contraction in commercial and industrial usage. 
Electricity use typically peaks in the summer as air conditioning units in homes, offices and factories are cranked up. But COVID-19 lockdowns have shuttered businesses and shifted many workers away from the office park and into home offices. 
""There's still some downside ahead as the economy is concerned, and utilities would be a way to be defensive and protect your portfolio during a recession,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.
Grid operator New York ISO said on Thursday lockdowns ""led to an 8-10% drop in overall electricity usage throughout the New York Control Area."" It did not specify a time period.
""The state's grid is well-equipped to handle forecasted summer demand,"" said Wes Yeomans, vice president of operations at New York ISO, whose summer 2020 peak load forecast is down from the previous year. 
Reduced load forecasts are unsurprising, with business activity posting record plunges in the Atlantic region and across the country. 
Both the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State business index and the Institute for Supply Management's more broad, nationwide purchasing managers' index have shown drastic contractions, plunging well within recession territory.

(Graphic-ISM PMI: https://tmsnrt.rs/2AhnNHI)
Some utilities may be more vulnerable to lockdown pressures, depending on the regions they serve. ""Utilities with large commercial-industrial customers could see record-breaking demand drops,"" wrote Andrew Bischof, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, in a research note. 
Northeastern utilities, which have a high concentration of commercial/industrial and residential customers, all mentioned this demand drop in their recent earnings calls.
Consolidated Edison (N:ED), which serves New York City, lowered its full-year guidance and estimated that commercial delivery revenue declined by 16% for non-weather-related reasons from March 16 to April 30. 
Public Service Enterprise Group Inc (N:PEG) noted a similar decline in electric load from the end of March through April, and said the reduction could extend through the second quarter.
""I do think what you're going to see is a downward trend or downward pressure on the commercial sales,"" Philip Lembo, chief financial officer of Eversource Energy (N:ES), told analysts recently.
Utility revenue could also face headwinds from emergency measures to ease financial hardships due to unprecedented pandemic-related job loss, including suspension of past due collections and late fees.
Still, after underperforming the broader market over the last 12 months, utilities, considered a ""safe-haven"" bond proxy, have appeared relatively cheap.
(Graphic-Utilities valuation and performance: https://tmsnrt.rs/2ZKChuc)
Many unknowns lie in wait for utilities this summer. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Outlook predicts a 60% chance of an above-normal season. 
Additionally, while northeastern utilities have observed a slight uptick in residential electricity demand, a painful economic recovery could cap those benefits.

""If I'm a factory worker and the line is shut down, my income is going to be impacted,"" Pavlik added. ""So am I going to run the air conditioner or open my windows?""

(Reuters) -  Capital & Counties Properties  (L:CAPCC) has agreed to buy a 26.3% stake in London rival  Shaftesbury  (L:SHB) from Hong Kong tycoon Samuel Tak Lee's for 436 million pounds ($540.7 million), the real estate manager said on Monday.
Both Capco and Shaftesbury own large parts of the real estate in London's West End central area. Capco is acquiring the stake from Veloqx, a trust fund set up by Tak Lee, for 540 pence per share, a discount of 13.9% to Shaftesbury's closing share price on Friday.
Major British property deals have all but come to a standstill as the coronavirus outbreak has led to retailers and other business halting rental payments, and cast doubt on both current and future valuations of buildings and portfolios.
Capco shares rose 2.8% to 168 pence in early trade, while Shaftesbury, which rose as much as 3% on Friday, fell 0.5% after the deal was announced.
Capco said the deal, which is expected to be completed in two tranches, would be fully funded through its shopping and entertainment estate Covent Garden's revolving credit facility of 705 million pounds.
""We consider the acquisition a shrewd move, utilising a strong balance sheet to capitalise on an attractive valuation,"" Liberum analysts said in a note.
In order to deploy cash towards the deal, Capco will not complete the share buy-back of 100 million pounds to shareholders, the FTSE-250 listed company said.
Rothschild & Co was the lead financial adviser and sponsor for Capco on the deal.
Separately, Shaftesbury said Tak Lee has withdrawn all legal proceedings against it over allegations and claims related to a 2017 share placement conducted by the company.

930,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>",Hurricanes may cause more pain for pandemic-hit insurers,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - The official start of the Atlantic hurricane season on Monday could signal more steep losses for insurers and reinsurers, already battered by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on their underwriting and investment positions.
However, recent years of hefty damage from hurricanes and high claims due to the pandemic mean property rates at a key June 1 renewal date are expected to get pushed up by as much as 50%, providing an income boost.
Meteorologists are forecasting that the Atlantic 2020 hurricane season, which officially finishes on Nov. 30, will be above average.
""What we've seen over the past couple of years is an increase of (storm) losses from a frequency and severity perspective,"" said Susan Fallon, Global Head of Property at Zurich Insurance Group (OTC:ZFSVF).
    ""There's an expectation we will see increased rates.""
Lloyd's of London this month forecast more than $100 billion in underwriting losses from the pandemic in 2020, with those losses coming before the hurricane season even gets going.
The specialist insurance market said the pandemic losses were similar in size to the loss year of 2005 - when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans - and 2017 - when Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria hit Florida, Puerto Rico and Texas.
Those hurricane years were exceptional but this year could also be costly.
(For an interactive graphic on evacuation, displacements from recent hurricanes click https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/azgpobkajvd/index.html)
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) sees 13-19 named storms of which 6-10 could become hurricanes. 
The average hurricane season produces 12 named storms and six hurricanes, three of which are major.
The exact impact of hurricanes is always difficult to determine as many do not make landfall.
But the average for insured losses from natural catastrophes globally is $75 billion over the past 10 years, according to reinsurer Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY).
Climate change has led to greater flood damage from hurricanes, and increased building of expensive properties in states such as Florida has also added to the size of claims, industry sources say.
KBW analysts said in a note that reinsurance rates in Florida could rise 25-45% on June 1, with the underwriting and investment losses from COVID-19 ""heightening risk sensitivities"" and contributing to the rise. 
Reinsurers share the burden of large losses like hurricanes in return for part of the premium. Insurers typically pass at least part of the reinsurance rates they pay onto policyholders.
""We've seen rates for Florida renewals accelerate quite a bit,"" said Chris Grimes, a director at Fitch Ratings. Rate increases were in the 20-40% range, or up to 50% for some insurers, Grimes said. Analysts at JMP Securities expect rate rises of 25-35%.
The rate rises could sweeten the pill for insurers and reinsurers, which also face $100 billion in investment losses this year, according to Lloyd's' estimates.
But the impact of the pandemic is also expected to exacerbate hurricane losses.
Medical facilities and other businesses might take more precautions in advance of a storm, adding to the cost of claims, Karen Clark, co-founder and CEO of catastrophe modelling firm Karen Clark & Company said.
Reinsurer Munich Re highlighted added risks from the pandemic to response and recovery, supply chains and coastal evacuations.
The Bahamas would be particularly vulnerable, Munich Re said, as it continues to deal with last year's Hurricane Dorian, while the pandemic has also hit its tourist industry.

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Monday on hopes of a post-coronavirus global recovery, with investors relieved that the U.S. response to China's national security law in Hong Kong was not as bad as feared.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX) rose 0.6%, hovering near its strongest level since March 9, led by gains in banks (SX7P), miners (SXPP) and travel & leisure stocks (SXTP).
U.S. President Donald Trump began the process of ending special treatment for Hong Kong to punish China, but did not mention actions that could undermine the U.S.-China Phase One trade deal.
""The markets are focused on the bigger global picture and a slightly calmer tone on the U.S.-China front,"" said Keith Temperton, a trader at Tavira Securities.
""However, things are definitely in the pipeline regarding the Hong Kong situation. The more of this goes on, there will be a reaction and markets will be caught by surprise."" 
Global markets kicked off June on a strong note, with the STOXX 600 recovering nearly 31% since March lows as hopes of COVID-19 vaccine, easing lockdowns and expectations of more stimulus helped improve risk appetite.
The European Central Bank will meet on Thursday and investors expect policymakers to ramp up the bond-buying program. 
Meanwhile, business activity surveys showed Germany's manufacturing sector continued to contract in May, even as a slump in factory activity in France and Spain eased.
Among individual stocks, Italy's  Mediobanca  (MI:MDBI) jumped 9.4% after billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio confirmed he had asked for green light from the European Central Bank to increase his stake in the company.
Spain's MasMovil (MC:MAS) surged more than 21% as buyout funds KKR (N:KKR), Cinven and Providence mounted a friendly bid to pay up to 2.96 billion euros ($3.30 billion) for the telecom operator.
Primark-owner Associated British Foods (L:ABF) gained 6.4% as it announced it was working to re-open all its 153 stores in England on June 15.
UK fashion brand  Ted Baker  (L:TED) slumped 11.3% as it rolled out plans to raise 95 million pounds ($117.84 million) through a stock issue to help it ride out the challenges posed by the coronavirus.

So are the herd of Hippogriffs from Hogwarts, and the T.Rex from Jurassic Park as Universal Studios Japan said on Monday its theme park in Osaka would open later this month for the first time since closing in March due to the coronavirus.
The Japanese theme park operator owned by U.S. cable and media company Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) said it would reopen on June 8 to residents of Osaka Prefecture, and to residents of nearby regions from June 19.
Universal Studios Japan's (USJ) reopening comes after the Asian nation lifted its state of emergency on Osaka Prefecture and surrounding regions on May 21 following a sustained fall in the number of coronavirus infections in the area.
On its website, USJ said visitors will be required to wear face masks on park grounds at all times. They will have their temperature checked before entry, and will be required to follow social distancing rules on rides and other attractions, it added.
Other businesses, along with schools, and museums have been slowly reopening around the country in the past two weeks. Department stores and cinemas in Tokyo opened their doors for the first time since April, after the city ended its state of emergency last week.
While residents of Osaka and nearby areas will soon be able to reunite with the blood-thirsty great white shark and sip Harry Potter's favourite butterbeer at the Three Broomsticks inn, fans of Mickey Mouse and his friends will have to wait longer to visit Tokyo Disneyland.
In a statement, theme park operator Oriental Land Co (T:4661) said on Monday it would extend the closure of Tokyo Disneyland, and consider the government's timing of lifting restrictions on businesses and its own operations in deciding when to reopen the Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) theme park.

Its domestic sales rose 5% year-on-year, led by popular models such as the Grandeur sedan and new models such as all-new Elantra and premium brand Genesis' G80 sedan. 
However, overseas sales fell 50% on year due to weak auto demand from slowing economic activities stemming from COVID-19, the automaker said in a statement. 
South Korea's May auto exports fell 54% on year despite the sequential resumption of sales at dealerships in major countries, due to increased inventory from low sales in the previous month and decreased demand in major markets such as the U.S. and Europe, the trade ministry said in a separate statement on Monday.

MADRID (Reuters) - Buyout funds KKR (N:KKR), Cinven and Providence have mounted a friendly bid to pay up to 2.96 billion euros ($3.30 billion) for Spain's MasMovil (MC:MAS), the companies said on Monday, sending shares in the telecom operator soaring more than 20%.
It is the first attempt by heavyweight private equity investors to buy a publicly listed company in Europe in a so-called take-private deal since the coronavirus crisis brought most transactions in the region to a halt.
The funds offered 22.50 euros per MasMovil share and said shareholders with 29.56% had already committed to sell at a price that represents a 20% premium over its price at the end of trading on Friday.
MasMovil, founded in 1997, sells fixed line, mobile and Internet services. It has grown through acquisitions, bolstering its claim to the fiercely competitive Spanish market, snapping up lower-cost brands Pepephone and Yoigo in 2016.
Its stock leapt at the market open and was changing hands at 0740 GMT for 22.8 euros, a touch above the offer price and more than 22% higher than they had closed the previous week. 
Chief Executive Meinrad Spenger said in a bourse statement that MasMovil had met its suitors and signed an agreement regarding the bid, which it said would be ""beneficial for the shareholders and other stakeholders in the company"".
The bidders have told the company they would maintain continuity in the company's strategy, staff and executive team, the statement said.
The bid is conditional on acceptance from at least 50% of shareholders, the funds said.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to edge higher Monday, as investors cautiously welcome further signs of growth from China as well as a limited response from U.S. President Donald Trump to Beijing tightening control over the city of Hong Kong.
At 2:10 AM ET (0610 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.5% higher. {{167|France's CACAC 40 futures were up 1.4%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.3%.
China’s official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index came in at 50.6 on Sunday, indicating that manufacturing activity in the second largest economy in the world continued its expansion in May.
While this has been welcomed, May’s figure still came in below April’s 50.8 level, as well as below the 51 level predicted by many analysts.
Helping the positive tone was the decision from President Trump not to end phase one of its trade deal with China when he laid out his response to China’s national security law for Hong Kong and Macau on Friday, although he did vow to end Hong Kong's special status.
“Trump’s presser on action against China for implementing the Hong Kong Security Bill, which the White House has alleged strips Hong Kong of any autonomy, proved to be more bark than bite,” Vishnu Varathan, Miuzho Bank’s head of economics and strategy, said in a note. “With specific and verifiable measures against China appearing to be weak, markets may draw hollow consolation that the U.S. is treading carefully.”
This has helped offset worries over riots in a number of U.S. cities, a fresh setback for the world’s largest economy which was only just emerging from a severe downturn. 
Corporate news is thin on the ground Monday, and investors will await Thursday’s meeting of the European Central Bank, which is widely expected to result in a 500 billion-euro ($555 billion) increase to the Pandemic Emergence Purchase Program.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",Escalating China tensions could become an obstacle for U.S. stock rally,"By David Randall and Lawrence Delevingne
NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's directive on Friday to begin the process of eliminating special treatment for Hong Kong is likely to put China-U.S. tensions back in the headlines over the coming months, creating a new driver of volatility in global equity markets. 
Some investors said Trump's move firmly brings back to the fore an issue that had receded earlier this year when Washington and Beijing struck a Phase 1 deal in their months-long battle over trade terms. 
The trade war, which began in earnest in the spring of 2018, had been a constant source of volatility for global markets, as a steady drip of headlines whiplashed investors. The Phase 1 deal helped push the S&P 500 to all-time highs earlier in the year, until coronavirus hit. Since then COVID-19 has been the primary driver of investor sentiment.
While tension between the world's two largest economies started to re-emerge over the past month as the United States blamed China for the spread of the virus, Trump's move now could mark the beginning of a new round of escalation. Investors said it is likely to lead to volatility as the administration looks to eliminate a range of policy agreements, from extradition to export controls, and threatens new sanctions. 
""What Hong Kong represents is longer than a one-day or one-year issue,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. Paulsen said he believes that geopolitical tensions are likely to hang over markets over the longer term.
A re-emergence of U.S.-China tensions would add to serious risks that already hang over the market. Paulsen and other investors said markets remain focused on the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic and potential signs of a U.S. recovery. 
Some investors also said U.S. and international protests in recent days after the death of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis in police custody last week, could further dent sentiment and particularly hurt retailers and small businesses.
Investors have grown increasingly nervous that the U.S. stock rally over the past two months has become disconnected from the economic devastation wrought by nationwide lockdowns. The S&P is up more than 35% from its March lows, even as key metrics such as unemployment and gross domestic product have flashed their worst readings since the Great Depression. 
MARKET RISK
The rally slowed in May as investors assessed how the virus would behave and how the global economy would recover, as countries started to loosen restrictions. A serious rupture between Washington and Beijing now could throw a wildcard in that assessment.
Erin Browne, a portfolio manager at Pimco, the massive bond fund, said strains in the U.S.-China relationship is ""one of the primary market risks"" into the second half of 2020. She said she is hedging her portfolio accordingly.
Browne said the tensions may weigh on the Phase 1 trade deal. ""While a repeal of the Phase 1 trade deal between the U.S.-China would hurt market sentiment into an important election year for President Trump, the risks of that happening are escalating,"" she said. 
Indeed, late last month White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Trump was so ""miffed"" with Beijing over the novel coronavirus and other matters that the U.S.-China trade deal is not as important to him as it once was.
ELECTION POLITICS 
Trump's tough rhetoric against China comes in the midst of a 2020 re-election campaign in which opinion polls show U.S. voters increasingly embittered toward Beijing, especially over the novel coronavirus.
Others said the looming U.S. presidential election means Trump will tread carefully to prevent a wider rupture. 

""Trump was in between a rock and a hard place, because it's very popular right now to be down on China ... particularly with his base,"" said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading. ""On the other hand to have come out with harsher penalties or sanctions would risk the stock market.""

943,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>","Haunted By Austerity, Least-Indebted EU State Goes Big on Virus","(Bloomberg) -- Memories of harsh austerity in the wake of the global financial crisis are motivating Estonia to end what’s been the continent’s greatest aversion to borrowing.
The Baltic region became the poster child for the kind of public spending and wage cuts that later ravaged nations like Greece. Estonia remains the European Union’s least-indebted member-state -- without a single government bond.
The Covid-19 pandemic is changing that, with a 10-year debt sale of at least 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) due in the coming weeks. Another of a similar size is planned for the fall and a third is possible next year, with maturities of up to 15 years under discussion, according to Finance Minister Martin Helme. Money will be channeled into investment to boost economic growth.
“In the previous crisis, there were policy mistakes that deepened our recession,” he said in an interview in Tallinn. “This total austerity that was imposed very strictly then made the situation worse and we have to take a different approach.”
As well as contributing to the steepest recession in Estonia’s history, the post-2008 policies prompted an exodus of workers from the Baltic region to Europe’s west, where salaries are higher. Austerity -- which reached 9% of gross domestic product in 2009 -- also stoked resentment at home that facilitated the rise of right-wing parties like Helme’s EKRE, a junior partner in Estonia’s one-year-old government.
After adopting the euro in 2011, Estonia has increasingly debated whether it should borrow more for investment, with such calls intensifying after the European Central Bank first embarked on quantitative easing. Defenders of the country’s austere stance say the policies were justified to successfully join the euro region and boost exports, while it would have been tricky to borrow in Estonia’s old currency.
Helme said the pandemic made a bond sale “unavoidable” in the face of economic-rescue costs and lost tax revenue. But the change also reflects a view that this is the only way to close the wealth gap with richer neighbors more quickly.
“If other countries have over decades accelerated their economic growth this way, among other things by bringing investments forward through borrowing, I think we shouldn’t be ruling out this option due to some inflexible ideological denial,” Helme said.

944,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",Lufthansa Bailout to Trigger Onslaught From Low-Cost Rivals,"(Bloomberg) --  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY) may have won its battle for state aid, but its surrender of airport slots to appease regulators heralds heightened conflict between European aviation’s old guard and low-cost challengers.
A rivalry that’s been simmering for years has been given fresh impetus by the coronavirus crisis, with former flag carriers falling back on government support as discounters including Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY) Plc and Wizz Air Holdings Plc argue that the market alone should dictate who survives.
Lufthansa’s 9 billion-euro ($9.9 billion) bailout and a slots accord with the European Union overnight Friday handed the region’s biggest airline a lifeline. Now, the German group and network carriers such as Air France-KLM face a battle royale in repelling no-frills operators that came into the crisis stronger and plan to use it to gain ground in territories hitherto largely closed to them.
“We are trying to take advantage of the situation,” Wizz Chief Executive Officer Jozsef Varadi said in an interview. “Lufthansa is getting a huge financial edge, but they’ll need to restructure after taking all of this money. So Germany will bring opportunities.”
Discount airlines have received only modest support compared with legacy carriers. Ryanair, Wizz and EasyJet Plc have tapped the U.K.’s Covid Corporate Financing Facility for a combined 1.5 billion pounds ($1.8 billion), while Air France-KLM has received 7 billion euros from the French state and could overtake Lufthansa’s bailout once Dutch support is finalized.
Low-cost carriers have also been quicker off the mark in slashing costs, with Ryanair, which has its biggest base at London Stansted, announcing 3,000 job cuts a month ago when Lufthansa was still in the early stages of putting together its bailout request.
The strength of the challenge to Lufthansa in particular will depend on take-up for the 12 pairs of daily flight slots to be made available to competitors at its Frankfurt and Munich hubs as part of the bailout settlement ordered by the EU. Complicating matters is a proviso that says only new entrants can obtain the takeoff and landing rights during the first 18 months.
That would allow Ryanair, which has flights in Frankfurt, to target Munich, and EasyJet to do the reverse. Budapest-based Wizz, Europe’s third-biggest discount carrier, doesn’t currently serve either airport so could seek slots at both, though Varadi said the cost of flying from first-tier hubs will be an issue.
Spokespeople for Ryanair and EasyJet declined to comment.
Lufthansa’s labor unions are expressing concern about a race to the bottom on pay and conditions. The airline’s pilot, cabin-crew and ground-crew unions wrote to European Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen on Friday saying that a shift of slots to low-cost carriers would cause a “massive hollowing out” of labor standards.
That budget airlines will make inroads isn’t a given.
Stationing staff in Germany means grappling with stringent employment laws and powerful unions, potential headaches for carriers seeking to keep costs low. Also, Frankfurt and Munich are hub airports where a large share of passengers transfer on or off long-distance flights, limiting market share available to short-haul carriers.
Disruption Ahead
The French market could open up as Air France-KLM reins in its network. A restructuring to be presented within months will call for a 40% cut in domestic French capacity by the end of 2021, Chief Executive Officer Ben Smith told shareholders last week.
The company has also said it may raise new equity, potentially triggering EU scrutiny that could lead to slots being made available in the busy Paris and Amsterdam markets. The initial funding package avoided increasing state holdings amid acrimony between the French and Dutch governments over existing stakes.
In Italy, the government has stepped in to nationalize Alitalia, which was in bankruptcy protection even before the virus hit. The rescue is regarded as dubious given the airline’s status, and the EU is expected to begin an investigation. Slot availability in Rome and Milan could be one outcome.
Full-service airlines are also in retreat in the U.K., where British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. have indicated they’ll exit London Gatwick airport to consolidate operations at the city’s Heathrow hub.
That will consolidate Gatwick’s status as a discount and leisure-oriented base, leaving EasyJet unchallenged as the biggest operator and offering an opportunity for Ryanair and Wizz to expand their more modest presence.
Discount airlines are also cutting their cloth, though not nearly so much.
Wizz will maintain all of its European bases and routes, while trimming frequencies, Varadi said. It announced four new hubs and 50 new routes on Friday.
“We’re sensing strong demand, which we aim to tap as travel restrictions ease,” the CEO said.

Strategists led by David Kostin have rolled back their prediction that the S&P 500 would slump to the 2,400 level -- over 20% below Friday’s 3,044 close -- and now see downside risks capped at 2,750. The U.S. equity benchmark could even rally further to 3,200, they wrote in a May 29 note.
“The powerful rebound means our previous three-month target of 2,400 is unlikely to be realized,” the strategists wrote. “Monetary and fiscal policy support limit likely downside to roughly 10%. Investor positioning has oscillated between neutral and low and is a possible 5% upside catalyst.”
The shift came just after JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.’s strategists shifted in the other direction -- reining in their bullish outlook. JPMorgan’s Marko Kolanovic warned about rising U.S.-China tensions in a note May 28.
JPMorgan’s Kolanovic Dials Back Bullish Stance on Equities
Goldman’s strategists maintained their year-end target of 3,000 for the benchmark U.S. stock gauge.
Goldman continues to argue that short-term returns are skewed to the downside -- “or neutral at best” -- thanks to the risk of an economic, earnings, trade or political “hiccup” to the normalization trend. A broader participation in the rally would be needed for the S&P 500 to move meaningfully higher.
The S&P 500 has climbed 36% from its March 23 low, helped by massive fiscal and monetary support, mega-cap outperformance and optimism about the economy restarting, according to Goldman. Last month it argued fear of missing out was a key driver of the rebound in stocks.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were up on Monday morning with China releasing data indicating that its economy moved from contraction into expansion in May.
China’s National Bureau of Statics reported an official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index of 50.6 on Sunday, above the 50-level indicating an expansion.
The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI for May corroborated the expansion, with a reading of 50.7.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 1.65% by 10:57 PM ET (3:57 AM GMT). The Shenzhen Component gained 2.42%.
Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 3.38%, even as investors digested U.S. Donald Trump’s response on Friday to China’s approval of national security laws for the city the day before.
Trump did not provide specific measures in the response, and some investors remained hopeful that the tensions between the two countries would have minimal impact.
“The impact is likely to be limited and more symbolic while the financial sector is unlikely to be affected. We are not too surprised by the move and don’t expect the Hong Kong financial markets to be either,” Sean Darby, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) global equity strategist, said in a research note.
But other investors were concerned that the rising tensions could have larger and more adverse consequences.
“Admittedly, Trump’s presser on action against China for implementing the Hong Kong Security Bill, which the White House has alleged strips Hong Kong of any autonomy, proved to be more bark than bite. With specific and verifiable measures against China appearing to be weak, markets may draw hollow consolation that the U.S. is treading carefully; especially given risks of unintended economic consequences of far more damage being caused to Hong Kong and non-negligible harm to US economic interests,” Vishnu Varathan, Miuzho Bank’s head of economics and strategy, said in a note.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.17%. South Korea’s KOSPI was up 1.45%, even with the country reporting that May exports fell 23.7% year-on-year.
The ASX 200 rose a modest 0.93%. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe is expected to announce that both the cash rate and three-year bond yield target will remain unchanged at 0.25% on Tuesday, with investors also looking to economic data to be released a day later to show whether the country is on the way to recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19."

SYDNEY/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Australian No. 2 shopping mall manager Vicinity Centres (AX:VCX) cancelled its dividend on Monday and said it planned to raise A$1.4 billion ($932 million), underscoring pressure on the retail sector from the new coronavirus outbreak.
The operator of 70 malls said it would ask corporate investors for A$1.2 billion and retail shareholders for another A$200 million to ensure ""flexibility to respond to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 and the evolving retail landscape"", Chief Executive Officer Grant Kelley said.
The company, which has already withdrawn profit guidance, added that it would withhold an interim payout to stockholders because of upheaval brought by the virus which has infected millions of people around the world, prompting governments to order extraordinary restrictions on personal movement.
The capital raising ranks among the largest by Australian companies amid the coronavirus pandemic.
While Australia has seen relatively few cases with about 7,200 infections and 103 deaths as of Monday, brick-and-mortar retailers have been among the worst affected companies with landlords like Vicinity forced to renegotiate leases to match a collapse in sales.
The manager of Westfield-branded shopping malls in Australia,  Scentre  Group (AX:SCG), raised $1.5 billion last month on the United States bond market. Property developer Lendlease, which manages retail assets, raised A$1.21 billion in new shares also last month.
Kelley, the Vicinity CEO, said the company would likely cut the value of its assets by up to 13% or A$2.1 billion later this month. The company was continuing to negotiate with tenants, and stabilisation of rent income ""remains uncertain"".
The company said foot traffic had improved since mid-April when a nationwide stay-home order was still in effect. With restrictions lifting, foot traffic was now 74% of its level at the same time a year earlier, compared to 50% in April.
Vicinity shares were in a trading halt on Monday while the capital raising was in progress.

Corporate retained earnings rose to 484 trillion yen ($4.5 trillion), roughly 89% of the nation’s gross domestic product in the three months to the end of March, according to finance ministry data published Monday.
Japan Inc. Unexpectedly Raised Investment at Start of Year
The extent to which firms tap into this cash hoard will likely be in the spotlight again as the current crisis unfolds, especially for companies that lay off workers.
Policy makers have been doubling down on their support for the economy. Since Abe called a national emergency in early April, his government has put together record stimulus packages worth 234 trillion yen or about 43% of GDP. The Bank of Japan’s special measures total 75 trillion yen.
With the coronavirus threatening jobs and businesses, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura in March urged companies to spend their cash savings to cope with the pandemic.
Japanese firms have taken a more cautious stance on spending their income since the global financial crisis with many of them looking to shore up their finances in case of future economic shocks. This conservative stance has drawn criticism from policy makers, namely Finance Minister Taro Aso, as not being aggressive enough to boost growth through higher wages and investment.

949,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 31, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",China’s Factory Outlook Slips in May Amid Slow Recovery,"(Bloomberg) -- A gauge of China’s manufacturing activity slipped in May, underlining the slow pace of recovery from the first quarter slump.
The official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index declined to a worse-than-expected 50.6 from 50.8 a month earlier, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday. The non-manufacturing gauge rose to 53.6. Readings above 50 indicate improving conditions.
The data indicate that China’s recovery from the pandemic shutdowns risks faltering after an initial rebound supported by pent-up demand. While industrial firms are mostly back at work and output is rising again, a collapse in orders has sent a shock-wave through the sector.
“Global demand is still weak even when lockdowns are relaxed in some major cities around the world,” said Iris Pang, greater China chief economist with ING Bank NV in Hong Kong. “The employment level was in contraction again in May, and that highlights the layoff of factory workers after factories have faced continual withdrawal of export orders.”
The sub-index of new export orders climbed to 35.3, manufacturing employment softened to 49.4, while non-manufacturing employment was at 48.5.
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say
“The Chinese economy should continue to pick up in the coming months. Conditions are on the mend at home. External demand is likely to improve as economies overseas begin to exit lockdowns. That said, the potential for mishaps is high given rising tensions between the U.S. and China.”
Chang Shu, Chief Asia Economist

The government unveiled its stimulus package for the year at the National People’s Congress meeting which concluded last week, and scrapped a hard growth target in light of the uncertain global economy, while pledging targeted monetary easing and trillions of yuan in extra infrastructure spending.
Domestic factories have brought some workers back to staff production lines after the shutdowns in the first quarter and are increasing production, but many are facing a build up in inventories and uncertain orders. Others have not recovered, meaning bankruptcies and unemployment are expected to rise.
“The current global epidemic situation and the world economic situation are still grim and complex, and foreign market demand continues to shrink,” Zhao Qinghe, an economist with the statistics bureau, said in a statement accompanying the data release. Despite small increases in the manufacturing new export order index and import index this month, they “remain at historically low levels,” he said.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and its pilots union said on Sunday they are working to avoid furloughs of roughly 2,300 pilots following a reshuffling process meant to match staffing to summer 2021 flying.
Delta said this month that it would have more pilots than needed as it reduces its network and fleet due to a drop in demand from the COVID-19 pandemic, but is working to avoid involuntary furloughs.
Following the results on Sunday of a so-called ""surplus"" bid in which employees were asked to petition available positions at one of Delta's seven U.S. pilot bases, the airline will be shifting around 7,000 pilots to different locations or aircraft types, while 2,327 have not been assigned to any category, Delta's Master Executive Council (MEC) of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) said in a statement.
Delta confirmed the release of the results of the bid ""to better align our staffing with our future flying demand"" and said it is ""looking at all options to mitigate or minimize furloughs and will continue working with ALPA in the coming weeks to explore those options.""
Atlanta-based Delta, with around 91,000 employees, announced on Thursday details of early out options for non-union employees that include cash severance, full healthcare coverage and travel benefits.
Major U.S. airlines, which have received billions of dollars in taxpayer aid for payroll, have all warned that they will need to reduce their workforce once a government-imposed ban on job cuts expires on Sept. 30.
After air travel demand virtually disappeared in April, U.S. airline executives have pointed to some green shoots, but the industry is not expected to return to pre-pandemic passenger traffic for at least three years.

ALPA said it was continuing to meet with Delta on potential early-out or voluntary leave programs, saying it is ""optimistic that management will continue to engage with ALPA to protect pilot jobs.""

Net foreign assets in the Arab world’s biggest economy declined 4.5%, or $20.9 billion, last month, according to data released Sunday by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority. The fall comes on top of a $27 billion, or 5.4%, plunge in March.
The government is looking to its largest-ever debt program to keep the depletion of reserves limited to 120 billion riyals, as originally planned in the budget. Saudi Arabia has also turned to austerity measures and tripled the value-added tax in an attempt to cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the oil-price rout, which has cut deeply into government revenue for the world’s largest oil exporter.
At the same time, officials say they’re seizing investment opportunities abroad. In the first quarter of this year, the Public Investment Fund -- Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund -- went on a stock buying spree, investing billions of dollars in companies like cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CUK), BP (NYSE:BP) Plc, Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).
In a statement over the weekend, Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan said the government had transferred around $40 billion from the central bank’s foreign currency reserves to the sovereign fund in March and April to enable it to take advantage of recent market turmoil.

“This procedure was taken after comprehensive study and taking into consideration the sufficient level for foreign-currency reserves,” Al-Jadaan said.
Saudi Arabia’s fiscal deficit this year is set to widen to nearly 13% of gross domestic product, according to the International Monetary Fund. Gross official reserves are set to drop to around $456 billion this year, continuing the trend into 2021, when they’re estimated at just over $409 billion, IMF projections show.
Economists say the kingdom still has enough reserves to defend the Saudi riyal’s peg to the dollar. At the end of April, the central bank’s net foreign assets stood at $443 billion.
“Saudi Arabia’s reserves’ position remains comfortable despite the fall,” said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. “The still low debt level provides an additional buffer. This is likely to rise sharply this year and next. Nevertheless, the medium-term oil price and ongoing fiscal adjustment remains critical.”

Futures in New York fell as much as 2.1%, handing back some of Friday’s 5.3% gain. Investors are weighing how violent demonstrations across U.S. cities will impact on the reopening of the world’s biggest economy. Meanwhile, Trump’s long-touted response to China for its crackdown on Hong Kong included a barrage of criticism but stopped short of fully escalating tensions between the two nations.
The market may find some support from a report that OPEC and its allies are considering extending output cuts for one to three months. As the situation in the oil market is moving fast, the preference is to take short-term measures and not disrupt the rebalancing of the market, according to a delegate. The bloc is close to a decision to bring forward its next meeting by a few days to this week, according to people familiar with the situation.
Crude surged a record 88% in May, with U.S. futures on Friday rising above $35 a barrel for the first time since March, driven by massive supply curbs by producers across the world. Still, prices are well below levels at the start of the year, and demand that was crushed by the coronavirus crisis may need to show a sustained improvement for the rally to extend further.
The number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. fell for the 11th week, stemming the massive glut of crude that flooded the market. Yet there’s a risk that oil’s advance could tempt producers to turn on their taps again.
As Chinese oil demand rises to near pre-coronavirus levels, more and more tankers are hauling crude to the Asian nation from almost everywhere. The number of supertankers heading to China has jumped to 127, the highest level since at least the start of 2017, and probably ever, vessel-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg show.

954,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 31, 2020 04:09PM ET</span>",RBA to Keep Stimulus Levers Steady Ahead of Crucial GDP Report,"(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s central bank will keep the stimulus flowing when it meets Tuesday, a day before data that will reveal whether a record recession-free run is drawing to a close.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe is expected to keep both the cash rate and three-year bond yield target unchanged at 0.25%. The bank only bought government securities on two days in May as markets settled and borrowing costs fell. The question now is whether a recession will be avoided.
Australia’s economy is emerging from hibernation as governments begin relaxing lockdown restrictions. The RBA sees GDP shrinking 10% in the first half of this year, with most of that concentrated in the current quarter. Data Wednesday will unveil whether the economy could avoid two consecutive quarters of contraction -- the technical definition of a recession.
“Australia might just do it again,” said Phil Odonaghoe, an economist at Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB), who expects 0.1% growth in the first three months of 2020.
For Lowe, whether or not a technical recession occurs is probably just a sideshow. He’s focused on reversing the almost 600,000 jobs lost in April alone and restoring household and business sentiment.
“With the national health outcomes better than earlier feared, it is possible that the economic downturn will not be as severe as earlier thought,” Lowe told a parliamentary panel Thursday. “Much depends on how quickly confidence can be restored.”
The drop in confidence has firms scaling back expenses. The RBA, in its updated quarterly outlook released in May, said many firms had deferred or canceled investment plans.
“The COVID-19 outbreak and the associated shutdown of the economy has created huge uncertainties,” said Diana Mousina, senior economist at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital. “The good news is that the economy is coming out of hibernation earlier than anticipated.”
By contrast, construction activity data has shown little signs of disruption to the work already in the pipeline in the first quarter. Private sector engineering and non-residential building both advanced in the first three months of 2020.
Economists are waiting for inventories and net exports figures released Tuesday to finalize their forecasts ahead of the GDP report on Wednesday. With the economy certain to go backwards in the current quarter, a negative reading for the first three months of the year would make a technical recession all but inevitable.
Australia last recorded a recession in the first two quarters of 1991 and is in the longest streak of expansion in the post-World War II era. If the economy manages to eke out an expansion in the first quarter, the record will likely continue, given the massive fiscal injection and the success in containing the virus expected to boost activity in the third.
“We’re tracking between the baseline and the upside,” Lowe said of where the economy stands in terms of the RBA’s three scenarios. “I wouldn’t be prepared to say we’re on the upside yet -- the recent data have been better than expected, but I still see a lot of challenges coming down the track.”

957,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Mexican broadcaster Televisa to launch mobile phone service, challenging Slim","By Julia Love
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa said on Sunday it will start offering mobile phone service, a bid to challenge billionaire Carlos Slim's  America Movil  (NYSE:AMX), which has long dominated the country's telecommunications market.
Rather than building infrastructure, Televisa will operate as a mobile virtual network operator, or MVNO, and begin by offering service to existing customers of its cable and home internet packages, sold under its Izzi brand. The broadcaster will rent space on Mexico's wholesale telecom network, operated by Altan Redes.
Televisa originally planned to roll out the service in September, Izzi Chief Executive Salvi Folch said in an interview. But as cases of the coronavirus began climbing, executives sensed the economic turmoil stemming from the virus would create more demand for low-price phone packages and will now launch the service on Monday.
""The pandemic made us accelerate our plans,"" Folch said. ""People will have to spend less on some services. ... We view it as an opportunity.""
Televisa follows in the footsteps of U.S. cable companies such as Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and  Charter Communications  Inc (NASDAQ:CHTR) that have ventured into the mobile market as MVNOs in recent years. 
Mexico has long fought to promote competition in telecommunications, even passing a constitutional reform in 2013 aimed at loosening Slim's grip on the market. Yet global telecoms titans such as AT&T and Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) have failed to meaningfully erode Slim's market share and America Movil still holds about two-thirds of mobile phone lines, according to statistics from Mexican telecom regulator IFT.
Some telecom experts argue the key to boosting competition is to pit America Movil and Televisa, the king of Mexican broadcasting, against each other. 
Televisa's cellular service will be priced at 250 pesos a month per line with unlimited data, about 80% cheaper than comparable packages from America Movil, the broadcaster said. The company will offer the phone plans to roughly 3 million households in 17 Mexican cities. 
Televisa may consider expanding the service beyond its own clients in the future, Folch said, but starting with existing customers enabled the company to capitalize on economies of scale. The broadcaster will also save by directing customers to purchase phones from other vendors, rather than financing devices. 
Televisa has struggled in recent years as broadcasters worldwide grapple with declining viewership. The new offering will strengthen the company's telecom units, which have become its biggest moneymaker, driving close to 70% of net sales in the first quarter.

The loans will finance production to meet demand for passenger planes and executive jets, they said speaking on condition they were not named.
A spokesman for Embraer confirmed that the company is in talks on financing proposals from the BNDES and private bank in Brazil and abroad to aimed mainly at providing working capital to cover plane exports.
Embraer said it has firm orders for the years ahead worth $16 billion on March 31. 
""This shows how sound and balanced the company is in the midst of the crisis hitting the aviation sector,"" one of the sources said.
""No one knows what the future holds in store for commercial aviation, but with less people flying it could well be an era of smaller planes and private aircraft,"" the source added, pointing to Embraer's forte as a leading maker of regional jets.
The Brazilian government has been negotiating a financial bailout for Brazil's airlines to help them cope with the dramatic loss of business during the coronavirus pandemic.

The bailout involving BNDES should be decided by the start of July, and Embraer could receive some $400 million of that aid package that is expected to include bond issues, the sources said.

""I have no intention of closing the Maubeuge factory,"" Senard said on LCI television on Sunday after thousands of employees and family members demonstrated outside the plant the previous day.
Under the proposals unveiled on Friday, a parts reconditioning center in Choisy-le-Roi, south of Paris, is the only facility earmarked for outright closure.

BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa's management board has accepted a more favourable set of demands from the European Commission in exchange for approval of a 9 billion euro ($10 billion) government bailout, the carrier said on Saturday, paving the way for its rescue.
The agreement comes after the airline's supervisory board on Wednesday rejected an initial deal with Brussels including conditions that were significantly more painful.
Lufthansa and the rest of the airline sector have been hard hit by what is expected to be a protracted travel slump due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Under the latest agreement, Lufthansa said it will be obliged to transfer up to 24 takeoff and landing slots for up to four aircraft to one rival each at the Frankfurt and Munich airports.
This translates into three take-off and three landing rights per aircraft and day, it said, confirming what sources had earlier told Reuters.
""For one-and-a-half years, this option is only available to new competitors at the Frankfurt and Munich airports,"" Lufthansa said, initially excluding budget carrier Ryanair. ""If no new competitor makes use of this option, it will be extended to existing competitors at the respective airports.""
The previous deal had included forfeiting 72 slots used by 12 of 300 jets based at the Frankfurt and Munich airports, a source familiar with the matter said.
INTERMEDIATE STEP
The slots, to be allocated in a bidding process, can be taken over only by a European peer that has not received any substantial state aid during the pandemic, Lufthansa said.
The Commision said once it has been officially notified by Germany on the aid package it will assess the issue as a matter of priority.
""(Lufthansa's remedies will) enable a viable entry or expansion of activities by other airlines at these airports to the benefit of consumers and effective competition,"" it said in a statement.
The airline's supervisory board needs to approve the deal, Lufthansa said, adding it would convene an extraordinary general meeting to obtain shareholder approval for the bailout.
The largest German corporate rescue since the coronavirus crisis struck will see the government get a 20% stake in Lufthansa, which could rise to 25% plus one share in the event of a takeover attempt. A deal would also give the government two seats on Lufthansa's supervisory board.
Rivals such as Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM and U.S. carriers American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are all seeking state aid due to the economic effects of the pandemic.
Germany, which has set up a 100 billion euro fund to take stakes in companies hit by the pandemic, said it plans to sell the Lufthansa stake by the end of 2023.
""The German government, Lufthansa and the European Commission have reached an important intermediate step in the aid negotiations,"" the Economy Ministry said in a statement.
It said talks with the Commission over state aid would continue.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) was sued on Friday by a former driver who accused the ride-sharing company of failing to provide required paid sick leave to drivers in Washington, D.C., a policy she said could fuel the spread of the coronavirus.
Cassandra Osvatics, of Bowie, Maryland, accused Lyft of subjecting current and former drivers to a ""Hobbesian choice"" between having to risk their livelihoods by staying home when sick, or ""risk their lives (and the lives of their passengers)"" by working through their illnesses.
Underlying the proposed class action is a belief that Lyft drivers qualify as employees, entitling them in the nation's capital to about seven paid sick days annually based on 2,000 hours worked.
Lyft and larger rival Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc have long contended their drivers are independent contractors, and therefore not owed benefits available to employees.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.
In a statement, San Francisco-based Lyft said it is financially supporting drivers who contract the COVID-19 disease, and helping drivers obtain federal relief including paid sick leave.
""Forced reclassification would jeopardize access to thousands of dollars in federal funds at the worst possible time,"" it said.
Christopher McNerney, a lawyer for Osvatics, said experts believe paid sick leave reduces the spread of illnesses, including when drivers and passengers carry them home.
""This is a national issue, because ride-share companies are not providing sick leave anywhere,"" he said. ""You want drivers to stay home when they're sick, so when you hop in a Lyft car you won't get sick.""
Many ride-sharing employment disputes end up in arbitration, but McNerney said they belong in court because drivers engage in interstate commerce by ferrying passengers across state lines.
In January 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court said a federal arbitration law did not require transportation workers, including independent contractors, engaged in interstate commerce to arbitrate their claims.

The case is Osvatics v Lyft Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, No. 20-01426.

(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said on Friday it will eliminate 13 officer positions even as it adds international flights back to its network, part of a restructuring to address the hit on its business from the coronavirus pandemic.
Chicago-based United said it is increasing trans-Atlantic service from Washington, D.C. and San Francisco to cities across Europe in July thanks to a modest rise in demand, and re-starting service to Tokyo-Haneda, Hong Kong, Singapore and Seoul.
It is also expanding service throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Its July schedule will be down about 75% from normal, versus 90% currently.
U.S. airlines have pointed to slight upticks in demand that had collapsed in April following global coronavirus outbreaks, but they say a slow and uncertain recovery will force a smaller industry.
United is preparing for management and administrative staff to be at least 30% smaller in October, when a government-imposed ban on job cuts expires for companies that have received payroll aid under the CARES Act.
Airlines including United are rolling out programs to induce tens of thousands of employees to accept voluntary leave or early retirement, hoping to avoid widespread furloughs in the fall.
To cut costs now, United is eliminating 13 officer roles effective June 15, though eight of those people will remain with the company until Sept. 30.
It also has offered thousands of flight attendants voluntary separation packages as it tries to match headcount to demand.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) Chief Executive Gary Kelly said on Friday that there will be far more available airline seats than customers ""for some time.""

968,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2020 06:26PM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: Value Vs. Growth,"By Peter Nurse and Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com - Stocks have continued to climb, with the S&P 500 finishing a holiday-shortened week above 3,000.
But rather than previous weeks, diversity has been the name of game, with stalwarts like financials enjoying buyer confidence after techs being the darlings for a while.
Is now the time for investors to look at more than just the FAANG stocks, or will the Nasdaq high flyers continue to be the standard bearers?
Peter Nurse says that the worst looks over for financials, which are still well off their lows, while quality retailers will shine as the more vulnerable ones disappear.
But Yasin Ebrahim argues that the enthusiasm for value stocks is a flash in the pan and growth stocks are simply worth more in a low interest rate environment. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Cyclical Case
U.S. stock indices have recovered back to the levels seen in early March, and it’s been cyclical stocks which have attracted a lot of the fast cash of late. There is still upside for investors to mine, especially where the flirtation with bankruptcy has been the heaviest.
“It's always difficult to trust the cycle at the trough. However, price action suggests it's not different this time. In fact, the cheapest stocks have never been cheaper and this argues for leaning even harder into the wind,”  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said in a research note, published on Wednesday.
In the early stages of the recovery, the strong policy support, both fiscal and monetary, reignited a search for yield, said Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in a research note to clients published on Thursday. But the pick-up in risk appetite has been due to more optimism on growth, it added.
Shocks, such as pandemics, tend to accelerate changes already underway because some of the arguments and forces resisting change are temporarily weakened by short-term necessity.
With falling mall sales and increased online competition, some retailers were struggling before the coronavirus pandemic began. Covid-19 has accelerated their demise, rather than caused it.
But the likely disappearance of some of the weaker members of the herd creates space for quality retailers to shine.
Morgan Stanley points to PVH (NYSE:PVH), one of the largest global apparel companies, with iconic brands such as Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, as a retailer offering healthy upside to its 12-month target of $77.
It’s also important not to forget banks, a sector which can still move with the crests and troughs of economic growth.
Morgan Stanley noted that while early cycle sectors are doing better from the low points in March, the most unloved sectors could still have a long way to go should the recovery continue to make progress.
Obviously there are areas that have been absolutely crushed by the social distancing measures taken to combat the coronavirus outbreak - airlines, cruise liners and mall owners, spring to mind - but the banking sector has also been hurt.
This is mainly due to the very low level of interest rates rather than any balance sheet issues, like during the recent Financial Crisis. Low rates have killed bank profitability in Japan and Europe and there's little reason to suggest the impact will be different in the U.S.
But the Fed has taken every possible opportunity to dismiss the use of negative rates and the two-year Treasury yield hasn't seriously threatened a new low for three weeks now. If the worst really is over, then so too is the risk of negative rates, and bank stocks should respond accordingly, yet JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) is still nearly 40% below its pre-pandemic levels.
While the mortgage market seized up at the start of the coronavirus outbreak as the number of people seeking new loans dwindled, historical data from the late 1990s show a financial crisis is often followed with a steep increase in housing prices and demand for loans.
Morgan Stanley turned overweight on JPMorgan in April, and points to Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG) Group as its newest overweight recommendation in the financials sector. It has a price target of $32, offering some 20% upside to the current level.
The Tech Case
Value stocks had their moment in the spotlight this week, prompting some to suggest the great rotation from value to growth is in play.
But a quick look at recent history signals the move in value this week may ultimately prove equivalent to the makings of a flash mob: fashionable in the moment, performs for a brief time, followed by a quick dispersal.
Value stocks are down nearly 20% this year, while growth stocks, seen as having potential for long-term earnings, are above the flatline. Since 2007, growth has jumped 200% with value up just 40%.
While there will be some who are quick to point out that over a longer term, say 90 years, value has trumped growth, the underlying fundamentals that have given growth an edge over value during the past ten-plus years are likely to remain in place.
The Glorious Backdrop for Growth 
Many have offered their take on why growth has outpaced value, pointing to the widening valuation spread between value and growth stocks, sector biases in value investing and lower-for-longer interest rates.
Financials and energy, which often hold the largest sway in value-investing strategies, are unlikely to make a comeback anytime soon.
Low interest rates, which have kept a lid on bond yields, has left banks struggling to turn a profit on loans and with the added pressure of Covid-19 related defaults, it's fast becoming apparent that money may be better served elsewhere.
Energy, meanwhile, is down by more than third over the past year, and notwithstanding the recent rebound in oil prices on output cuts, the crude demand story remains murky at best.
While the valuation spreads between value and growth stocks cannot continue to widen forever, there are not many who are betting on the global economy returning to rapid growth or interest rates breaking to the upside anytime soon.
In a low interest rate environment, growth stocks are ""just mathematically worth more,” MFS strategist Rob Almeida told Barron’s. ""So the terminal value for a growth company is higher, because of the discount rate, than it is for a cyclical company."""

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia transferred a total of 150 billion riyals ($40 billion) from central bank foreign reserves to fund investments by sovereign wealth fund PIF in March and April, the finance minister said on Friday. 
Saudi Arabia's central bank foreign reserves fell in March by nearly $27 billion month-on-month, their fastest rate in at least 20 years, to around $464.5 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on central bank data. April figures are not yet available.
Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said in a statement that the transfers to PIF were done on an ""exceptional basis.""
The statement did not give a breakdown but a finance ministry official told Reuters that the government transferred $15 billion to the Public Investment Fund in March and another $25 billion in April, saying foreign reserves are expected to drop in April at about the same rate as the previous month.
The official said PIF had also converted into U.S. dollars part of its own riyal-denominated liquidity to back investments. The government did not expect a significant drop in central bank foreign reserves going forward and fluctuations will be in line with previous years, added the official, who asked not to be named because the details are not yet public.
""While foreign exchange flows since the start of the year are on average within historical levels, this measure (transfers to PIF) resulted in a reduction in net foreign reserves assets to support investment plans,"" Jadaan said in the statement, adding that PIF investments would not be reflected in published central bank data.
""Maximising returns on the kingdom's assets will reflect positively on economic performance and public finances and limit negative effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Returns on PIF investments will be available to support public finances when needed,"" he said. 
In April, the head of PIF, Yasir al-Rumayyan, said it was looking in to investment opportunities in areas such as aviation, oil and gas and entertainment. 
The fund, which manages over $300 billion in assets and has stakes in  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and electric car company Lucid Motors, had this year accumulated stakes in four major European oil companies and disclosed an 8.2% stake in cruise operator Carnival Corp (N:CCL).
Earlier this month, it also disclosed stakes in  Boeing Co  (N:BA),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and Marriott.
Jadaan also said in the statement that the government would continue to implement development plans to diversify the economy, increase local content and support private sector growth, whether through the general budget or through PIF and development funds.
The kingdom, the world's largest oil exporter, slipped into a $9 billion budget deficit in the first quarter as oil revenue collapsed.
The finance ministry official said PIF is still going ahead with investments in domestic mega-projects under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's diversification drive, including the $500 billion NEOM economic zone, the Red Sea tourism project, and Qiddiya, an entertainment development that will include a Six Flags (NYSE:SIX) theme park.

He said the fund has significant liquidity in riyals from its own portfolio and from proceeds from last December's initial public offering of state oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222).

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican conglomerate Femsa said on Friday it will pay $398 million in taxes after reaching an agreement with authorities, marking another win for Mexico's government, which recently collected a similar sum from retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) de Mexico.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has threatened to make public the names of 15 companies he said owed a total of $2 billion in taxes, part of his efforts to boost collection in the country with the lowest take in the 37-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 
Femsa  declined to comment when asked if it was among the companies on the president's list.
The company said in a public filing the deal to pay 8.8 billion pesos would ""resolve interpretative differences over taxes paid outside of Mexico, without judicial action."" 
The SAT tax authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Although Mexico is Femsa's core market, the retailer and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bottler also has operations in other parts of Latin America and has recently invested in U.S. businesses. 
The deal follows Walmart de Mexico's (MX:WALMEX) payment of $358 million after negotiations with the government over an even larger sum authorities had aimed to charge over the retailer's 2014 sale of restaurant chain Vips.
Lopez Obrador later praised Walmart de Mexico for its ""good behavior,"" and said it was not on his list of 15 firms that had yet to pay back taxes.
""The majority of them are on their way to being fixed... They don't want lawsuits, they want to fix this and I welcome that,"" he said earlier this week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net bearish bets on the U.S. dollar increased in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The net short dollar position was $8.60 billion for the week ended May 26, compared with a net short position of $7.66 billion for the week before that.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
Traders who are long on a currency believe it will rise in value, while being short points to a bearish bias.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning  that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net short of $7.82 billion, up from $6.58 billion a week earlier.
The U.S. dollar index (=USD), which weighs the currency against a basket of six rivals has fallen 1.47% this week as risk sentiment has improved, sending U.S. stock indexes higher, and denting the greenback's safe-haven appeal. The biggest daily drop this week was recorded on Tuesday, the end of the seven-day period from which the CFTC drew this week's data. 

The dollar's move lower since Wednesday will be reflected in next week's CFTC data, unless the trend is reversed before next Tuesday.

Investing.com – The Dow cut its losses on Friday, capping off its second-straight month of gains as President Donald Trump said the U.S. would end Hong Kong's special treatment but stopped short of imposing new sanctions on China, keeping the U.S.-Sino trade truce intact. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended flat, the S&P 500 rose 0.48%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.29%.
In retaliation for China's move to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong that cracks down on public demonstrations, Trump said the U.S. would take measures to revoke Hong Kong’s special trade status with the United States that grants it favorable terms across trade, financial transactions and immigration. 
Under the new law, Beijing has violated its pledge to ensure Hong Kong retains its high degree of autonomy that has allowed the city to receive special status from the U.S., Trump said.
The reaction in the market was one of relief as investor fears were high heading into the press conference amid reports Trump was considering tougher measures, including sanctions on Beijing.
Trump also continued to blame China for the coronavirus pandemic, the impact of which continues to drag on U.S. economic growth.   
The consumer, the backbone of the economy, reined in spending like never before in April, as shuttered businesses limited consumer opportunities to spend.
Consumer spending fell 13.6% to in April, the steepest since records began, the Commerce Department reported Friday. But some are optimistic the reopening of the economy will trigger a rebound in the coming months as personal savings surged by a record 33%.
""The savings cushion will provide much-needed support for consumer spending as the economy begins to reopen,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note.
Monetary policy was also in focus as Federal Reserve Jerome Powell confirmed that the central bank is just days away from rolling out its Main Street lending facility. Powell also reiterated the negative interest rates are not in the Fed's toolbox as the evidence over its efficacy remains “ambiguous"".
In tech, meanwhile, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) remained in focus, down 2.8% after Trump signed an executive order late Thursday that aimed to weaker the legal protections for social media platforms.

The successful reopening of its parks is a signal event for Disney and the rest of the world as governments and companies strategize how to move out of lockdown while the novel coranavirus is still a threat.
The state also cleared Sea World Entertainment Inc (N:SEAS) to reopen on June 10, said Halsey Beshears, secretary of Florida's Department of Business and Professional Regulation, in a memo sent to officials in Orange County, Florida.
When the Disney parks reopen, guests and employees will be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The resort will suspend parades, fireworks displays and other activities that create crowds. 
Disney will encourage contactless payment systems and expand its existing mobile order systems in restaurants, it said on Wednesday. It plans to restrict the number of guests, who will be required to reserve their park passes ahead of time.
Starting in January, the media and entertainment giant closed theme parks around the world to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The company had estimated it lost $1 billion at its theme parks division from January through March.
On Wednesday, Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Chapek told CNBC the company currently has about 20,000 people per day visiting Shanghai Disneyland, which reopened on May 11 with mandatory masks, temperature screenings and social distancing for visitors and employees.

Disney is soon expected to reveal plans for reopening its Anaheim, California, Disneyland amusement park, the company's original themed attraction.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 was up in late, choppy trading Friday after President Donald Trump made comments on China that appeared less worrisome for the U.S. economy than investors apparently had feared.
Stocks initially extended losses after Trump said China broke its word on ensuring the autonomy of Hong Kong, the former British colony, and said the United States is terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization, something he had threatened to do earlier this month.
""He began speaking in a very tough tone. The market was worried he was going to announce something substantial, something detrimental to the U.S. economy. Then as he spoke it became clear the actions being taken were not going to be as dramatic as originally feared,"" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Increased tensions between the United States and China are taking some shine off the market as it was about to wrap up another month of strong gains.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 3.99 points, or 0.02%, to 25,404.63, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 8.35 points, or 0.28%, to 3,038.08, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 85.58 points, or 0.91%, to 9,454.57.
The S&P 500 opened weaker on Friday amid the concerns over the U.S.-China tensions.

Despite worsening relations between the world's two largest economies, expectations of a quick economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic have driven the S&P 500 (SPX) up more than 30% from its March lows.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Scores of German business executives were due to return to China on Friday evening, beneficiaries of an accelerated entry procedure offered by Beijing as both countries seek to reignite their economies after months of lockdown.
Under a deal brokered by the German Chamber of Commerce in China, staff from hundreds of German companies with units there can return without undergoing two weeks' quarantine if they can show a certified negative coronavirus test.
Among the executives waiting to board the chartered Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) flight to Tianjin was Karin Warowski, a controller at carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), who was eager to rejoin her husband after months of separation.
""Obviously everyone's pleased that business is restarting - it's already underway,"" she said, rushing through a near-deserted airport to catch her flight. 
""I'm one of the first privileged few who can go back to Tianjin... I'm very pleased to be going back to where my husband is. We've been apart for four months.""
About 500 to 1,000 business managers have been offered an accelerated re-entry procedure by the Chinese government, a German business representative told Reuters on Tuesday, with family members bringing the total to around 2,500 people. 
Even as much of the rest of the world economy has shut down to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, which originated in China, factories there have been ramping up production again since the outbreak abated.

China is Germany's most important trading partner by far, with around 206 billion euros ($229 bln) worth of goods traded in 2019.

LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - It took just three days to sell shares in JDE Peet's (AS:JDEP) as investors facing a dearth of opportunities because of the coronavirus-induced slow-down rushed to secure a dose of the world's No. 2 maker of packaged coffee. 
JDE Peet's (AS:JDEP), whose brands include Douwe Egberts, Peet's Coffee and Jacobs, is Europe's biggest initial public offering (IPO) this year. It raised 2.25 billion euros ($2.50 billion) in its market debut on Friday. 
A total of 20 banks are expected to pocket an overall $59.8 million in fees, with global coordinators BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) earning about $6.2 million each, Refinitiv estimates show. 
Strong investor interest from the likes of George Soros' Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Partners prompted JDE to bring forward the deal, which was expected in June. 
Pent-up demand and virtual marketing turned out to be more efficient than traditional roadshows, saving investors' time and potentially paving the way for long-term changes to how IPOs are sold. 
Advisers on the deal started to lure investors early this year before the novel coronavirus brought Europe to a halt, a banking source involved in the work said. 
""The positive reaction of investors gave us the confidence that there would be enough demand for the deal at a reasonable price, even in exceptional circumstances,"" the source said, asking not to be named. 
The process gathered pace over the last three weeks, with virtual roadshows completed in just 72 hours, instead of management travelling for at least a fortnight to meet investors at fancy hotels around the world, two sources close to the deal said. 
Back-to-back calls with management and analysts took place on Webex and other technology platforms, as advisors set up dedicated lines for investors to dial in. 
The largest conference call had 150 investors on the line, one of the sources said. 
For all the success of JDE Peet's, the number of new IPOs is expected to be low this year, with only big companies present in several countries and active in resilient industries likely to attempt a similar float. 

""The market remains very selective,"" a second source said.

988,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 29, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",Consumers Start Feeling More Comfortable,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index(1) rose Thursday for the first time in 10 weeks — ticking up to 35.5 from 34.7. This sliver of positivity is set against the depressing, if not unexpected, fact that the index is down 27.5 points from mid-March, and 31.8 points from a two-decade peak in January. 
A closer look at the data reveals interesting differences in reported comfort between men and women; Republicans and Democrats; and those who didn't graduate from high school and those with a college degree or higher. Curiously, there is little difference between age groups. 
One sign that relationships may not be thriving in lockdown comes from the comfort gap between the married and the single. In May 2019, this gap was 14.1 points, with married people feeling more comfortable; it now stands at just 3.3, with a significant decline for married people.
Although the chasm between the most and least comfortable groups has significantly narrowed as a result of Covid-19, it remains the case that the happiest U.S. consumers are white, Republican, college-educated men who have full-time jobs, own their own homes and enjoy household incomes of over $100,000. Plus ça change.

990,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>","Twitter, internet group oppose U.S. rules requiring visitors to disclose social media info","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), Reddit and a group representing major internet firms backed two documentary film groups that have challenged the Trump Administration's 2019 rules requiring nearly all U.S. visitors to disclose social media user information from the prior five years.
In court papers filed on Thursday, the social media sites and the Internet Association, representing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and others, said the rules force foreign nationals ""to surrender their anonymity in order to travel to the United States"" and ""chill a vast quantity of speech and associational activity.""
The Doc Society and the International Documentary Association filed suit in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., in December. They said they regularly collaborate with non-U.S. filmmakers and warn that visitors must ""consider the risk that a U.S. official will misinterpret their speech on social media, impute others’ speech to them, or subject them to additional scrutiny or delayed processing because of the views they or their contacts have expressed.""
The latest filing comes amid an escalating feud between President Donald Trump and tech companies. Twitter on Friday hid a Trump tweet behind a warning for the first time. It came hours after Trump signed an executive order threatening Silicon Valley social media firms with new free speech regulations, after Twitter added a fact-checking tag to two previous tweets. 
The State Department rules require disclosure of all social media handles used over the prior five years by U.S. visa applicants, including ones under pseudonyms, on 20 platforms.
Applicants must disclose accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Flickr, Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), Myspace, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS), Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vine and Chinese sites Douban, QQ, Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), Tencent Weibo, and Youku; Russian social network VK; Belgian site Twoo; and Latvian site Ask.fm.
The Justice Department has argued in court papers that ""information gleaned from social media profiles can be used to determine activity, ties, or intent that would be grounds for visa denial, including criminal acts.""
The State Department says the rules were prompted by Trump's 2017 order requiring heightened vetting of visa applications. It previously collected contact information, travel history, family information, and prior addresses.

The department receives more than 14 million applicants annually. The only travelers exempted from the social media rules are diplomatic and official travelers.

The company said it would also search for CROs for its commercial, consumer and small business, and investment banking arms and also for its wealth management unit.
Since taking over the scandal-plagued bank late last year, Chief Executive Charlie Scharf has shaken up its leadership and overhauled the bank's business lines.
The bank has had to contend with a federal investigation, a dozen consent orders and an unprecedented Federal Reserve cap on its balance sheet growth as the fallout of a 2016 sales practices scandal. 
The San Francisco-based bank said on Friday the new risk model will have five line-of-business CROs and other teams aligned by risk type, each reporting to Wells Fargo CRO Mandy Norton.
Reen will join Wells Fargo in August. He most recently served as CRO for JPMorgan Chase & Co's (N:JPM) card services business.

Juliano, who most recently served as consumer and business banking CRO and U.S. chief operational risk officer at Santander (MC:SAN) Bank, will join Wells Fargo in July.

995,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Brazil's Embraer draws foreign interest after Boeing rift - sources,"By Marcelo Rochabrun, Sanjeev Miglani and Tim Hepher
SAO PAULO/NEW DELHI/PARIS (Reuters) - Aircraft makers are circling Brazil's Embraer (SA:EMBR3) weeks after Boeing (N:BA) ditched plans for a historic commercial aviation tie-up, people familiar with the matter said.
Boeing axed plans to buy 80% of Embraer's commercial unit in April, ending a planned move into regional jets that mirrored rival Airbus' (PA:AIR) purchase in 2018 of a competing model developed by Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF).
China's state-owned COMAC planemaker has voiced informal interest in co-operation with the world's third-largest jetmaker, two of the people said. Russian aircraft manufacturer Irkut has also explored the issue, two others said, though the company denied any current interest.
India, another rising aerospace power focusing mainly on defence but with a huge civil market, has informally conveyed interest at government level while still studying the matter, sources said.
That places Embraer's fate at the centre of the so-called BRIC group of nations, with each honing aerospace strategies as Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA) reel from the coronavirus crisis.
Embraer shares rose around 8% immediately after publication of the Reuters report, with trading halted momentarily in New York due to excess volatility. 
China's COMAC and the Indian and Brazilian governments did not reply to requests for comment. 
An Irkut spokeswoman denied interest in Embraer. The Brazilian planemaker declined to comment.
Both COMAC and Irkut are developing aircraft to compete directly with Airbus and Boeing in the busy 150-seat market. China's plans are considered the most advanced.
A deal with Embraer would add engineering resources and global support but also clash with smaller and commercially less successful regional jets developed by both countries. 
A Russian industry source said Irkut’s ultimate parent Rostec is focusing on its existing MS-21, designed to compete with Airbus and Boeing, and Superjet regional aircraft.
Although it has invested heavily in parts and maintenance, India is the least visible suitor in commercial aerospace with no active project other than a 14-seater jet dubbed SARAS. 
But India has a potential requirement for developing an 80-90-seat regional jet - a category occupied by Embraer - for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's signature UDAN project to expand air services to small towns. 
Embraer is also seen as a one-off chance to rebalance India's aerospace ambitions against strategic rival China.
R.K. Tyagi, ex-chairman of state-run Hindustan Aeronautics, said he had written to the government urging it to move fast.
""Any country with ambitions will look at this. I feel this is a good opportunity. Valuation is down and if we get control of a modern, proven aircraft programme, it is a big jump.""
Modi administration officials and a government thinktank are preparing a strategy paper on Embraer but no formal approach has yet been made, an official aware of the plans said.
""The situation at Embraer is fairly bad, share value is drastically eroded; there would be many countries showing interest in this including us,"" the official said. 
Although Embraer says it can rebound, aircraft buyers have said it lacks deep enough pockets to counter Airbus's powerful commercial backing for the Canadian-designed A220.
VALUATION
Embraer's jetliner boss said on May 1 the company had not initiated talks with anyone, but that he could not ""legislate for the inbound calls that could come.""
Embraer has said it will consider its next moves carefully. A major headache for the company is a valuation down 64% this year, underperforming the crisis-hit aviation sector.
Embraer may be reluctant to yield to bargain-hunters, but with aviation in shock globally from the pandemic, its options remain limited even though it is the only available full-scale manufacturer, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said.
""Embraer is a fantastic commercial prime (contractor) but very few people are trying to buy a commercial prime,"" he said.
Privatised in the 1990s, Embraer remains close to Brazil's government, which can veto strategic decisions.
Any negotiation with China, Russia or India would require a slow and methodical process to put everyone at ease, said Oliver Stuenkel, a professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation and expert on the BRICS group that since 2010 includes South Africa. 
Tensions with China have risen since Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro took over last year, while Brazil has deepened ties with India in various sectors.
Stuenkel does not expect resistance to China, Russia or India from Brazil's politicians. But he said Bolsonaro might not want to be linked publicly to any talks with China and would likely enlist his vice-president, retired general Hamilton Mourao, who has already backed Embraer having a Chinese partner.
""Bolsonaro does not want to be seen as the one who sold Embraer to the Chinese,"" Stuenkel said. 

Other industry analysts cautioned that while China has discussed buying major aerospace assets in the past, including the Canadian jet that eventually went to Airbus and became the A220, but has completed relatively few acquisitions.

Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said earlier this month that the group would shut down Lauda's main hub in the Austrian capital and bring in Ryanair jets instead unless staff agreed to a pay cut and a new labour agreement.
A Lauda spokeswoman said the shut-down involved the loss of around 370 jobs and comes after Lauda failed to agree a new collective wage deal with the union even after management made a new offer with improved conditions on Thursday. 
Austria's Vida union refused to agree to Lauda's proposals as it said they would hit some staff unacceptably hard. 
""We are fully aware of the fact that you have to make a contribution in times of crisis,"" Roman Hebenstreit, chief of Austria's vida union told radio station ORF on Friday. 
However, having to negotiate contracts that would push the income of employees that work full time and in shifts to below the ""poverty threshold"" was ""out of proportion.""
The union is still willing to negotiate, a vida union spokesman told Reuters. So far no new talks had been agreed upon, he added.
Austian media had reported that some Lauda staff in Vienna has criticised the union for its tough stance.
The Lauda spokeswoman said the company had not managed to pay the May salaries for about 200 staff in Germany after the local labour office had rejected a proposal for reduced work hours. 
""This is an organisational problem, we are working very hard to pay out the wages in the next few days,"" the spokeswoman said.
Ryanair bought the Austrian airline from Former Formula One racing champion Niki Lauda in 2018 as part of a move to a broader structure with several airline brands. 
Lauda's Vienna base last had hosted half of the airline's 30 A320s. O'Leary has said he planned to keep Lauda's other bases in Stuttgart, Dusseldorf and Palma open. 

Many of Lauda's planes have been relocated to bases in London Stansted, Duesseldorf and Palma de Mallorca.

Investing.com -- Gold prices bucked up at the end of a difficult week in which rotation into cyclical assets left havens unloved.
By 11:30 AM ET (1530 GMT), gold futures for delivery on the Comex exchange were up 1.3% at $1,736.00 a troy ounce, while spot gold was up 0.9% at $1,734.58 an ounce. As such, the yellow metal is on track to end the week roughly where it started it. 
Silver futures again outperformed, rising 2.2% to a three-month high of $18.36 an ounce, while platinum futures were 0.3% at $870.95 an ounce. Palladium futures fell 1.0% after  Renault  (PA:RENA) became the second major automaker in as many days to announce big cuts in production capacity, signalling less demand for the metal in the years ahead. 
The downsized Nissan-Renault alliance will have to focus more on electric vehicles, which demand other metals, notably copper. Copper futures, however, have struggled to make headway beyond the $2.40 level, due not least to concerns for Chinese demand as President Donald Trump prepares to chastise the country for what the U.S. sees as ending Hong Kong's autonomy. Trump is due to give a press briefing on new measures against China later. Such details as have leaked out so far do not appear to include meaningful economic sanctions or tariffs, however. 
Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell again played down any suggestion of pushing official interest rates below zero in a video conference with former Fed Vice-Chair Alan Blinder. Analysts suggest the need for more monetary stimulus, which would be bullish for gold, has receded somewhat this week amid signs of the economy reopening. 
Continuing jobless claims fell for the first time since the outbreak of the coronavirus last week, and figures released on Friday showed personal income rising sharply and spending falling just as sharply as consumers were forced into involuntary savings by lockdowns. 
""This is the basis for believing that spending will rebound strongly as lockdowns are eased, but it will also make it easier for Republicans in the Senate to keep pushing back on the idea of further stimulus, for a while at least,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson in a note to clients.
""April spending collapsed across-the-board, with double-digit falls in durable goods, non-durable goods, and services,"" he added. ""This will mark the floor; a host of indicators point clearly to increased spending in May.""

Since the central bank’s unexpected pledge to shore up the wobbly market in March, it has purchased barely $3 billion of corporate debt-tracking funds as of May 26, according to the data released Thursday. That’s just 1.2% of the $252.7 billion market for credit ETFs.
It’s not much of a surprise to investors that the Fed has made only nominal ETF buys, since its announcement alone spurred enough demand to restore order. When credit markets seized up in mid-March, the Fed unleashed a torrent of support. Now its demand for ETFs appears unnecessary: assets in the largest credit ETF has climbed to a record, and investment-grade corporate-debt sales topped $1 trillion just 149 days into the year.
“There’s no need for the Fed to be using all of their firepower now when the market is functioning smoothly,” said Collin Martin, a fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. “The small purchases seem to be another signal, with the Fed saying ‘we’re up and running’ but keeping plenty of powder dry until it needs to really help the market.”
The delay between the announcement and the first purchases had left some speculating that the Fed might not actually use the facility, given the magnitude of the market reaction. The $49 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF has rallied over 14% since March 23, and is leading 2020 fixed-income inflows with an $11.7 billion haul.
Total assets held in the so-called Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, is shown at $34.8 billion in the latest release. However, a note with the release explained that this reflected the U.S. Treasury Department’s equity contribution to the facility to shield the Fed from losses, of which 85% must be invested in non-marketable Treasury securities and reported in the net holdings of the program.

1000,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2020 09:38AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Falls at Open on Profit-Taking; Trump China Briefing Eyed,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Friday on profit-taking after a week of solid gains, as many were content to book profits ahead of a potentially bearish briefing on China by President Donald Trump after the close.
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 145 points, or 0.6%, at 25,257 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% while the Nasdaq Composite outperformed with a 0.2% gain after a recent run of underperforming the more cyclical traditional indices. 
After the close, Trump is expected to announce new U.S. measures to punish China for what the U.S. sees as the suppression of Hong Kong's autonomy through the introduction of a new security law. Any such measures are bound to cause resentment in China, which views the issue as an internal one. 
Data released earlier also kept bulls in check, underlining how difficult it will be to support private consumption against a backdrop of record unemployment. Personal spending fell 13.6% in April, even though personal incomes rose 10.5% with the assistance of massive benefit payments across the country. Cleveland Federal Reserve President Loretta Mester told Bloomberg in an interview that the evidence so far makes it hard to believe in a V-shaped recovery.
Mester's boss, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, is due to speak at 11 AM ET.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 2.6% amid fears that it may suffer Chinese retaliation to whatever Trump announces later, by being placed on China's ""unreliable entity"" list. 
Closer to home, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) stock fell another 3.9% after Trump signed an executive order late on Thursday that aspires to give regulators greater authority over what social media platforms block or flag. Trump has used Twitter copiously this week to express his anger at what he sees as bias after it marked some of his tweets as unreliable. The company doubled down late on Thursday by restricting another tweet of Trump's ""glorifying violence.""
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell by 0.1%. The company has repeated its mantra that it doesn't want to be the arbiter of free speech on its platform.
Other major movers included Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) stock, which fell 5.0% after the software company cut its full-year earnings per share forecast by some 7%. The fact that it still has guidance at all is, however, perhaps hints at an improvement in visibility since the peak of the first-quarter earnings season in April.  Cosmetics maker Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) saw its stock fall 4.3% after a disappointing quarterly report, although analysts at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) actually raised their price target afterwards, citing the group's progress in pivoting to online distribution. 
In other markets, U.S. Crude Oil Futures fell 1.7% to $33.14 a barrel, likewise succumbing to profit-taking after a rally that priced in a speedy rebalancing of the global market. Such hopes seemed a little ambitious in the wake of data on Thursday showing a big rise in U.S. stockpiles, driven not least by a surge in imports.
Gold Futures, meanwhile, corrected upwards by 1.0% to $1,730 a troy ounce.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc on Friday said it would offer rides by the hour in some U.S. cities, a feature aimed at helping Americans with essential trips during the coronavirus pandemic.
The option, which is already available in a handful of cities in Australia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East, will cost $50 per hour. Fares for regular Uber rides are generally based on the level of demand and the trip distance.
Uber said it decided to expand the hourly feature to the U.S. after riders requested an option for extended trips during the pandemic to avoid exposure to different drivers and vehicles when taking multiple trips in a confined time period.
The company said it expected the option to be used for trips to grocery stores, pharmacies and doctors appointments, but would monitor use going forward.
Hourly bookings will be available in Atlanta, Chicago, Washington, Dallas, Houston, Miami, Orlando, Tampa Bay, Philadelphia, Phoenix, Tacoma and Seattle beginning June 2, with expansions planned in the following weeks.
Ride-hailing trips, which generate the bulk of Uber's revenue, dropped 80% globally in April, but the company earlier this month said demand was slowly recovering.
Since May 18, Uber requires riders and drivers around the world to wear face coverings or masks and allows both parties to cancel trips and report users who do not comply with the measure. Repeated failure to comply can lead to account deactivation for both riders and drivers.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) plans to boost its electric push in China, the world's biggest auto market, by pumping 2.1 billion euros in two Chinese electric vehicle players.
The deals come as global rivals such as General Motors (NYSE:GM), Toyota and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc seek to expand electric sales in the Chinese car market. 
Volkswagen said it will invest 1 billion euros to take a 50% stake in the state-owned parent of Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group (JAC Motors), also taking full management control of the its existing electric vehicle joint venture with JAC by raising its stake to 75% from 50%.
Volkswagen's China chief Stephan Woellenstein told reporters on Friday the venture planned to revamp one existing JAC plant and launch its first electric model based on its MEB platform, an architecture enabling efficient production of various EV models, in 2023. 
The joint venture will launch five more electric models by 2025, when the German giant aims to sell 1.5 million new energy vehicles (NEV) - including battery electric cars as well as plug-in hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles - a year in China.
In a separate transaction, Volkswagen will pay 1.1 billion euros to acquire 26.5% of Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd, a maker of electric vehicle batteries, becoming its biggest shareholder. Volkswagen said Guoxuan, based in Hefei like JAC, will supply batteries to its EV models in China.
Woellenstein said Anhui province, where Hefei is located, will be Volkswagen's EV manufacturing hub in China. The Wolfsburg-based automaker has not changed its EV strategy in China after the global gasoline market tumbled, he said. 
He added China's overall auto sales in the second half of this year will be level with same period last year. Volkswagen China's full-year sales will be lower than last year due to the sales loss in the first months.
Reuters exclusively reported on Wednesday that VW was in final talks to invest in the two companies.
China has set a target of 25% of 2025 annual vehicle sales to be made up of NEVs. More than 25 million vehicles were sold in China last year.
Friday's moves also make Volkswagen the latest foreign automaker to increase ownership of operations in China since the government started to relax rules in 2018, with German peer BMW AG quick to take control of its main local venture.
Tesla last year became the first foreign automaker to wholly own a car plant in China.
Volkswagen also has ventures with state-owned China FAW Group Corp Ltd [SASACJ.UL] and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd. 
Shares in both JAC and Guoxuan climbed their maximum daily limit of 10% on Friday morning. Volkswagen's shares fell 3%.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 07:56AM ET</span>","We thought too big, Renault says as it axes 15,000 jobs in cost-cutting reboot","By Gilles Guillaume and Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) acknowledged that its global ambitions had been unrealistic, announcing plans to cut about 15,000 jobs, shrink production and restructure French plants as it pressed the reset button and sought to banish the spectre of Carlos Ghosn.
Faced with a slump in demand that has been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, Renault detailed plans on Friday to find 2 billion euros ($2.22 billion) in savings over the next three years. 
""We thought too big in terms of sales,"" said interim Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos, adding the company was ""coming back to its bases"" after investing and spending too much in recent years.
The French carmaker was under pressure even before COVID-19 hit, posting its first loss in a decade in 2019, and has said nothing would be ""taboo"" as it reviews its business. 
It plans to trim its global capacity to 3.3 million vehicles in 2024 from 4 million now, focusing on its most profitable models and areas such as electric cars while freezing manufacturing expansion in countries like Romania.
Renault, like its Japanese alliance partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY), is rowing back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by Ghosn, its former boss-turned-fugitive, who is wanted on charges of financial misconduct in Tokyo. Ghosn denies the charges. 
""The mindset has completely changed. The previous line was volumes and sales and being the first on the podium,"" Delbos said. ""We're not looking to be on top of the world, what we want is a sustainable and profitable company.""
The company, due to bring ex-Volkswagen executive Luca de Meo on board as CEO in July, said it would cut costs by reducing the number of subcontractors in areas such as engineering and the number of components it uses, as well as shrinking gearbox manufacturing worldwide.
Delbos ruled out the need for a rights issue, saying Renault was close to sealing a 5 billion-euro credit line guaranteed by the French government. 
Renault shares were down 5% by 0820GMT, the worst performing stock on France's blue-chip index. 
THIRD OF CUTS IN FRANCE
Renault, which is 15% owned by the French state, faces the most sensitive restructuring measures in its home country, which will shoulder almost a third of the global job cuts and faces potential plant closures.
The carmaker said it was in talks with unions. Six sites out of Renault's 14 plants in France - including a component factory in Brittany and the Dieppe factory where the group's Alpine cars are made - will be under review, though most changes would take effect after 2022, Delbos said. 
Some of the six plants like the one in Flins, close to Paris, where it makes its electric Zoe models, could cease to assemble cars and centre on recycling activities instead, the company said. 
The government has said it will not sign off on the state-backed loan until management and unions conclude talks over jobs and factories in France. It is seeking further clarity on how some big factories will be reorganised and further guarantees on jobs before it gives the green light, according to a source familiar with the matter. 
In all just under 10% of its global workforce will be affected by layoffs, and restructuring measures will cost 1.2 billion euros. There will be about 4,600 job cuts in France, though Renault said it would prioritise employment transfers, voluntary departures and retirement schemes. 
French unions expressed frustration.
""This plan is unbalanced, at the expense of French activities,"" the moderate CFDT union said on Friday, adding that other countries had been less affected. 
GETTING OVER GHOSN? 
Renault is still struggling to move on from the scandal involving Ghosn, which strained its relations with alliance partner Nissan and paralysed joint projects.
Ghosn, who ran Renault and was the chief architect of the alliance, was arrested in Japan in late 2018 on financial misconduct charges, but fled to Lebanon in December. He has denied wrongdoing and hit out at his past employers.
Renault and Nissan have been hit hard by the pandemic just as they were trying to rework their partnership. Nissan this week also outlined a plan to become smaller and more efficient. 
They were among the weakest global automakers going into the crisis, lacking a clear plan for using their alliance to emerge from the slump and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles and other technology.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Pandemic saps union clout as talks loom with Chile copper miners,"By Fabian Cambero
SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's powerful copper unions are headed into contract talks with a hand weakened by the coronavirus pandemic, giving an edge to miners like Codelco,  Glencore  (OTC:GLNCY) and  Antofagasta  in negotiations that could influence wages and benefits for years.
Chile's generally well-paid copper mine workers argue they should be adequately compensated for working in a riskier environment to keep pits open during the pandemic.
Their position has not found much support, even in a country that was already racked by protests over inequality before the coronavirus hit. Union leaders said it would be harder to achieve wage hikes, bonuses and benefit boosts now that the pandemic has swept through the global copper market and hit profits for miners in Chile, the world's top producer.
Even the timetables for talks, which differ for each miner and its unions, could slip as companies push to delay the renegotiation of expired contracts until the country emerges from coronavirus lockdown.
""Obviously we are not engaged in collective bargaining at the moment, we are engaged with coronavirus,"" Felipe Román, head of the union at Collahuasi, a joint venture of  Anglo American  (L:AAL) and Glencore (L:GLEN), told Reuters.
""And when it comes to the point of negotiating contracts, that will be pretty tough.""
Chile's miners, plagued by falling ore grades, were already looking to shave costs and boost efficiency during a prolonged period of floundering prices for the red metal. The coronavirus has hardened their resolve. 
The copper price plunged to a four-year low in March as demand fell from China, the world's largest consumer of the red metal and the country first hit by the pandemic. The sinking returns have weighed heavily on balance sheets. 
Prices have regained some ground as China begins to reopen. However, unions in Chile acknowledge they may not be able to get the usual contract sweeteners.
""That is the subject of the discussion. We always go with a position adapted to the situation that is being experienced,"" said Guillermo Esquivel, head of the union at Antofagasta's (L:ANTO) Zaldívar mine.
""Expectations have to be measured,"" he added saying that so far there had been no proposal to advance the talks.
In some recent negotiations, Codelco and others have been trying to reduce expensive perks such as pricey health care plans that often extend to retirement.
Several copper miners have postponed projects to improve ore grades and shore up future production and profits, and analysts said these companies may be less willing to consider performance bonuses or maintain health coverage or other hard-won benefits for workers.
Antofagasta, Collahuasi and Codelco declined to comment on the upcoming contract talks. 
BIG BONUSES
The sector has largely remained operational, with measures including distancing and fewer, but longer, shift periods to reduce travel to-and-from the mines.
""Low copper prices and reduced shifts have further complicated the scenario in a country already in crisis,"" said Alejandra Wood, executive director at Chilean think tank the Center for Copper and Mining Studies (CESCO).
""Perhaps, for that reason, a space has opened up in which we won't see these several million (peso) bonuses anymore."" 
Wider fears over increased levels of automation by miners keen to boost productivity has also put unions on the defensive.
The talks may also get pushed back by the virus, with the industry firmly behind proposed legislation to delay talk on any contracts that expired during the quarantine until 60 days after the end of a state of catastrophe declared on March 19. 
Miners believe that failure to pass that bill could risk holding up talks even further and undermine the ""key"" mediator role of the government-appointed Labor Directorate, said Diego Hernandez, head of industry body Sonami, which represents mining companies operating in Chile.
""Failure to adopt this sort of measures would risk stalling negotiations,"" he said.
The workers are split over a delay. Opponents include the Mining Federation, which brings together most private mining unions, but other labor leaders say a delay could stop companies from using the ""pandemic effect"" as a negotiating tool.
For now, the union resistance and a lack of political consensus are holding up the bill. Government leaders are keen for the two sides to reach an accord to prevent debilitating strikes like ones that crippled Chile's copper sector in the past.

""We hope that workers, union leaders and companies can reach agreements that benefit both parties, as has been done in recent years,"" Mining Minister Baldo Prokurica told Reuters.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Global funds recommended trimming bonds and keeping equity allocations on hold at a seven-month low this month even with world stocks on a tear, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.
Asset managers were almost evenly split on whether this year's lows for key indexes would be revisited, in contrast to a Reuters poll of market strategists published on Thursday which showed most on the sell-side don't expect that to happen.[EPOLL/WRAP]
After the March mayhem -- driven by fears the global economy would plummet into recession due to the coronavirus, which has infected over 5.8 million people -- global stocks have rallied on hopes unparalleled global stimulus would drive a strong and quick V-shaped recovery.
But fund managers and economists have consistently said the recovery would be either U-shaped, with a prolonged trough, or like a tick mark where the rebound is not as powerful or as fast as the initial drop. [ECILT/WRAP]
The May 12-28 Reuters poll of 35 fund managers and chief investment officers in the United States, Europe and Japan showed equity allocations accounted for 45.1% of the model global portfolio, unchanged from April's seven-month low.
""We do not favor equities, given the V-shaped rebound that is currently priced in by markets, as there is nothing at the moment supporting that sentiment,"" said a global chief investment officer at a large U.S. fund management company.
""The latest rally we believe is driven more by the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus, but that is at best going to stop the economic malaise and we think it is going to be a very long and painful recovery for most economies.""
Fund managers also warned most asset prices look expensive following an rally in stocks and bonds this year. They recommended a cut to bond holdings for the first time since January, to 42.4% from 43.3% in the previous month.
""The continuation of bond buying from the central banks is creating a bubble of concern going forward,"" said Peter Lowman, chief investment officer at Investment Quorum in London.
""Clearly, with the Federal Reserve showing they are prepared to do whatever it takes to kick start their economy, it is very supportive for global equity markets over bonds on a risk-adjusted basis.""
When asked if global stock markets would revisit their 2020 lows, fund managers were almost evenly split, with 10 expecting that to happen, while the remaining 11 said they would not.
""The stock market is currently sending mixed messages, on one hand defensive and growth equities have rallied but on the other, cyclical equities which tend to lead a recovery have remained suppressed,"" said Benjamin Suess, director at UBS Asset Management.
""What matters is whether we will see significant second waves (of the virus) and thus renewed mobility restrictions and a slowdown of economic activity. Clearly, the policy reaction to the second wave will also be important to reduce second round effects.""
A majority of fund managers responding to an additional question said pandemic headlines and stimulus would be the main driver of equity markets over the next three months.
""As we are entering into the second phase of the crisis with the gradual reopening of global economies, we maintain a cautious stance in terms of global allocation, said Kevin Thozet, a member of the investment committee at Carmignac.

""Moving out of lockdowns does not mean a return to normality and we expect significant divergence across regions, countries, and sectors to continue to prevail, and very much dependent on the variety of exit strategies and stimulus provided to support the economies.""

1008,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Wall Street Week Ahead: Investors eye consumer discretionary stocks as U.S. reopens,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are taking a closer look at the market's consumer discretionary companies as a reopening U.S. economy fuels hopes of a turnaround for some of the sector's hardest-hit names.
Many companies in the sector have been battered by the country-wide coronavirus-fueled lockdowns that have weighed on growth and damaged retail spending over the last several months, though the stocks of a few, like Amazon, have soared. 
A gradual lifting of lockdowns in some states has stirred hopes for a bounce back for the retailers that make up much of the sector.
Some investors, however, say it may be months before consumers return to their previous shopping habits, making it unlikely that the companies will see a pickup in revenues in the near term. 
Firms ranging from middle-income retailers such as Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) N> and  American Eagle Outfitters  Inc (N:AEO) to high-end destinations like  Tiffany & Co  (N:TIF) and  Vail Resorts Inc  (N:MTN) are expected to report results in the week ahead. 
""This particular group is full of landmines,"" said Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group. ""There is not going to be a lot of investor follow-through until we get some certainty with what future revenue prospects are going to be."" 
Shares of the Gap, for instance, are down 43% for the year to date. A recession that persists through the fourth quarter of this year would reduce the company's revenues by 40%, according to a note by research firm Trefis. 
Next Friday’s U.S. jobs report is expected to show that the unemployment rate rose to 19.8% in May, smashing April’s record 14.7%, according to a Reuters poll. Non-farm payrolls are expected to drop by 7.4 million, adding to the 20.5 million jobs lost the previous month.
Cox is focusing on dominant players such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT), which have a mix of essential items such as groceries as well as electronics and games that can appeal to customers who may face extended lockdowns during a potential second wave of the virus. 
Overall, retail companies in the S&P 500 are up 12.9% for the year to date, a gain powered largely by Amazon's 31% rally. Apparel companies, by comparison, are down 16.2% over the same time. 
Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Asset Management Multi-Asset Solutions team, says retail companies will likely show rising expenses over the next several quarters due to items like more frequent sanitation of stores and technology purchases aimed at increasing the productivity of employees working from home. 
""It's really going to be a challenge to get a clear read of the direction for quite a while,"" he said. 
Despite those headwinds, investors may still gravitate toward companies that are able either to tap the capital markets for funds or draw from their financial reserves, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives with the Schwab Center for Financial Research. 
Retailers such as J. Crew and J.C. Penney have already filed for bankruptcy due in part to the coronavirus pandemic, leaving more opportunity for companies that are able to survive and grab market share, said Frederick. 
""You're getting set up for potential upside surprises,"" he said. ""You may take a step back and look at this and say, 'No matter how awful these numbers may be, at least they're still in business.'""

1009,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>",Stocks - US Futures Lower; Consolidating Ahead of Trump Speech,"By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Friday, consolidating ahead of a key statement from President Donald Trump about his administration’s response to China strengthening its grip on Hong Kong.
At 07:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 8 points, or 0.3%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 19 points, or 0.2%. The Dow Futures contract fell 102 points, or 0.4%. 
Despite this expected weak start to trading Friday, all three cash indices are set to post their second straight positive month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on track for its best weekly gain in seven weeks.
U.S. President Donald Trump will hold a news conference later Friday detailing his administration’s response after China's parliament Thursday pressed ahead with national security legislation for Hong Kong.
American relations with Beijing have been on edge since the Covid-19 pandemic reared its head, and a possible response could see Washington withdrawing Hong Kong’s special status, which has underpinned the city as a global financial hub.
Elsewhere, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), and the other social media giants, will be in focus after it hid one of President Trump’s tweets behind a warning that it “glorifies violence”, further escalating the social media company’s row with the U.S. president.
It came just hours after he signed an executive order threatening Silicon Valley social media firms with new regulations over free speech.
Those looking for a broader look on the economy will get to hear from the head of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, at 11 AM ET (15:00 GMT) in a public webcast.
Attention of late has been on the possibility of negative interest rates, which Powell has largely dismissed, but he may now face questions on the likely restart of large-scale bond-buying and promises about how long it might continue.
Additionally, data on personal income and spending are due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists predict that personal income in April fell 6.5% and that spending plunged 12.6% - both would be record declines.
At 10 AM ET, the University of Michigan will issue its final measure of May consumer confidence, and the sentiment index is expected to tick up to 74.
The crude oil market sold off Friday, after the Energy Information Administration data detailed a surprise add of 7.9 million barrels to inventories, backing up Wednesday’s report by the American Petroleum Institute, and reviving doubts about output discipline by suppliers.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.4% lower at $32.59 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.8% to $35.01.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.7% to $1,726.10/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.1130, up 0.5%.

(Reuters) - When Yahaira Caraballo opened her nail salon in the Bronx, New York nearly seven years ago, it was a bare-bones shop with two nail technicians.
Earlier this year, she had six nail technicians, a full-time receptionist and a cleaning person, a renovated salon, and a following that included as many as 45 clients on a busy day.
Now Caraballo, 38, doesn't know how long it will be before her clients can once again sit side by side at her black shimmery nail bar for manicures, or on her salon's long studded bench to have pedicures.
""We were pretty successful prior to this,"" said Caraballo. She's running the numbers to calculate if she can operate at half her usual capacity - the level she estimates will allow for enough space between customers to meet social distancing guidelines. ""It will have to work one way or the other, even if I have to cut some expenses or inventory."" 
She is still waiting for clearance from city and state officials to reopen her salon, which has been shuttered since late March when New York closed down all nonessential businesses to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
After that happens, there's the question of how many people will show up. Traffic had slowed to below half the usual pace even before the lockdown, as people became more nervous about becoming infected with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Caraballo is one of millions of small U.S. business owners trying to adapt to survive the aftermath of the pandemic. Reuters will follow several over the next 12 months as they face crowd restrictions, reduced demand and public health concerns. 
Caraballo hopes to re-open in mid-June with plastic shields at the nail bar to create a barrier between technicians and clients. Customers will be welcome by appointment only and Caraballo plans to have the salon professionally cleaned at least twice a month. 
She is not counting on getting much help. 
Her landlord offered to create a rent payment plan once the salon reopens, because she is two months behind. But she hasn't been able to tap a loan from the federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), after applying twice. 
Part of the $2.9 trillion economic relief package passed by Congress, PPP loans are meant to help small businesses keep employees on their staff. 
Some minority business owners like Caraballo, who moved to New York from the Dominican Republic more than 20 years ago, have struggled to access the aid.
About four in ten beauty salons who applied for PPP loans did not receive them, the Professional Beauty Association, a trade group, found https://www.probeauty.org/docs/default-source/advocacy-documents/fica/pba_salonemployerpppsurvey_.pdf.
The federal government tried to reach more minority groups in a second round of PPP loans, by reserving $30 billion out of the $310 billion pool for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. The government also set aside $10 billion in funds for Community Development  Financial Institutions  (NASDAQ:FISI), which are more likely to have relationships with minority-owned businesses and those in rural areas.
The first time Caraballo applied, through her accountant, she was told the funds were depleted. She has not heard back from her lender after a second application a month ago. 
A loan of $15,000 to $25,000 would help her pay for rent, a deep cleaning, payroll and other debts. ""I don't even know if this is going to be over soon,"" she said. ""I feel helpless in a way.""
Caraballo estimates her new monthly revenue may average $14,000, half what she could make before the crisis. After paying a 60% sales commission to her nail techs, nearly $3,000 a month for rent and about $2,500 for utilities and other costs, it will be tough to break even. 

""Hopefully it will get better,"" she said. ""We can only be optimistic.""

1013,By Investing.com,"<span>May 29, 2020 05:37AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Smelling the Coffee in Times of Coronavirus,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Seizing the day or a sign of things to come?
JDE Peet’s, the world second-largest seller of packaged coffee, has pulled off Europe’s largest initial public offering of the year to date, in record time, with substantial oversubscription and some highly reputable anchor investors.
The 2.25 billion-euro ($2.5 billion) offering was snapped up eagerly on Friday, with investors pushing the stock over 10% higher on its debut in Amsterdam, in what looked at first glance at a fairly expert exploitation of what may still prove to be a brief window of investor optimism between waves of pandemics, seasoned with a dash of trade war.
The clearest statement the deal makes is that at a time of unprecedented uncertainty, there is very strong demand for companies with simple, proven business models. Fast-moving, frequently purchased, daily essential products are a good business to be in right now, and the market is prepared to put an increasing premium on reliable cash flows.  JDE made 585 million euros on 6.9 billion in sales last year, a margin that compares very favorably with the likes of more diversified rivals such as Nestle and Unilever (NYSE:UL).
Demand gets even stronger if, as in this case, you can show that you’re strengthening your balance sheet at the same time: some 700 million euros was sold in the form of new shares, which will pay down debt. Selling shareholders JAB and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) will pocket the rest but will keep control of the company with stakes of 62% and 23.4% respectively.
A couple of months ago, it would have been hard to sell JDE as a growth stock – except in as much as the emerging world will slowly increase its consumption – but a developed-market workforce working from home rather than from offices or their local coffee shop makes arguably changes that calculus in JDE’s favor too. Almost 80% of its sales are through supermarkets.
Just as eye-catching is the way in which the deal has been managed: BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) managed to sell the deal through an entirely virtual marketing process, stripped of any of the expensive ballyhoo of roadshows. Other companies wanting to come to market will see an opportunity to cut the costs of doing so.
The good reception for the deal wasn’t enough, however, to keep European markets from selling off at the end of a roaringly good week.  By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 1.2%, but still on course for a gain of over 3% over the last five days.
The German DAX index was likewise down 1.5%, while the CAC 40 was down 1.1%, weighed down by carmaker Renault’s decision to cut 15,000 jobs and 20% of its capacity in an effort to navigate the post-Coronavirus world.

The automaker, seeking to return to profitability and stop bleeding cash, has secured 350 billion yen from its biggest lender, Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411), of which 200 billion is backed by the state, the sources told Reuters on Friday.
Among other lenders, the Development Bank of Japan will loan 180 billion yen, while Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group (T:8306) will lend 120 billion yen, the people said on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. 
Mitsui Sumitomo will lend 50 billon yen, along with some additional U.S. dollar-denominated funding, they added. 
Nissan announced the total funding amount on Thursday but did not name the lenders. 
All four banks declined to comment on the funding breakdown. Only the Mizuho loan is partly backed by the government, the sources said.
Nissan also announced a four-year recovery plan on Thursday. Japan's No. 2 automaker pledged to slice 300 billion yen in from annual fixed costs and become a smaller, more efficient company after the pandemic exacerbated a slide in profitability that culminated in its first annual loss in 11 years.
Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said the company had ample cash, untapped credit lines and fresh funding to ride out a severe sales slump caused by the coronavirus, but warned the biggest challenge was to improve the company's cash flow. 
Nissan is grappling with a negative free cash flow of 641 billion yen as of the year ended March 31, which the company expects to turn positive in the second half of its financial year.

Still, Uchida and Chief Financial Officer Stephen Ma acknowledged that more funding might be needed if the pandemic continues to weigh on sales in the coming months.

Malaysian stocks are set to enter bull territory as glove makers extend their record rally.
The FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index gained 0.9% as of 4:08 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, extending its gain from a low in March to more than 20%. The country is home to the world’s biggest glove makers  Top Glove Corporation Bhd  (KL:TPGC) and  Hartalega Holdings Bhd  (KL:HTHB), which have surged in recent weeks due to rising demand for protective equipment during the global coronavirus pandemic.
Malaysia follows peers including Indonesia and Philippines that entered technical bull markets last month. It was only in February that Malaysia’s benchmark index ended a 12-year bull run as a sudden change of government and slowing growth outlook sent stocks tumbling more than 20% from its high.
The country has since reported a surprise expansion in the first quarter, unveiled a $60 billion stimulus package and allowed nearly all business sectors to reopen from early May, which are set to bolster the economy. It has also seen a decrease in the number of new coronavirus cases despite a two-day surge in infections among migrant workers earlier this week. Malaysia added just 10 new cases on Thursday, the least since March 12.
If Malaysia can continue to see lower double-digit or even single-digit daily increases in cases, the government may ease more of the lockdown restrictions that have been in place since March, Director-General of Health Noor Hisham Abdullah said on Thursday.
The rally in Malaysia’s stocks comes as foreign investors have continued to sell their holdings to bring this year’s outflow to more than $3 billion. It’s domestic retail investors that have bought into the market amid low interest rates, said Danny Wong Teck Meng, chief executive officer at Areca Capital Sdn.
“With more retail investors participating in trading, we expect volumes to stay, though expect herd mentality,” he said. “In the longer run, second half of this year would show better prospects than first half.”
Other top gainers on Friday included CIMB Group Holdings Bhd (KL:CIMB), which rose 5% and Sime Darby Bhd (OTC:SMEBF), which gained 3.8%.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>","Coffee maker JDE Peet's valued at $17.3 billion in virtual IPO, shares surge","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Shares in coffee maker JDE Peet's surged almost 13% in their stock market debut on Friday as investors jumped on one of the few big IPOs launched during the coronavirus crisis.
Shares in the world's No. 2 maker of packaged coffee, whose brands include Douwe Egberts, Peet's Coffee and Jacobs, were priced at 31.50 euros, valuing the firm at 15.6 billion euros ($17.3 billion). They were trading at 35.55 euros by 0755 GMT.
JDE Peet's raised 700 million euros through the sale of new shares, which it plans to use to pay down debt. Existing shareholders Acorn, controlled by German investor JAB Holding, and Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ), sold an additional 1.55 billion euros worth of stock, for a total of 2.25 billion euros. That represents a 16.5% stake in the company.
JDE Peet's decision to go public despite the IPO market being largely closed since the coronavirus outbreak began to gather steam in March has proved a winning bet.
The offer drew big-name cornerstone investors, notably George Soros's Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Partners and Fidelity Management and Research (FMR).
“We are thrilled to price this offer on Euronext Amsterdam during this extraordinary time,"" said CEO Casey Keller in a statement.
""Seeing the investor interest in JDE Peet’s reinforces the belief in our strategy and solidifies our role as a global leader in coffee and tea.""
Safety concerns and restrictions on travel meant that pre-listing road shows took place in digital-only format. High demand for the offer meant that bankers were able to wrap up in less than two weeks a process that usually takes more than a month.
JDE Peet's, which competes with Nestle and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and also owns the Pickwick, Senseo, Tassimo, TiOra and L'OR brands, had revenue of 6.9 billion euros in 2019, with the bulk of its products sold to supermarkets and businesses. It also operates retail chain stores including well-known U.S. brand Peet's. Net profit in 2019 was 585 million euros.

JAB continues to control the company via Acorn, which will have a 62% stake. Mondelez will hold 23.4%. BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) acted as joint global coordinators on the deal.

1018,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 03:55AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Barrick offers PNG landowners a stake to resolve Porgera mine dispute,"By Tom Westbrook and Melanie Burton
SINGAPORE/MELBOURNE (Reuters) -  Barrick Gold Corp  (TO:ABX) has offered an extra 15% stake in its Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea to local landowners, according to a letter from its CEO, in a bid to break an impasse with the national government over the mine's future.
Barrick, the world's second-largest gold miner, was last month refused an extension of its expired lease over the mine that has been troubled by social unrest and pollution concerns.
Any deal would be the first struck by a resources company under economic nationalist prime minister, James Marape, who came to power a year ago seeking to retain a bigger share of the country's resource riches. Talks between the government and  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) over a gasfield broke down in February, leaving a proposed $13 billion gas project expansion in limbo, while Australia's Newcrest Mining Ltd (AX:NCM) is in talks on a major gold project.
The government's position on Barrick's offer is unclear. Marape's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment and he has previously expressed a desire for the state to operate the mine itself.
Barrick is challenging the rejection of its lease extension in court. However, negotiations have also proceeded via back-channels after Marape, appointed the district's local member, Tomait Kapili, as a go-between.
""In light of the Prime Minister's positive engagement through you, we would like to go further and improve the equity portion of the ... offer to 15% free equity, for a total of 20% equity to be held by the PNG side including the 5% currently owned,"" Barrick's chief executive officer Mark Bristow wrote to Kapili last week, in a letter reviewed by Reuters.
Kapili does not have the authority to accept or refuse the offer because Marape appointed him only to deal with matters relating to local landowners, a separate letter from Marape to Kapili and reviewed by Reuters showed.
Kapili and Barrick did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. A spokesperson for the joint venture, Barrick Niugini Ltd (BNL), declined to comment because the case was before court. 
Barrick and China's  Zijin Mining  Group (SS:601899) each own 47.5% of the Porgera mine high in mountainous Enga province, about 600 km (375 miles) north-west of the capital Port Moresby. The remaining 5% interest is held by landowners through Mineral Resources Enga.
Bristow's letter added that Barrick was willing to further increase the landowners' equity stake, but only if other terms such as corporate taxes were relaxed.
He said over the 20-year mine life, PNG would receive $4.7 billion in cash flow, compared with $3.5 billion for the joint venture, based on a long term gold price of $1,300 an ounce. Gold prices hit 7.5-year highs above $1,750 an once this month. 
The mine contributed about 208 million kina ($60 million) to Papua New Guinea's government income in 2018, according to a report by extractive industry transparency group EITI - roughly 1.5% of government revenue in that year.
Bristow also said the decision to refuse the lease extension had ""stunned"" his company, forced it to halt production and ""created significant liabilities and potentially material damages to Zijin and Barrick.""
Operations at the mine have stopped and PNG's National Court is due to rule on Wednesday on whether Barrick's court challenge to the lease extension refusal can proceed.

1019,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 29, 2020 03:54AM ET</span>",Peet’s Coffee IPO Raises $2.5 Billion ,"(Bloomberg) -- JDE Peet’s BV jumped in Amsterdam trading after the coffee giant raised 2.3 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in just 10 days to become Europe’s biggest initial public offering this year.
The stock climbed 14% to 35.99 euros at 9:01 a.m. in Amsterdam. The company, carved out of the Reimann family’s investment firm JAB Holding Co., priced its shares at 31.50 euros each, according to a statement Friday, in the upper half of the range of 30 euros to 32.35 euros at which the offering was marketed. That gave the company a market value of 15.6 billion euros.
On Thursday, JDE Peet’s said it would close the book early after just three days of taking orders in the IPO, citing “strong demand” from investors, with shares to start trading on Friday. By condensing the customary four-week listing process in Europe to just 10 days, JDE Peet’s minimized its exposure to potential market swings and economic turmoil in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
The pandemic has upended the traditional IPO process, with shorter subscription periods, more cornerstone investors and virtual meetings to pitch the offerings to investors. Cornerstone investors, including funds run by billionaire George Soros’s firm, are taking up a third of JDE Peet’s offering.
Investor orders for the IPO exceeded the number of shares being sold by multiple times at the offer price, with strong demand from institutional investors globally, JDE Peet’s said in the statement.
JDE Peet’s sold 22.2 million new shares, raising 700 million euros in gross proceeds. Shareholders  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ). and Acorn Holdings, a company owned by JAB and other investors, sold existing shares for about 1.55 billion euros.
The IPO brings to market a company that had sales of 6.9 billion euros last year and owns well-known supermarket brands including Douwe Egberts, Jacobs and Kenco as well as U.S. retailers Peet’s and Intelligentsia. JAB created the company through a series of acquisitions, capped by the combination in December of Jacobs Douwe Egberts and Peet’s.
“This company has been IPO-ready for a long time now,” said Gavin Launder, a fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management. JDE Peet’s is attractive because it’s in one of the faster-growing consumer staples sectors, offers steady growth and is targeting a high dividend payout, he said. JDE Peet’s said it aims to pay 50% to 60% of each year’s earnings in dividends.
Coffee consumption has remained resilient during the pandemic, moving from offices and cafes into people’s homes, according to JDE Peet’s, which bills itself as the world’s largest pure-play coffee group.
JDE Peet’s offering has raised hopes that the European IPO market, expected to be shut for the better part of the year amid the pandemic, could reopen earlier than initially expected. So far, listings in the region have been limited to a small group of companies either boosted by or experiencing little disruption from the lockdowns caused by the pandemic.
Recent firms to have braved virus-related turmoil with an IPO have been rewarded by investors. Video-conferencing company Pexip Holding ASA (OL:PEXIP) shot up in its Oslo debut this month, trading 37% up on the IPO price, while data management provider  Exasol Ag  (DE:EXL) has risen 36% since listing in Frankfurt on Monday. German drug-maker PharmaSGP GmbH is also preparing to try its luck soon.

Investing.com - European stock markets sold off Friday, amid nervousness over increasing Sino-U.S. tensions and ahead of President Donald Trump’s response to China's tightening of its control over the city of Hong Kong, a major financial hub.
At 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.5% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 1.3%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1.0%. 
American relations with Beijing have been on edge since the Covid-19 pandemic reared its head, and President Trump is set to hold a news conference later on Friday after China's parliament on Thursday pressed ahead with new national security legislation for Hong Kong, raising fears over the future of its democratic freedoms.
A fresh trade war between the two largest economies in the world would place European governments in a difficult position over how to respond as they shift from battling the coronavirus to economic recovery, where trade with China is likely to play a big part.
Ahead of President Trump’s statement, economic news out of Europe showed some improvement, admittedly from a low base. 
France's economy contracted less than initially thought in the first quarter, with the euro zone's second biggest-economy contracting 5.3% in the first three months of the year from the previous quarter, INSEE said, revising its initial estimate of a 5.8% fall.
Also, German retail sales dropped by 5.3% in April, falling at their fastest pace since 2007, but the reading was much better than the 12% fall widely expected.
In corporate news,  Renault  (PA:RENA) slumped 3.5% after the French carmaker announced it would cease assembling vehicles at several plants in France as it cuts some 15,000 jobs worldwide.
AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) climbed 1.4% after the drug maker reported strong results for a Phase III trial of its Tagrisso lung-cancer drug. 
Elsewhere, JDE Peet’s stock jumped 11% at the start of trading on Euronext in Amsterdam, after the world’s No. 2 maker of packaged coffee became one of the few big companies to go public during the coronavirus crisis. 
Oil prices were under pressure Friday, after government data showed late Thursday an unexpected rise in U.S. inventories of 7.9 million barrels, backing up Wednesday’s report by the American Petroleum Institute.
At 3:50 AM ET, Crude Oil WTI futures traded 3% lower at $32.69 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.4% to $35.16.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>",Crisis-hit Wall Street checks in to Zandi's 'impairment studio',"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Wall Street doesn't know where the world economy is heading, it books a session at Mark Zandi's ""impairment studio"".
Faced with a pandemic-fueled recession with few historical comparisons and a new accounting rule requiring lenders to total up expected losses even before borrowers default, scores of U.S. banks are relying on forecasts from Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Analytics, to help with their calculations.
The exercise is critical to billions of dollars in quarterly earnings and one that, depending on the actions of regulators, could hit capital levels enough to choke a recovery.
""It feels like we're in the center of the universe,"" Zandi, 61, told Reuters. ""But, at the moment, the economy is at the center of everything.""
Even Zandi, who has been in economic forecasting for 30 years and has made countless appearances before Congress as an expert witness, says he was thrown by the coronavirus crisis.
He scrambled to update forecasts for the U.S. economy as countries around the world went into lockdown.
""March was an incredibly difficult month,"" said the economist, who is widely quoted in the U.S. media and a familiar face on business channel CNBC.
Moody's Analytics, a unit of Moody’s Corp, says some 170 institutions around the globe get forecasts from Zandi and his team through a product called ""ImpairmentStudio,"" a platform that helps clients calculate what their loan losses might be based on a range of different economic forecasts. 
At least 59 U.S. lenders, including Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Corp,, the country's eighth biggest by assets, and smaller lenders have said they used Moody's scenarios, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods research shows.
While bigger lenders have stayed mum about Moody's, a bank economist who declined to be named said they check their numbers against Zandi's forecasts.
The chief financial officer of a regional bank, who asked not to be named, added: ""We get the benefit of our analysts knowing what we are doing because we are in the pack using Moody's.
""The product is pretty good and it is as close to a standard as exists.""
Zandi's reputation as an independent-minded economist also helps. He has testified before congress more times than he can remember and, despite working on a presidential bid by the late Republican John McCain, was considered by President Obama as a contender to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2013.
""He's not out there cheerleading and he's not doing gloom,"" said a second banker, who declined to be named.
MULTIPLE SCENARIOS
The pandemic struck just as the new accounting standard kicked in. The old one allowed lenders to wait to write-down values until losses were clear. That delay had led to doubts about banks' strength during the last financial crisis.
Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co increased their reserves for loan losses by $16 billion in the first quarter, pulverizing profits.
During earnings calls, analysts pressed for details on which economic forecasts banks had used. 
For those that acknowledged using Moody's, the analysts wanted to know, for example, if they had closed their books using Zandi’s March 27 updated baseline forecast that showed second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product falling at an annual rate of 18%. And, had they made adjustments or blended in any of Moody's more pessimistic or optimistic scenarios?
Answers were vague.
Since then, Zandi’s mid-April forecast showed the second-quarter rate of GDP at -30% and mid-May at -33%.
Analysts will be watching for the mid-June forecast for possible indications of additional loss expenses in the second quarter, said Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW.
The new accounting rule says banks must use ""reasonable and supportable"" forecasts, but there is a lot of flexibility on what scenarios they adopt and the choice can be material.
A Moody’s study in April applied one of its more optimistic scenarios to a sample of commercial real estate loans and found expected credit losses would be 25% less than its base case scenario. A more pessimistic scenario resulted in 290% greater losses.

""Given the high amount of uncertainty in the economy, it turns out you can come up with multiple scenarios and they are all reasonable and supportable,"" Kleinhanzl said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Stock markets dipped and safe-havens such as bonds and Japan's yen firmed on Friday, as investors awaited Washington's response to China tightening control over the city of Hong Kong.
China's parliament on Thursday pressed ahead with national security legislation for the city, raising fears over the future of its freedoms and function as a finance hub.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed a tough response, said he will hold a news conference on China later on Friday. Trepidation about a further deterioration in Sino-U.S. relations sent stocks lower and put investors on edge.
European futures were in the red, with FTSE futures down 0.7% and EuroSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) 1% lower. Futures for the S&P 500 slipped 0.2%.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1%. The Nikkei (N225) retreated slightly from a three-month high and, though moves were small, the safe-haven yen rose to a two-week high and bonds rose.
""It is seen as a major threat to the rally we've had and the recovery,"" said Shane Oliver, chief economist at Australian wealth manager AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital.
The possible U.S. response could range from a tearing up of the Phase 1 trade deal and fresh tariffs on China, to milder travel or financial sanctions on Chinese officials, he said.
""If it's at the relatively mild end, then I don't think it would derail the recovery bull market, but if it's at the more extreme end with tariffs and harsh treatment of Hong Kong, then I think it gets more problematic,"" Oliver said.
Trump offered a muted response to Hong Kong's mass democracy protests last year while prioritising a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But ties with Beijing have since soured considerably through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Hong Kong's government warned on Friday that withdrawing its special U.S. status, which has underpinned it as a finance hub, could be a ""double-edged sword"" and urged the United States to stop interfering in internal affairs.
The Chinese yuan  weakened slightly in onshore trade.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index (HSI) was 0.5% lower in early trade and has lost about 3% in the two weeks since news of China's security legislation broke. 
In bond markets, yields on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 3 basis points to 0.6705%, more than 100 basis points below where they began 2020.
MAY MARCHES ON
Despite the gathering tension and the near-daily release of diabolical economic data, enormous global stimulus seems to have dispelled the old adage to ""sell in May"".
The S&P 500 (SPX) is up 4% for the month and on track for its best May since 2009. The rally in the risk-sensitive Aussie dollar  is slowing, but the currency has gained nearly 2% for the month and sits 20% above March lows.
The optimism stems from signs of progress away from the presently parlous state of the world economy.
The number of Americans seeking jobless benefits fell for an eighth straight week last week and New York has outlined plans for reopening.
""As we have said about the reopening and ensuing recovery, this is a process,"" said RBC Capital Markets' chief U.S. economist, Tom Porcelli. ""And right now the process is moving along in the right direction.""
The euro (EUR=) was headed for its best month since December as the European Union's 750-billion-euro coronavirus recovery fund fuelled optimism about the bloc and its political future.
It hit a fresh two-month high of $1.1100 briefly and last sat at $1.0935.
Gold was firm at $1,720.87 an ounce.

Demand jitters kept oil under pressure and Brent crude slipped 33 cents or 0.9% to $34.96 a barrel, while U.S. crude was down 1.6% at $33.17 a barrel.

Investing.com - European stock markets are set to end the week on a negative note Friday, as investors nervously await the U.S. response to China tightening control over the city of Hong Kong, a major financial hub.
At 2:05 AM ET (0605 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower. {{167|France's CACAC 40 futures were down 0.7%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.7%.
China's parliament on Thursday pressed ahead with national security legislation for the city, raising fears over the future of its democratic freedoms.
U.S. President Donald Trump has already vowed a tough response should the law be agreed, and will hold a news conference later on Friday. 
American relations with Beijing have been on edge since the Covid-19 pandemic reared its head, and a possible response could see the tearing up of the Phase 1 trade deal and the imposition of fresh tariffs on China.
This would place European governments in a difficult position over how to respond as they shift from battling the coronavirus to economic recovery, where trade with China is likely to play a big part.
In corporate news,  Renault  (PA:RENA) will be in the spotlight Friday after the French carmaker said it was launching talks with unions to reorganise and cease assembling vehicles at several plants in France, cutting some 15,000 jobs worldwide as it tries to survive a slump in sales. Its partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) has also announced heavy cutbacks this week, including the closure of its plant in Barcelona.
Staying in the auto sector, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) could be of interest after the German car manufacturer announced it would be investing 2 billion euros in the Chinese electric vehicle sector.
Oil prices were under pressure Friday, after government data showed late Thursday an unexpected rise in U.S. inventories. The Energy Information Administration said inventories rose 7.9 million barrels in the week ended May 22, backing up Wednesday’s report by the American Petroleum Institute.
At 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.3% lower at $32.94 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 1.6% to $35.47.

American shares are as much as 16% overvalued at present levels, and a short position on the S&P 500 Index looks increasingly favorable, said strategist Daniel Grosvenor. Low bond yields aren’t sufficient to sustain equity valuations after the surge in shares from the March lows, he added.
“The threat of renewed tariffs adds clear downside risks to already-depressed global trade, and this could derail the eventual earnings recovery,” Grosvenor wrote in a report. “The market is vulnerable to a correction.”
Despite a slew of warnings about valuations and the pace of the rebound following the huge sell-off earlier this year, as well as the racheting-up of hostilities between the U.S. and China in the past couple of weeks, investors are pushing stock prices up through some key technical levels. The S&P 500 rose to nearly 3,069 intraday on Thursday, its highest level since March 5, and now sits above its 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages.
“The S&P 500 is expensive versus history on almost all the measures we consider,” Grosvenor said. His measure of valuing companies by discounting the value of their future cashflows would still be 6% overvalued even with an assumption of a much higher terminal growth rate of 4%, he wrote.

1031,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 29, 2020 12:54AM ET</span>",Europe Reaches a Tipping Point Over China’s Hong Kong Gamble,"(Bloomberg) -- Europe’s relations with China are going from bad to worse.
Beijing’s decision to force national security laws on Hong Kong has outraged many in the European Union for what they see as an attack on democracy. It places EU governments on the horns of a dilemma over how to respond as they shift from battling the coronavirus to economic recovery, where trade with China is likely to play a big part.
That is set to leave Europe somewhere in the middle as the U.S. weighs a range of penalties on China for encroaching further on Hong Kong’s freedoms. The EU’s chief foreign envoy, Josep Borrell, said this week that sanctions were not the solution “to our problems with China.” In a letter to the bloc’s foreign ministers ahead of a pre-scheduled video conference meeting on China on Friday, he urged them to consider “the tools of leverage we have.”
Yet European anger is palpable, and there are signs that China’s moves could have ramifications further down the line, by speeding European efforts to adopt a more unified industrial policy and influencing decisions on the role of Huawei Technologies Co. in 5G networks. A post-pandemic rescue plan presented by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron last week aims to fortify Europe internally, but also contains measures to equip it to better face outside threats.
Diplomacy is meanwhile at a low ebb, with China provoking European governments through aggressive social media posts over their handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, and some European officials criticizing Beijing in turn for its early response to the outbreak. While preparations officially continue for the first-ever summit of the EU’s 27 leaders and President Xi Jinping this fall, China watchers from academia to industry say they doubt the event billed as the highlight of a year of China-Europe engagement will even take place.
The upshot is a collection of friction points that may tip European leaders further toward a reassessment of China as more of a threat to Europe than viewing it as an ally against the Trump administration’s anti-globalization tendencies.
“Things are changing,” said Jean-Maurice Ripert, who was France’s ambassador to China until late 2019. The pandemic led to “an awakening toward China’s expansionist ambitions,” he said. “The Covid crisis and what’s going on in Hong Kong are opening the eyes of those who didn’t believe it.”
It’s an assessment shared by some leading politicians. Norbert Roettgen, chair of the Bundestag foreign affairs committee and an outside contender to succeed Merkel as chancellor, says that Europe’s credibility is on the line over its response to China.
Germany’s position in shaping Europe’s response will be key, both as the EU’s biggest economy and since it will assume the bloc’s rotating presidency on July 1. EU relations with China were supposed to be the centerpiece of Germany’s presidency, but the pandemic has shifted priorities.
The Chinese move against Hong Kong caught everyone off guard, according to a German government official with knowledge of the thinking in the Chancellery. That contributes to the dilemma Germany finds itself in. Merkel isn’t willing to join Donald Trump’s attacks, which include repeated references to Covid-19 as a “Chinese virus,” but she is aware the security situation in Hong Kong could deteriorate rapidly. Nobody wants a new Cold War, said the official, asking not to be named discussing internal strategy.
“China is not merely a partner and competitor, but a country with which we have profound differences with respect to the rule of law, freedom, democracy and human rights,” Merkel said in a speech Wednesday. While she referred to the “one country, two systems” principle for Hong Kong, the chancellor said that even such fundamental divisions shouldn’t prevent dialogue and cooperation.
Merkel’s high-wire balancing act has its critics. Nils Schmid, a senior lawmaker with her Social Democratic Party coalition partner, accused the chancellor this week of having an outdated idea of China as an economic partner above all, and of underestimating the “systemic challenges” posed by Beijing. Merkel has resisted a blanket ban on Huawei from 5G networks, a step favored by Roettgen among others.
‘Schizophrenic’
Europe should have leverage over China given Beijing’s need for allies in its deepening standoff with the U.S. In reality, the bloc is divided between those such as Italy and Hungary, enthusiastic backers of Xi’s trademark Belt and Road investment and infrastructure program, and others including France and Germany, which are more wary in their dealings with Beijing.
One EU diplomat who asked not to be named discussing Friday’s foreign ministers call described the bloc’s approach to China as “schizophrenic,” saying that it can’t decide if China is a strategic partner or an aggressive rival.
Still, in their joint plan, Merkel and Macron are pushing for stronger European industrial defenses and a reduced dependence on China. With its references to European champions -- Macron spoke of “technological sovereignty” -- a bloc-wide strategic health care industry and a focus on green and digital transitions, it represents much more than just the headline 500 billion-euro ($554 billion) rescue fund, said Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit.
For Janka Oertel, director of the Asia program at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, the Merkel-Macron proposal, which still needs the agreement of the bloc’s members, “was all about China without talking about China.”
Strategic Reassessment
“This is exactly where we are in the conversation, a European strategic reassessment of the relationship with China, and the challenges that China poses not globally but quite directly to the European economy,” she said.
In Paris, the official emphasis is on “rebalancing” European-Chinese relations toward greater reciprocal market access and the shared fight against climate change. Questions about Chinese interference in Hong Kong put to the French foreign ministry were directed to a tepid EU statement from this week in which the bloc said it attached “great importance” to the preservation of the territory’s autonomy, but fell short of criticizing China.
Even such declarations matter, and work will still be underway to forge a common European position, said Ripert, the French diplomat. “The situation is potentially explosive so it’s not unusual that Europe is taking its time,” he said. “Combative speeches are useless.”
Chinese officials have sought to downplay the potential impact of the national security legislation in Hong Kong, saying it will only affect a small number of people who helped foment violent protests last year. In an open letter to the city’s residents, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said “the overwhelming majority of citizens” would continue to enjoy the freedoms such as speech, the press and assembly under laws now being drafted by the National People’s Congress, China’s legislature.
5G Networks
“The EU will just say something for political reasons but it’s really more concerned about the recession,” said Wang Yiwei, a former Chinese diplomat at the Chinese embassy in Brussels. “They always talk about the rule of law but actually this is the rule of law. Since Hong Kong is part of China, of course its future will be decided by the NPC. The EU should support this decision but some lobbyists may be against it.”
Xi might have miscalculated by sanctioning an attack on Hong Kong’s democracy, said Reinhard Buetikofer, a German Green lawmaker who chairs the EU Parliament’s delegation for China relations.
If Beijing decides to pursue its course in Hong Kong, no one has the leverage to stop it, so the message must be “that it will come with a cost,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “And I would assume that some of the issues that have been contentious around Europe, like the issue of are we going to allow Huawei to participate in building of the 5G networks, may look differently under the auspices of recent Chinese actions.”
Legislation is still being drawn up in Berlin on 5G networks as part of an IT security law, with negotiations on Huawei’s involvement likely in the coming weeks before a draft goes to cabinet, possibly before the summer break. The debate over China more broadly has hardened, according to a German lawmaker familiar with the drafting.
The U.K. has opened a fresh review of Huawei’s role in its networks after the U.S. moved to shut down the Chinese company’s access to American technology. Those actions will influence German decision-making, said the ECFR’s Oertel.
On Sunday, as Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned the U.S. against starting a “new Cold War” with China, the ministry posted a series of tweets in English calling for solidarity with Europe. The pandemic requires both sides to “rise above ideological differences” and China and the EU should be “comprehensive strategic partners.”
For Friedolin Strack, managing director of the Asia-Pacific Committee of German Business, dialogue is essential and “decoupling” from China is not an option. But he too favors a stronger, more united Europe to better protect against issues like the distortion of competition by state-owned enterprises.
Strack’s committee helped shape an influential paper by the German BDI industry lobby last year that caused ripples across Europe and in Beijing by arguing for a more clear-eyed stance toward China. Two months later, the EU labeled China a systemic rival. He now sees an opportunity for Europe as “a strong middle partner,” sharing U.S. values while cooperating with China on multilateral solutions. “There is a huge potential in positioning the EU as a stronger global player,” he said."

1033,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 10:51PM ET</span>",Trump move could scrap or weaken law that protects social media companies,"By Nandita Bose and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said he will introduce legislation that may scrap or weaken a law that has protected internet companies, including Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), in an extraordinary attempt to regulate social media platforms where he has been criticized. 
The proposed legislation is part of an executive order Trump signed on Thursday afternoon. Trump had attacked Twitter for tagging his tweets about unsubstantiated claims of fraud about mail-in voting with a warning prompting readers to fact-check the posts.
Trump wants to ""remove or change"" a provision of a law known as Section 230 that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users.
Trump said U.S. Attorney General William Barr will begin drafting legislation ""immediately"" to regulate social media companies.
On Wednesday, Reuters reported the White House's plan to modify Section 230 based on a copy of a draft executive order that experts said was unlikely to survive legal scrutiny. The final version of the order released on Thursday had no major changes except the proposal for a federal legislation.
""What I think we can say is we're going to regulate it,"" Trump said before the signing of the order.
""I've been called by Democrats that want to do this, so I think you could possibly have a bipartisan situation,"" said Republican Trump, who is running for re-election in November.
Twitter called the order ""a reactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law"" and said attempts to weaken Section 230 would ""threaten the future of online speech.""
A Google spokeswoman said the order would harm ""America's economy,"" while a Facebook spokesman said it would ""encourage platforms to censor anything that might offend anyone.""
The order, as written, attempts to circumvent Congress and the courts in directing changes to long-established interpretations of Section 230. It represents his latest attempt to use the tools of the presidency to force private companies to change policies that he believes are not favorable to him.
""In terms of presidential efforts to limit critical commentary about themselves, I think one would have to go back to the Sedition Act of 1798 - which made it illegal to say false things about the president and certain other public officials - to find an attack supposedly rooted in law by a president on any entity which comments or prints comments about public issues and public people,"" said First Amendment lawyer Floyd Abrams.
Jack Balkin, a Yale University constitutional law professor, said ""the president is trying to frighten, coerce, scare, cajole social media companies to leave him alone and not do what Twitter has just done to him."" 
Twitter's shares ended over 4 percent down on Thursday. Facebook ended down 1.6 percent and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc finished slightly up.
Trump, who uses Twitter virtually every day to promote his policies and insult his opponents, has long claimed without evidence that the site is biased in favor of Democrats. He and his supporters have leveled the same unsubstantiated charges against Facebook, which Trump's presidential campaign uses heavily as an advertising vehicle.
On Thursday, Trump said there is nothing he would rather do than get rid of his Twitter account but he had to keep it in order to circumvent the press and get his version of events to millions of followers.
He took to Twitter again Thursday night to cast doubt around voting by mail, tweeting the practice would lead to ""MASSIVE FRAUD AND ABUSE"" and ""THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY.""
The protections of Section 230 have been under fire for different reasons from lawmakers including Big Tech critic Senator Josh Hawley. Critics argue that they give internet companies a free pass on things like hate speech and content that supports terror organizations. 
Social media companies have been under pressure from many quarters, both in the United States and other countries, to better control misinformation and harmful content on their services.
Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey said on the company's website late Wednesday that the president's tweets ""may mislead people into thinking they don't need to register to get a ballot. Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves."" 
After labeling Trump's tweets, Twitter continued to add fact-checking and 'manipulated media' labels on hundreds of other tweets.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Trump's planned order ""outrageous"" and a ""distraction"" from the coronavirus crisis.
Under the order, the Commerce Department has 60 days to petition the FCC to adopt new rules and then the agency will review the petition. It could take anywhere from 12 to 24 months for the FCC to propose and adopt final rules. 

Federal spending on online advertising will also be reviewed by U.S. government agencies to ensure there are no speech restrictions by a company.

China has vowed to retaliate against any U.S. response to the laws.
“Tensions between the US and Chinese governments over a security law for Hong Kong continue to escalate,” Joseph Capurso, head of international economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), said in a note.
“We consider the tensions between these two governments over Hong Kong, trade, the coronavirus and the South China sea will not fade.”
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.51% by 10:24 PM ET (3:24 AM GMT).

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday said institutional investors, including BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Allianz SE's (DE:ALVG) Pacific Investment Management Co, can pursue much of their lawsuit accusing 15 major banks of rigging prices in the $6.6 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market.
U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan said the nearly 1,300 plaintiffs, including many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, plausibly alleged that the banks conspired to rig currency benchmarks from 2003 to 2013 and profit at their expense.
""This is an injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent,"" Schofield wrote in a 40-page decision.
The banks, which sometimes controlled more than 90% of the market, included Bank of America,  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS), Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) and UBS or various affiliates.
In their complaint, the plaintiffs accused the banks of improperly sharing confidential orders and trading positions, and using chat rooms with such names as ""The Cartel,"" ""The Mafia"" and ""The Bandits' Club.""
Banks were also accused of using deceptive trading tactics such as ""front running,"" ""banging the close"" and ""taking out the filth.""
The banks countered that the plaintiffs pointed to no transactions where the alleged manipulation caused losses.
Schofield dismissed portions of some the claims, and dismissed some Allianz plaintiffs from the case.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The litigation began in November 2018, after the plaintiffs ""opted out"" of similar nationwide litigation that had resulted in $2.31 billion of settlements with most of the banks.
Those settlements followed regulatory probes worldwide that led to more than $10 billion of fines for several banks, and the convictions or indictments of some traders.
Investors typically opt out of litigation when they hope to recover more by suing on their own.

The decision by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) also approved the company's request to issue new debt and securities to finance its exit from bankruptcy, PG&E said in a statement.
The San Francisco-based utility had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January last year, citing potential liabilities exceeding $30 billion from major wildfires sparked by its equipment in 2017 and 2018. The company needs to exit bankruptcy by June 30 to participate in a state-backed wildfire fund that would help reduce the threat to utilities from wildfires.
The power provider has had a tumultuous phase since the filing, with CPUC having asked the company in April for governance and oversight changes to its reorganization plan. Governor Gavin Newsom too had previously raised concerns about the plan.
PG&E said the California power regulator has now approved a number of measures to improve its governance process, operational structure, and safety performance.
The regulatory approval came hours after a federal judge blasted the company for engaging in behavior that he believed is endangering lives.
Earlier in the day, U.S. District Judge William Alsup said power regulators in California have not done enough to hold the company accountable.
The November 2018 wildfire destroyed much of the town of Paradise, which had about 26,000 people, and nearby Concow. More than 18,000 buildings were affected.

PG&E also agreed to put itself up for sale if it cannot emerge from Chapter 11 by a state-imposed June 30 deadline, before the next wildfire season begins.

1039,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>",Sainsbury's new boss Roberts faces unexpected in-tray,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - When  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY) new boss Simon Roberts hosts a virtual focus group with supermarket shoppers on his first day in charge on Monday, the conversation will be radically different from the one he might have imagined when he got the job.
In late January, Britain's second largest supermarket group by sales after  Tesco  (L:TSCO) announced retail and operations director Roberts would succeed Mike Coupe as chief executive after his six years in the job.
Then the biggest issues Roberts faced were honing a strategy for Sainsbury's to prosper alone after its failure to combine with Asda, owned by Walmart (N:WMT), getting through Brexit and fending off competition from Amazon (O:AMZN) and German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Four months on, those problems have been dwarfed by the coronavirus crisis, which has fundamentally changed Britain's retail outlook and raised the prospect of a severe global recession.
For Sainsbury's, whose shares are down 16% so far in 2020, the pandemic has boosted grocery sales but hammered demand for fuel, general merchandise and clothing, pushed its bank into a likely annual loss and raised operating costs across the group.
Roberts, 49, takes office with the exact nature and duration of the financial impact of COVID-19, the disease caused by novel coronavirus, impossible to predict. 
As he seeks to impose his authority, he has the challenge of dealing with a team working virtually and, however pressing the need for short-term crisis management, he must not neglect the strategic, long-term decisions.
""As you look forward, there is a whole series of choices and some of those choices are short-term but a lot of those choices long-term that need to be made by the new leadership,"" Coupe said.
For the longer term, Robert has to make the calls that can deliver growth, taking into account the disruption to consumer behaviour caused by the virus and lockdown.
Those changes include a more pronounced shift to online, less frequent customer visits to supermarkets, but a bigger average spend per shopping trip, and the increased popularity of local convenience stores.
Roberts has to figure out which changes will survive into post-lockdown times and how much money to plough into online delivery and technology.
He also has to assess the optimum configuration of Sainsbury's store estate - currently over 600 supermarkets, 800 convenience stores and 573 standalone Argos stores.
And he has to decide whether to keep, or get rid of, the bank that is unpopular with investors.

Roberts won't be the new kid on the supermarket CEO block for long. In October, industry leader Tesco also gets a new boss when Ken Murphy, a former colleague of Roberts at Boots, takes over from Dave Lewis.

Lloyds said its monthly business barometer dropped to -33, matching the historic low set in December 2008, reflecting reduced optimism about the economy and weaker hiring intentions.
""Despite the results partly capturing the period since the government's announcement of an initial easing of restrictions, trading conditions remain difficult for most firms,"" Lloyds economist Hann-Ju Ho said.
Last week a purchasing managers' index for Britain's services and manufacturing sectors showed a slower pace of decline in May than in April, although Britain's economy is still on course for a contraction of historic proportions.
A separate report from manufacturing trade body Make UK on Friday showed that a quarter of its members planned to make staff redundant over the next six months, as growing numbers expected it to take more than a year for the economy to recover. 
Britain's economy went into full lockdown on March 23, but this month the government has been encouraging businesses to return to work, and next month a wider range of retailers will be able to reopen to the public.

Britain's car industry said just 197 vehicles were made across the country in April - the fewest since World War Two - and some big manufacturers such as Nissan (OTC:NSANY) do not plan to restart production until next month.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower on Thursday following a late-session reversal, with Facebook weighing on the market after President Donald Trump said he would sign an executive order related to social media companies and would hold a news conference on China on Friday.
Shares of  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) ended down 4.4% and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) fell 1.6% following news of the executive order. The White House, after the market close, said Trump had signed the order, which removes a liability shield they currently enjoy.
Trump said he was directing Attorney General William Barr to work with states to enforce their own laws against what he described as deceptive business practices by social media companies.
Concerns about China-U.S. relations may also have driven the late decline. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told CNBC on Thursday that Hong Kong may now be needed to be treated like China when it comes to trade and other matters, echoing remarks by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday.
""We are concerned (it's) saber rattling with China... It was just a big selloff because of that,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, New York.
Stocks had been higher for most of the session as investors continued to bet on a swift recovery from the coronavirus-driven economic slump.
Worsening ties in recent weeks between the United States and China, the world's two largest economies, could pose a threat to the stock market's strong recovery from its steep selloff.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The city of Sao Paulo is investigating the wholesale unit of  Carrefour  Brasil SA (SA:CRFB3) in connection with an alleged bribery scheme, the local official gazette said on Thursday, citing a probe that could result in a fine of up to 20% of the company's 2019 gross revenue.
The investigation is related to a criminal case that uncovered payments to city inspectors totaling around 1.5 million reais ($280,000) to operate, without a license, the headquarters of wholesale division Atacadao and an adjoining store in Sao Paulo.
In a statement, Carrefour Brasil said it has not yet received any notification regarding the administrative probe or information about its content, but that it is committed to cooperating with authorities.
In March, public prosecutors filed corruption charges against four Atacadao representatives. They are no longer working for the company, according to Carrefour Brasil.
""Carrefour Brasil Group rejects any and all acts of corruption and reiterates that it has a Code of Ethics aligned to the Brazilian law,"" the retailer said.
The new administrative probe can take up to 180 days, with a possible extension of another 180 days, according to Sao Paulo's office of the controller.
If Atacadao is held responsible, the company will be forced to pay a fine between 0.1% and 20% of its gross revenue in the year preceding the probe.
""The amount depends on the infraction that occurred, always ensuring that the percentage applied is not lower than the advantage obtained,"" the city's controller said.
The local subsidiary of France's Carrefour SA (PA:CARR) reported gross revenue of 62.22 billion reais in 2019, of which 42.05 billion reais came from Atacadao. 

""Since at least 2007, when Carrefour bought Atacadao, the administrative headquarters in Vila Maria and the adjoining store did not have a license to operate,"" public prosecutor Roberto Bodini told Reuters in an interview, adding the license was only obtained in 2015.

LONDON (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) took a mark-to-market trading loss of C$88.2 million ($64 million) in one day in March due mainly to volatility in the gold market, the bank said in its second-quarter earnings report on Thursday. 
CIBC is not alone in being caught out when the coronavirus outbreak interrupted gold supply routes and gold futures prices in New York shot above London spot prices.
HSBC said earlier this month it suffered paper losses of about $200 million on one day in March.
The losses by both banks are theoretical, reflecting the value of positions they held. They would become real only if the bank exited the positions when their value was low.
CIBC said the loss happened on March 24 and was ""mostly attributable to our precious metals trading business"". 
It was by far the biggest trading loss of any day since May last year, its report showed. CIBC said it was mostly recouped in April.
Gold trading banks plan to reduce their gold futures positions significantly on CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) Comex exchange in New York because they fear further price volatility, Reuters reported on Thursday.

A reduction of activity by banks on Comex, the world's largest gold futures market, would increase the relative importance of London as a trading centre and raise costs for thousands of gold investors who use the exchange.

(Reuters) - Upscale department store chain  Nordstrom Inc  (N:JWN) on Thursday reported a nearly 40% slump in quarterly sales, as lockdowns to contain the COVID-19 pandemic shut stores. 
Measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak have weighed heavily on retailers, with J.C. Penney (N:JCP), J.Crew, Neiman Marcus and Stage Stores all having recently filed for bankruptcy. 
Seattle-based Nordstrom said online sales rose 5% to $1.1 billion in its first quarter ended May 2. The retailer has strived to reduce inventory, cut costs and sharpen its marketing strategy. 
""We successfully strengthened our financial flexibility by increasing liquidity, lowering inventory by more than 25 percent from last year and significantly reducing our cash burn by more than 40 percent from March into April,"" Chief Executive Erik Nordstrom said in a statement. ""We're entering the second quarter in a position of strength."" 
Nordstrom said roughly 40% of its stores have reopened, though they are in smaller markets. It plans to reopen its entire fleet of shops by the end of June, including in major markets California and New York.
Total net sales in the first quarter dropped to $2.03 billion from $3.35 billion a year earlier.
It reported a net loss of $521 million, or $3.33 per share, compared with a profit of $37 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. 
The company said store closures and restructuring led to a $173 million charge. Earlier this month, Nordstrom announced it would close 16 of its 116 full-line U.S. stores. 

Earlier on Thursday, America's top dollar store chains,  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG) and  Dollar Tree Inc  (O:DLTR), beat profit estimates and said they would benefit from demand for affordable groceries and household essentials in coming months as rising unemployment threatens to spur a deep recession.

1046,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Capital Flight Fears Grow Alongside Hong Kong Political Turmoil,"(Bloomberg) --
The fresh political turmoil engulfing Hong Kong in recent days is reviving worries over capital outflows from one of the world’s biggest financial hubs.
While there’s little evidence so far that investors, large companies or expat residents are rushing to move their money, the emergence of China’s national security bill and the U.S. response that it can no longer certify Hong Kong’s political autonomy is stoking concern.
The developments come after Hong Kong in the past year was pushed into a deep economic crisis triggered by political upheaval and, since late January, the coronavirus outbreak. The growing worry is that Beijing’s latest intervention will finally undermine confidence in the city’s prized legal system.
The announcement Wednesday by Secretary of State Michael Pompeo on Hong Kong raises the potential for far-reaching consequences for the city’s special trading status with the U.S.
“Hong Kong’s international financial center has been built on a huge talent and expat pool,” said Kevin Lai, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Daiwa Capital Markets. “Many people may leave. They will also take their money with them.”
For international investors and executives, much will depend on details of China’s new security law and how it affects Hong Kong’s judiciary and exactly how the U.S. chooses to respond. Another big concern is whether political unrest will flare up again after months of relative calm -- police and protesters have clashed in recent days in central shopping districts over the China-backed laws.
“Investors are clearly concerned about this,” Timothy Moe, chief Asia-Pacific equity strategist at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) told reporters in an online briefing Tuesday. “Political issues will remain at the forefront of market awareness.”
President Donald Trump is considering a range of sanctions to punish China for its crackdown on Hong Kong. Options range from visa restrictions and asset freezes for top officials to imposing tariffs on goods coming from Hong Kong.
One gauge of stress in Hong Kong’s financial system is the flow of capital and whether companies and savers pull their money out.
It’s a fear that dominated sentiment through 2019 as political upheaval roiled the city, though ultimately capital flows remained broadly stable. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority argued this week that there haven’t been noticeable fund outflows from either the Hong Kong dollar or banking system.
Capital Controls
Unlike mainland China -- where the capital account is tightly controlled -- Hong Kong allows money to flow unrestricted. Sustained periods of outflows have occurred during previous bouts of stress such as the global financial crisis and SARS epidemic, and when the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates.
Teresa Kong, a portfolio manager at Matthews Asia in San Francisco, said a lot will depend on how the security law is enforced -- a heavy-handed approach could prompt money to flow out of the city.
For now, Hong Kong’s role as a source of capital, strong rule of law, ease of doing business and educated labor force are factors too powerful for China to discard, Kong said.
“Hence, my base case is not material capital flight out of Hong Kong,” she said.
There’s also a powerful counterforce in the form of unprecedented volumes of money flowing in from mainland China, a trend set to continue if Chinese firms increasingly opt to list in Hong Kong instead of the U.S.
Market Measures
There’s no one measure that shows how capital is moving in and out of Hong Kong and certainly, and trends in the currency, stocks and property markets can be skewed by other factors. Instead, analysts rely on a variety of metrics to determine capital flows.
The change in the aggregate balance of interbank liquidity -- bank funds held with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority -- is among the most visible indicators of fund-flow pressures. Recent intervention by the HKMA to defend the local dollar’s peg to the greenback has helped.
A rapid withdrawal of deposits or reversal of portfolio flows would drain confidence in Hong Kong’s economy, though there’s little sign in the data of a sharp decline.
By one estimate, Hong Kong had most recently registered cumulative net inflows of foreign currency assets from last October through January, before seeing modest outflows in February and March, according to data from Lai at Daiwa.
Any weakness in the Hong Kong dollar can also reflect capital outflows, but the currency’s usefulness as an indicator is limited because it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1983. The city’s de facto central bank says it remains committed to keeping the currency in a tight trading range against the greenback.

When the national security proposal was announced in Beijing on May 22, the MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Hong Kong Index, the city’s benchmark of local stocks, plunged 6.9%. That was its biggest slide since October 2008. The Hang Seng Index, which includes Hong Kong-listed mainland stocks, sank the most in almost five years.
City officials including Financial Secretary Paul Chan are trying to allay worries that the moves will threaten confidence in the financial sector. Yet local business groups including the American Chamber of Commerce have voiced concern about the “vaguely defined” law.
Others warn that the line between political tensions and freedom to do business is becoming increasingly blurred.
The recent sequence of events could be the trigger for companies to move out of Hong Kong, taking capital and labor with them, according to Tianlei Huang, research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
“Confidence is a fragile thing,” he said.

Some 4,500 jobs would go in France, though largely through a voluntary departure plan and a retirement scheme, the CFDT’s Franck Daout told Reuters on Thursday. 
The overall cuts would affect just under 10% of Renault's 180,000 global workforce. The firm has around 48,500 staff in France. 
""They've insisted on the fact everything will be negotiated,"" Daout said, adding that unions and state bodies would be involved in talks over potential job losses in France. 
Renault declined to comment. The carmaker's board signed off on the plans to launch its cost savings programme on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter said. 
The French group, which is 15% owned by the government, had earlier this year flagged a looming ""no taboo"" plan to cut 2 billion in costs after posting its first loss in a decade last year. 
That raised concern for some of its factories, including in France, although closures could be politically sensitive. 
The French government has already said it will not sign off on a planned 5 billion euro state loan for Renault - an aid measure linked to the coronavirus pandemic - until management and unions conclude talks over the carmaker's French workforce and plants in France.
The coronavirus crisis has compounded the company's problems, accentuating a slump in demand that was already hurting sales. 
Renault's plans to invest in and extend operations in Morocco and Romania are likely to be frozen, Les Echos newspaper reported on Thursday, while its worldwide production capacity could be cut by 4 million vehicles to 3.3 million. 

The restructuring follows a retrenchment by Japanese partner Nissan (T:7201), which is closing some plants and planning to become smaller and more efficient.

(Reuters) - The top three U.S. airlines, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, are rolling out fresh programs to induce tens of thousands of employees to accept voluntary leave or early retirement in the hope of avoiding widespread furloughs in the fall, company memos show.
Around 100,000 employees of  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) have already accepted offers for temporary or permanent leaves, the companies have said.
Airlines continue to reduce their workforces in an effort to align their businesses with the sharp downfall in air travel. But they are also trying to keep enough workers, particularly pilots whose training is costly and lengthy, to service any recovery. 
If airlines furlough too many workers, ""the bounce-back is almost impossible,"" United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said at a conference on Thursday.
United is in talks with its labor unions on voluntary options that Kirby said are focused more on the bounce-back than on ""survivability.""
Airlines have said cancellations are slowing and bookings are improving, though their flying schedules are still just about 20% of what they would normally be. 
Delta, with around 91,000 employees, announced on Thursday details of an enhanced retirement package for long-term employees and a separate voluntary opt-out package. Both include cash severance, full healthcare coverage and travel benefits, a memo dated May 27 showed.
In a video seen by Reuters, the company said it is offering between four and 20 weeks of severance along with 12 months of health care and travel benefits for the voluntary opt-out. Delta is offering up to 26 weeks of severance for enhanced retirement packages and retiree medical accounts of more than $100,000.
""Every voluntary departure helps to protect the jobs of those who most need them,"" CEO Ed Bastian said in the memo to employees. He added: ""I can't emphasize enough how challenging the environment is, and will be for the foreseeable future.""
Delta says most retirements will take place Aug. 1.
U.S. airlines cannot force any job or pay rate cuts until Oct. 1 under the terms of the federal CARES Act, which provides billions of dollars to help cover their payroll expenses until Sept. 30.
After that date, airlines have warned of involuntary reductions if overall workforces are still larger than needed.
American Airlines, with more than 100,000 employees, told its management and support staff on Wednesday that it must cut about 30% of their ranks, the same size of reductions planned by United for its management and administrative employees.
""We must plan for operating a smaller airline for the foreseeable future,"" American's Elise Eberwein told employees Wednesday in an email.

American is also discussing voluntary options with unions representing pilots and flight attendants, and Delta with its pilots' union. Delta's flight attendants are not unionized.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines (NYSE:LTM) Group's (SN:LTM) U.S. bankruptcy filing this week will delay its potential bailout in Brazil to at least July and also push back aid to its rivals at least through the end of June, two sources said on Thursday. 
The delays will add further strain to Brazil's airlines, which were already in weak shape before the pandemic. Rivals  Azul SA  (N:AZUL) and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (SA:GOLL4) are also negotiating bailouts. 
""The bailout will happen; what could happen is that it may be staggered due to LATAM's situation,"" said one source. 
Neither LATAM nor Brazil's state development bank, BNDES, which is coordinating the bailout, had an immediate comment. 
LATAM's bankruptcy filing this week has caused private banks to worry about the viability of Brazil's airlines after the pandemic, the sources said. 
LATAM's Brazil subsidiary is not part of the U.S. bankruptcy, although executives acknowledge it is possible it might also go through a court restructuring. 
Government and private banks are also worried layoffs will be unavoidable, which could have negative political implications, the sources said. 
LATAM does not dispute it will lay off workers. LATAM's Brazil CEO, Jerome Cadier, told Reuters this week the company will undergo downsizing and that layoffs are not prohibited under the government's current draft of bailout conditions. 
He added that if layoffs were banned, the rescue program would have to be much bigger. Currently, the bailout is valued at 6 billion reais. 
LATAM's bankruptcy has also raised questions about the collateral on any bailout loans. 
One source said the Brazilian government is still figuring out how best to lend to LATAM considering its parent company is in bankruptcy protection. Usually the development bank asks for collateral from parent companies. 

""What we would want is for that collateral to have priority over the rest of the company's debts,"" the source said.

Just a day earlier, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Hong Kong no longer had a high degree of autonomy from China, throwing Hong Kong's status as a trade hub into doubt and raising concerns that Washington and Beijing are headed on a collision course just months after both sides agreed a truce on trade.
Fresh concerns over rising U.S-China tensions soured sentiment on stocks, forcing the broader market to cut its gains, paced by declines in energy and financials.
Financials gave up some of their gains from earlier this week as investors took profits on bank stocks, with JPMorgan (NYSE:NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) ending the day lower.
On the economic front, further signs of the Covid-19 impact on the economy did little rein in bullish bets on an economic rebound in the second half of the year amid optimism over the progress on reopening the economy so far.

In another stark reminder of the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on the economy, revised government data showed first-quarter GDP contracted at an annual pace of 5%, rather than the initial estimate of 4.8%.
As efforts to reopen the economy continue, healthcare stocks caught a bid, with  Moderna  and Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) leading the pack of drugmakers in the race to find a Covid-19 cure.
Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) jumped 6.4% after reaching a deal with CordenPharma for the supply of volumes of the lipids used to produce its coronavirus vaccine candidate mRNA-1273.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian court has ordered JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) to keep 1.5 meters (4.92 ft) of distance between workers at its chicken processing plant in the town of Ipumirim, according to a statement from the state labor prosecutor's office on Thursday.
The labor prosecutor's office in the southern state of Santa Catarina said the court also stipulated in an injunction that JBS should send workers suspected of having the new coronavirus on paid leave, even if they are asymptomatic, for a minimum of 14 days.
Operations at that JBS plant, which was ordered shut on May 18 by labor auditors, can only resume if the company complies with the measures, the statement said, citing the terms of the ruling.
""We took action to ensure that when the work returns at the plant, the company is obliged to meet these requirements,"" one of the prosecutors involved in the case told Reuters. 
JBS said that its workers' health is its top priority and that it had adopted strict protocols to protect them from the virus, in line with government directives. It declined to comment on the ongoing legal case regarding its plant.
Labor auditors have powers to close the plant and apply fines, and prosecutors have a mandate to ask the court to order the company to comply with certain obligations or potentially face further penalties.
According to the labor auditors responsible for the inspection that resulted in the closing of the plant, 86 coronavirus cases had been confirmed at the JBS plant, representing almost 5% of the estimated 1,500 workers there.

The plant processes some 135,000 chickens per day, with most of the output destined to export markets, according company disclosures and labor auditors.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian court ruling that could permit the extradition of a senior Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] executive to the United States leaves Canada vulnerable to further retaliation from Beijing, analysts said.
Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Wednesday lost a challenge to a U.S. bid to extradite her to face bank fraud charges, a decision the Chinese embassy in Ottawa strongly denounced.
For Canada, the stakes are high. After Meng's arrest in Vancouver in December 2018, China detained two Canadian citizens on state security charges and blocked imports of some canola seed.
This month, China's CanSino Biologics Inc began working with the country's National Research Council to ""pave the way"" for future COVID-19 vaccine trials in Canada. China has been supplying the country with personal protection equipment during the outbreak.
""If China decides to cut us off from those kinds of things, people will die,"" said Stephanie Carvin, an assistant professor and security expert at Ottawa's Carleton University.
""My very strong concern is that cooperation goes away very quickly, and it leaves us in a very bad position,"" she added. 
Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, forecast Beijing would announce a trial date for the two Canadian citizens it is holding, as well as taking more punitive trade measures.
Chinese President ""Xi Jinping will want to appear strong and will want to be seen as acting against Canada,"" Saint-Jacques told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
Asked on Thursday if he feared Chinese backlash, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not answer. Instead, he noted that Canada's judiciary system is independent, and renewed his call for immediate release of citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor.
""We will continue to defend our interests and our values,"" Trudeau added.
""There are a lot of issues in play,"" said Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Trudeau and professor of international affairs at University of Ottawa.
Managing relations with China is like ""walking the razor's edge,"" he said. 
""Our approach to China is one that is not naive and... we're not afraid to take a strong line and a firm line when we need to,"" said a government source in Ottawa, requesting anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
University of British Columbia professor Paul Evans predicted the two detainees would remain behind bars for some time. 

The ruling ""isn't going to make life easier for the two Michaels,"" he said.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  (N:GE) expects to burn more cash than expected in the second quarter, as the industrial conglomerate struggles with weakness in its aviation business due to the coronavirus crisis, Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp (NYSE:CULP) said on Thursday.
Shares of GE, which makes aircraft engines and power plants, fell as much as 3.6% to $7.03 after Culp also warned that the company's 2020 free cash flow will be negative.
GE's second-quarter free cash outflow is expected to be between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, he said at a conference. That was bigger than analysts' average estimate of an outflow of $2.5 billion, according to Refnitiv IBES data. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought air travel to a virtual standstill, hitting GE's aviation business at a time when its power business was struggling with sluggish demand.
The company has cut thousands of jobs in a bid to save cash and last month pulled its full-year forecast, citing the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. 
""Losing that much money adds meaningfully to GE's elevated net leverage burden,"" Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch said, adding that the magnitude of cash outflow at GE places it out of step with most of its industrial peers.
Culp said GE's commercial jet engine installs would fall about 45% in the second quarter, with sales of aircraft spares declining about 60%.

The coronavirus crisis, however, has boosted sales of the company's healthcare products, with second-quarter orders expected to rise more than 100%, Culp said.

1063,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 28, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>","Hopeful Homeowners Should Watch Mortgage Market, Not Treasuries","(Bloomberg) -- For Americans hoping to buy a home or refinance the one they’re in at ever-lower rates, the mortgage TBA (to-be-announced) market is where one must look. That’s where lenders can sell the mortgages they create.
Granted, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is closely correlated to the 30-year mortgage rate, and is often seen as a good guide to home loan rates. So while the 10-year yield has declined 1.21% this year, the 30-year mortgage rate has dropped less than half of that. But it is the yield of the so-called production TBA coupon -- and the spread at which lenders will grant a mortgage over that yield -- which matters most to borrowers.
That difference, known as the primary/secondary spread, has been trending far above its historic average in this new era of quantitative easing, and has kept mortgage lending rates higher than they otherwise would be. As of Wednesday’s close, the spread is 1.90%, almost double the 0.99% average seen over the last half decade.
This is where the legislative generosity that Congress showed in granting an easy forbearance to all homeowners with government-backed mortgages can hurt the very people it was meant to help. A loan that stops paying -- whether defined as delinquent or in forbearance -- can wipe out any profit for those who make a living offering or servicing mortgages. In addition, those loans have a much higher risk of being bought out of mortgage bond pools, potentially hurting investor returns.
Whether one looks at the record-low  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) 30-year rate (3.15%) or the Bankrate.com 30-year rate (3.57%,) it’s arguable that the added risk from forbearance has kept mortgage lenders from offering even lower rates.
The primary/secondary spread is in part a measure of how much risk lenders believe there is within mortgages -- and forbearance has certainly elevated it. As of May 17, servicers have seen 8.36% of their loans drop into forbearance, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
Less Help Than Before
In addition, the Federal Reserve’s ramping down of its MBS purchases suggest that ever-lower mortgage rates will be highly dependent on a tighter primary/secondary spread going forward. The central bank’s massive buying of TBA ($678 billion in just 11 weeks) has helped push lending rates lower. Yet its daily purchases have fallen to about $5 billion this month, a shadow of the recent high of just over $41 billion bought on March 27.
The main production coupon -- the 30-year 2.5% TBA -- has benefited from over $163 billion in Fed purchases since QE restarted on March 16. Yet the coupon has responded to less Fed help with a price drop from 103-31 at the end of April to 103-16 as of Wednesday’s close. (Keep in mind that lower prices mean higher yields.)
The Federal Reserve on May 11 began to purchase the UMBS 2% 30-year TBA -- they have now bought $3.6 billion -- which has helped keep that coupon’s price elevated. The coupon closed at 101-23+ Wednesday night, down 1/16 from its close the day before the central bank began to target it.
As much as the Federal Reserve buying helps push lending rates lower than they otherwise would be (because higher TBA prices lead to lower mortgage rates), the added risk of forbearance can negate this benefit, if even in part.
Still, should lenders tighten the primary/secondary spread back to its trailing five-year average, Americans could enjoy mortgage rates almost 1% less than the already historic lows currently seen.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) has raised close to $4 billion from investors to snap up corporate debt at significant discounts, as the coronavirus outbreak weighs on big swathes of the corporate world, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
A wave of interventions from the Federal Reserve and trillions of dollars in U.S. government stimulus have allowed many companies battered by the crisis to continue to borrow. Yet several firms, particularly those whose debt is rated 'junk' by credit rating agencies, are struggling to stay afloat. 
They have seen the value of their debt plunge, leaving them with limited or no access to capital markets. Their battered bonds represent attractive opportunities for KKR, the sources said. 
KKR raised $2.8 billion for its KKR Dislocation Opportunities Fund and more than $1.1 billion through separately managed accounts investing alongside the fund, the sources said. The fund is a rebranding of KKR's Special Situations Fund III, which the private equity firm was marketing to investors last year with a $1.5 billion target, Reuters reported at the time.
""We know this market is not a forgiving one, but as we navigate this global crisis together, we will find attractive opportunities to invest in good companies with strong fundamentals and sustainable cash flows at discounted prices,"" Chris Sheldon, KKR's head of leveraged credit, wrote in a letter to investors in April.
After it rebranded the credit investment fund for the COVID-19 era, KKR completed its fundraising in eight weeks, securing capital commitments from over 20 new institutional investors, the sources said. 
KKR and its employees invested about $447 million in the new fund, which will have an 18-month investment period, the sources added.
KKR had about $67.6 billion in assets under management in its credit business as of the end of March.

Corbat said on Thursday the return will be ""granular, site-by-site and within those sites, job-by-job"", adding that sometime in July or possibly August is when the bank hopes to return about 5% of some 12,000 employees at Citigroup's main building in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood. 
Staff returning to work will begin next month at the Canary Wharf complex in London, he added. 
""The return of our colleagues to our sites will vary depending on local conditions and be driven by data, not dates,"" Citi spokeswoman Jennifer Lowney said in a statement. 
""We anticipate a slow and measured reentry once local conditions permit, beginning with only a small number of colleagues who have a clear and compelling need to operate from a given location,"" the spokeswoman added.

LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) has not been given an advisory role on the potential sale of a stake in  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222)'s pipeline business, a deal worth over $10 billion, two sources told Reuters.
The U.S. investment bank, which has previously advised the world's largest oil company, was originally looking to be part of the advisory group on any deal, the sources added.
However, Aramco has mandated JP Morgan (N:JPM) and Japan's MUFG (T:8306) to advise it on the deal, which is still in its early stages but would provide the company with cash at a time of low oil prices caused by the coronavirus crisis, the sources said.
Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and MUFG all declined to comment, while Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment on plans for the pipeline business.
Although Morgan Stanley was one of Aramco's top advisers on its initial public offering last year, three local banks - NCB, Samba and HSBC Saudi Arabia - ended up controlling most of the process when the listing was scaled down. 
U.S. investment banks have recently been shrinking lending outside their home market during the coronavirus crisis, sources told Reuters last month. 
Aramco's pipeline sale would be similar to the path taken by Abu Dhabi's national oil company ADNOC last year, when it raised $4 billion by selling a 40% stake in its pipelines division to U.S. investment firms KKR and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the sources said.
While ADNOC is in the process of replicating its deal by selling its natural gas pipeline assets, sources have told Reuters, in Aramco's case the process is proving more difficult and moving more slowly, the sources added.

Saudi Arabia is seen by international investors as riskier, one of the sources said, citing an attack on Saudi oil plants last year, the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and the war in Yemen.

1079,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",The new workplace? Central and eastern Europe may be closer than most,"By Alan Charlish
WARSAW (Reuters) - When Mario Pereira's Polish colleague, sitting not far from him in a Warsaw office, sent him an email rather than walking over to speak, the Portuguese was shocked. 
Coming from a culture where he says there is much more face-to-face contact between workers, Pereira found it ""awkward"". In Portugal ""it is somehow important to see the person,"" he said.
Yet the workplace of the future is likely to be more Polish than Portuguese.
Research suggests the fact that central and eastern Europeans have fewer face-to-face contacts at work may have contributed to lower rates of coronavirus infection than elsewhere on the continent. 
""For the professional and managerial jobs we find that in the central and eastern European countries the frequency of working with clients at clients' premises, meeting with clients... is lower,"" said Piotr Lewandowski, president of the Institute for Structural Research in Warsaw.
His research, drawing on data from the U.S.-based Occupational Information Network (O*Net) and the EU-backed European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), points to differing labor force structures and working habits as accounting for up to 25% of the difference in the rate of coronavirus cases.
Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, with a combined population of around 64 million had reported a total of 36,890 coronavirus cases as of Thursday. The United Kingdom, with a population of over 66 million, had 267,240 cases and Italy, with around 60 million people, had 231,139.
A number of factors have contributed to the lower rates of infection in central and eastern Europe, researchers say, most importantly early, strict lockdown measures.
Lewandowski says eastern Europe also has a higher share of agricultural and manufacturing jobs which require contact with fewer people than the service sector jobs that dominate western economies.
Yet there is a general consensus among company leaders and governments that as staff begin to return, workplaces will need to incorporate social distancing.
Lewandowski's calculations based on EWCS data showed that before the lockdowns, the share of legal, social and cultural professionals who met clients a few times a month in the United Kingdom and Italy was 79% and 73% respectively. In the Czech Republic it was 38% and in Poland 47%.
""Certainly the London working culture is more sociable, there's more after-hours drinking, more lunching and getting out and meeting clients,"" said Michael Dembinski, chief advisor at the British Polish Chamber of Commerce.
Not everyone is enthusiastic about the increased social-distancing that will be needed at work during the pandemic.
Tomasz Szala, 40, an IT consultant based near the southern Polish city of Wroclaw, who works from home, said: ""I would like to change to some regular team which is having regular meetings face-to-face and not on Skype or Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Hangouts.""

NEW DELHI/CHENNAI (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) has agreed to settle a long-running dispute with the Indian state of Tamil Nadu after claiming it was owed 50 billion rupees ($660 million) in unpaid dues and damages, six sources told Reuters.
As part of the settlement, the Japanese automaker is expected to receive between 14 billion rupees ($185 million) and 18 billion rupees ($238 million), two sources aware of the matter said. 
The dispute arose after Nissan said Tamil Nadu hadn't paid certain incentives under a 2008 agreement to set up a car plant in the southern state.
Nissan initiated an international arbitration against India in 2016, claiming 21 billion rupees in unpaid dues and 29 billion rupees in damages and other costs. Tamil Nadu has been trying to reach a settlement with Nissan for several years. 
Tamil Nadu industries minister M C Sampath confirmed to Reuters that the state had resolved the issue with Nissan but declined to give the settlement amount, citing confidentiality.
""Nissan has begun the process to withdraw the international arbitration,"" he said.
Nissan in India did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The full terms of the settlement were not immediately clear and Reuters could not independently verify them.
The settlement brings to an end a dispute that had raised concerns among investors over the sanctity of contracts.
It is one of a string of arbitration proceedings against India by investors including  Vodafone  Group (L:VOD),  Cairn Energy  (L:CNE) and Deutsche Telekom (DE:DTEGn) over issues ranging from retrospective taxation to payment disputes.
Nissan and its partner France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) invested 61 billion rupees to set up the car manufacturing plant which has an annual production capacity of 480,000 vehicles and has created more than 40,000 jobs. 
The plant is on the outskirts of Chennai, a city often called India's ""Detroit"" because of the presence of several auto manufacturers including  Ford Motor Co  (N:F),  Hyundai Motor  (KS:005380) and BMW (DE:BMWG). 
Nissan, which sells its Kicks sport-utility vehicle in India, has less than 1% of the passenger vehicle market. It lags most major global automakers in India, including its partner Renault which has more than 3% of the market.
For Nissan, the settlement also comes at a time when the company is reeling from slumping sales and profits, made worse by the pandemic. It reported its first loss in 11 years on Thursday.
Nissan's plan to withdraw its arbitration against India will be seen as a victory for the government considering the amount the company was seeking in damages, two sources said.
""Such a settlement also helps reverse the reputational damage to the state's and country's image and boosts investor confidence,"" said one of the sources. 
Tamil Nadu's Sampath said the payout would not affect the state's finances at a time when it is dealing with the coronavirus crisis. The payment will be made from a separate fund of 25 billion rupees which the state has allocated for auto sector incentives, he said.

1086,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Latin America grabs world spotlight for airline bankruptcies,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines (SN:LTM) and Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) survived the Great Depression, but just a few weeks of quarantines forced both companies into bankruptcy, marking Latin America as the world's top spot for airline financial ruin. 
Their bankruptcy filings this month are now set to have a ripple effect on United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), whose untimely bets on the future of Latin American air travel could cost them billions. 
Hopes for a taxpayer rescue in the region are fading fast and the bankruptcies show that even Latin America's two largest carriers are not immune to collapse, even as many airlines in the United States and Europe have received government aid. 
Both LATAM and Avianca said they will continue flying as they restructure their debts in bankruptcy court. 
LATAM alone accounts for 40% of passengers traveling within Latin America and its bankruptcy startled many investors while dealing a fresh blow to Airbus (PA:AIR), which counts LATAM and Avianca as top clients. 
""The air travel sector will not survive without government help,"" Jerome Cadier, LATAM's Brazil CEO, told Reuters. 
He has been in bailout talks for two months and counting, while much of Latin America's air space remains subject to heavy travel restrictions, even as other parts of the world reopen. 
Latin America was already the world's least profitable region for carriers before the crisis, hurt by volatile currencies, high taxes and a crippling recession in its biggest economy, Brazil. 
Still, it has long been viewed as a region of great potential, enough so to tempt Delta and United into spending mightily to unseat American Airlines (O:AAL) as the top U.S. carrier for travel to Latin America. 
'STRATEGIC COMPANY'
Delta bought 20% of LATAM in December while United struck a partnership with Avianca in 2018, but only after agreeing to finance the personal business interests of its Bolivian-born owner.
Three billion dollars later, both U.S. carriers still lack clearance to coordinate flights with their partners. At today's prices, Delta could buy LATAM almost four over with the money it spent on its small stake. United could buy Avianca over 20 times.
If you had invested $100 in Avianca at the beginning of this year, you would have $6.50 today. At its height LATAM boasted of being the world's second airline by market value. 
Partly due to LATAM's size, analysts say, the company's shares did not fall as much in the leadup to the bankruptcy as those of its peers. 
""These were speculators betting on a bailout,"" said Cristian Araya of Chilean brokerage Vantrust Capital. 
Chile, where millions collectively own 15% of LATAM through retirement funds, this week declared it a ""strategic company"" but stopped short of rescuing it. Colombia has made no such noises about Avianca.
Combined, LATAM and Avianca still employ over 60,000 people, although most of them are either earning half their usual paycheck or none at all. 
EMERGENCY MEETINGS
On Monday, LATAM's board sat for its 10th emergency meeting since April to formalize the bankruptcy decision.
The announcement stunned many, with shares of the airline falling more than 60% since Tuesday. 
Earlier this week, Raymond James analysts still had an ""outperform"" rating on the stock, predicting LATAM's shares would double and calling its debt ""manageable."" 
But LATAM's cash crunch and debt crisis were more severe than previously known, according to its bankruptcy filing. 
The airline had missed debt payments, scaring banks and aircraft lessors. It had already spent its emergency credit line back in April. Shareholders had overruled LATAM's board to pay themselves dividends the airline could not afford. 
Without a bankruptcy filing, LATAM would have had to pay some $200 million in expenses by next week, almost a third of the total cash held by the airline's subsidiaries participating in the bankruptcy. 
At the same time, Delta abandoned a prior agreement to buy four Airbus A350 planes that LATAM did not want, paying a fee worth only a fraction of the aircraft's price. LATAM wants to immediately return 15 Airbus planes, Avianca another 8. 
""In hindsight I think what we missed is that (LATAM) really needs to become a much smaller airline,"" Savanthi Syth, an analyst at Raymond James, said in an interview. 
Cadier told Reuters he expects LATAM to shrink by up to 40%, which will include layoffs. 
In a note downgrading LATAM after the bankruptcy, Raymond James said it had good news about Brazil rivals Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4),  Azul SA  (N:AZUL) and Panamanian Copa Holdings (N:CPA). 

""We do not expect similar (bankruptcy) filings,"" it said.

1087,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Home trading triggers bank 'black hole' surveillance alerts,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Potential breaches of market rules have spiked since traders began working from home in March, drawing scrutiny from regulators and piling pressure on banks to plug ""black holes"" in surveillance systems, industry officials say.
With banks unable to check in person on the behavior of traders working remotely, they have to rely on machines that flag any apparent bad behavior or suspicious transactions made under the unusual coronavirus crisis working conditions.
""In your kitchen or spare bedroom there is no colleague to monitor what you are up to and what we are seeing across a number of clients is a spike in escalations,"" said Erkin Adylov, CEO of Behavox, whose software is by banks, hedge funds and asset managers in New York, London and Asia to monitor staff.
Behavox has seen an 18% rise in conduct being ""escalated"" or singled out for scrutiny among clients since March, ranging from swearing to more serious incidents like disclosing client names.
They have also included prohibited activities such as taking conversations private, using personal email and giving financial advice to family and friends, Adylov said.
""These kinds of breaches typically don't happen, but right now there is a noticeable increase,"" he said.
When the coronavirus crisis hit, regulators in Europe and the United States initially gave some leeway to home traders, such as easing a rule that all conversations be recorded.
But working from home must not mean a relaxation in surveillance and firms could hold retrospective reviews to focus on high risk areas, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority said this week, adding it was aware of a surveillance alert surge.
Greenwich Associates said there has been a jump in ""false positives"" or potentially suspicious trades that must be reviewed, driven by record trading volumes during March. 
The consultancy said one global banking client saw more than 35,000 false positives during just one trading day in March, up from 5,000 in a normal session, leading to delays in reviews by compliance teams.
""They normally review an alert on the same day, but in some cases it was two to three weeks later,"" Danielle Tierney, senior analyst at Greenwich said.
Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission said on Thursday that remote working policies due to the pandemic have caused an increase in operational risk and that a ""regulatory conversation"" was needed with financial firms.
Greenwich's Tierney said firms that struggled to stay on top of surveillance will be under pressure from regulators to upgrade systems and will not be simply ""forgiven"" again for lapses next time round.
ALERT SPIKE
Tim Estes, executive chairman of Digital Reasoning, whose programs monitor staff at global banks, said banks were still digging through backlogs from an ""incredible spike"" in alerts, hiring teams in cheaper locations to do initial reviews.
""They know that within the enormous backlogs there are likely incidents of insider trading or market abuse,"" he said.
Rachel Sexton, head of consultants EY's financial services forensic and integrity practice in London, said some processes have been harder to implement in lockdown, such as the control of inside information
Britain's FCA this week told bankers to have adequate systems at home to stop inside information leaks.

""What we will see in the next couple of months is regulators pro-actively issuing more work-from-home guidance,"" said Robert Santella chief executive of IPC Systems, a supplier of kit for traders working from home in the U.S. and Europe.

The hospitality trade has been among the worst-hit of all sectors of the economy by the restrictions that were imposed in March to help prevent the pandemic overwhelming Germany's healthcare system.
The measure, passed in parliament by a wide majority on Thursday, cuts the sales tax restaurant guests pay on food to 7% from 19%.
Restaurants have re-opened to eat-in guests, though rules requiring a minimum distance between tables continue to weigh on profits in the sector. Industry associations warn that swathes of businesses in the sector are on the brink of bankruptcy.

Then it changed its executives' pay packages - handing them a multimillion-dollar windfall.
On April 10, Sonic's board gave its top executives stock options to replace performance-based share awards, regulatory filings show. The options it gave Chief Executive David Smith, whose family controls the company, are now worth about $5.16 million - more than four times the value of the performance-based stock awards he got last year.
Some of Sonic's terminated employees, meanwhile, face hard times. After a decade of buying and selling cars, Allan Nadohl, 74, said he was laid off in March and now relies on U.S. government retirement payments that don't fully cover his bills in Los Angeles.
""Be a mensch,"" Nadohl said, referring to Sonic executives with a Yiddish word meaning honorable person. ""Take a 50% cut for six months.""
Sonic said in one of the filings that the changes were made in response to the pandemic, without elaborating. Neither the company nor Smith responded to requests for comment from Reuters.
Sonic is one of six U.S. companies identified in a Reuters review of regulatory filings that have moved to shield their executives' compensation from the pandemic's economic fallout as they laid off or furloughed workers. The others include plush toy seller  Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc  (N:BBW), restaurant operator  Red Robin Gourmet  Burgers Inc (O:RRGB), retailer Signet Jewelers Ltd (N:SIG), fashion brand DKNY owner G-III Apparel Group Ltd (O:GIII) and fracking sand producer  Covia  Holdings Corp (N:CVIA).
Reuters found 75 other companies that disclosed they are considering changes to executive pay plans in light of the pandemic's impact on their businesses. Among them are ridesharing giant  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), hotel operator  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings Inc (N:HLT), carrier Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), satellite radio company Sirius XM Holdings Inc (O:SIRI) and  Thomson Reuters Corp  (TO:TRI), the parent company of Reuters News.
In an April 21 filing, for example, Sirius XM said it ""may be prudent"" to change executive pay terms to ensure it can attract and retain ""senior management talent."" Delta said in a filing that its performance measures no longer suited the ""current reality"" and that the value of executives' incentive pay had declined by more than half in the pandemic.
Sirius XM did not comment in response to requests from Reuters, and Delta declined to comment. G-III and Signet said the changes were needed to retain management talent, while Build-A-Bear said the moves aligned the interests of executives with shareholders. Covia, Red Robin, Uber and Hilton said in filings that uncertainty arising from the pandemic caused them to revisit performance pay.
Thomson Reuters said in a filing that it had approved executive performance targets in February and early March without the benefit of being able to consider the pandemic's impact on its business, which it said it would continue to monitor and assess. David Crundwell, a vice president for corporate affairs, referred to the filing and declined to comment further.
Reuters identified the companies by searching filings submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission this year and finding those that mentioned the pandemic in the context of executive compensation. The findings are a sampling and do not include companies that may have changed executive pay without explicitly tying the moves to the pandemic.
Critics say protecting executives' pay in downturns undermines practices intended to tie compensation to shareholder returns. Nell Minow, vice chair of corporate governance consultant ValueEdge Advisors, said such plans need both an upside and a downside.
""Otherwise, there is no point,"" she said.
Others counter that the moves to protect executive pay might serve investors as well as executives. 
""It's critical to motivate the team and get through the crisis,"" said Yonat Assayag, partner at pay consultant ClearBridge Compensation Group. ""Through that lens, a lot of these decisions are very much aligned with shareholder interests.""
To be sure, many top executives will likely see their pay go down this year because of dwindling profits and lower share prices, and some companies' compensation changes may not fully make up for the pandemic's impact on executive pay.

More than 500 companies in the Russell 3000 index have announced cuts to the base salaries of their chief executives, to save money or show they are sharing workers' pain, according to compensation consultant Semler Brossy. Base salaries, however, account for only a tenth of the median pay of chief executives at the largest 500 U.S. companies, according to research firm Equilar. They earn the bulk of their compensation through stock awards. 
GIVING OUT STOCK AFTER SALARY CUTS
Build-A-Bear, which sells customized stuffed animals, announced a 20% executive salary reduction in March as it furloughed more than 90% of its 4,300 workers. That translated to a cut of $142,800 from the $714,000 salary of CEO Sharon John.
Two weeks later, however, the company granted its top brass stock grants of roughly equivalent value to the salary cuts.
Build-A-Bear did not respond to requests for comment. In a securities filing on May 1, the company said the stock awards were made ""to further align the interests"" of executives and shareholders.
Many companies have not made decisions on whether and how to adjust executive pay amid the pandemic. Investors and corporate governance experts said they are watching closely.
""We will look very hard at the outcomes of 2020 awards,"" said Hans-Christoph Hirt, head of the stewardship and engagement arm of asset manager Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), which has $606 billion in assets under management. ""We wouldn't want to see targets lowered on the fly.""
Vanguard, the world's largest mutual fund firm, said on its website earlier this month that it was not appropriate for boards to create ""easier"" executive performance targets, despite the challenging environment.
Sonic moved to protect executive pay on April 10, a few weeks after it started layoffs and furloughs of what would eventually total about 3,000 employees, company filings show.
The previous pay plan would have awarded stock to executives based on earnings. Sonic replaced it with options that gave executives the right to buy company stock, starting in 2021, at the beaten-down price the shares hit on April 9 of this year - at the height of the pandemic, when their value had been halved from their most recent peak.
Sonic's shares have risen 67% since April 10, as much of the stock market has recovered on the Federal Reserve's intervention and massive government stimulus spending. Smith said on the company's first-quarter earnings call on April 30 that sales had dropped about 40% year-on-year since the start of the pandemic. 
Sonic's pay changes are ""pretty egregious,"" Aaron Bertinetti, head of research and engagement at proxy advisor Glass, Lewis & Co. 
'FAIR AND REALISTIC'
Covia, a materials supplier to the energy industry, has cut at least 7% of its workforce of about 2,662 employees in the crisis. The company said that the pandemic and volatile oil markets had ""rendered obsolete"" its performance-based incentive program for executives, including CEO Richard Navarre. Instead, the company's board approved payments to the top executives equaling what they would have earned if they had achieved their 2020 performance targets. 
For Navarre, this amounted to a $4.36 million immediate payout. A Covia spokesman declined to comment on behalf of the company and Navarre.
Other firms made more modest changes that cushioned the blow for executives without making them whole for any pandemic-related loss of pay.
DKNY's parent G-III Apparel switched from performance-based to time-based share awards, assuring pay for executives who remain with the company for three years. The company said in a regulatory filing that the ""significant retention benefit"" outweighs any concerns over removing performance requirements from the grants.
G-III CEO Morris Goldfarb, who owns about 8% of the company, had earlier given up a $1 million annual cash salary as part of steps the firm said it took to increase ""financial flexibility."" The company also said that cash incentive payments to Goldfarb - which accounted for about 70% of his $16.6 million total pay last year - could be reduced this year because of the pandemic's impact on company performance.
Removing the performance requirement from Goldfarb's stock awards will protect a substantial portion of his pay. Last year, he earned $4 million in performance-based shares; this year, the changes give him $3.7 million in time-based shares.
G-III furloughed and laid off between 60% and 80% of employees, depending on the segment of its wholesale and retail operations.
A G-III spokesman said the new arrangement was made ""in recognition of record-breaking results"" in the 12 months ending in January and to assure stability in management.
Signet Jewelers is also giving executives more shares based on time, and less on performance, which could help blunt the impact of the economic crisis on their pay. Time-vesting shares made up 35% of executives' long-term incentive plan before the pandemic, with the balance of the stock awards linked to profitability measures. The new structure gives time-vesting and performance shares equal weighting. The changes mean Signet CEO Virginia Drosos would get $900,000 more in time-based stock awards for this year if Signet maintains compensation targets it used for the previous fiscal year, ended Feb. 1. 
The jeweler also cut top executives' base cash salaries by half, including that of Drosos, who last year received $1.5 million in base salary. But the firm said in a filing that it will also award executives additional shares worth about a quarter of their cash salary. 
More than half of Signet Jewelers' about 23,000 employees in North America have been furloughed, according to a company spokesman.
Nancy Reardon, who chairs Signet's compensation committee, said the changes were meant to retain management talent and give executives ""fair and realistic"" goals in light of the pandemic. Company spokeswoman Colleen Rooney said the company had business reasons beyond the pandemic for changing executive compensation and that the adjustments could translate to lower pay if the company performs well.
Red Robin said on April 14 that it would eliminate 50 restaurant support positions and cut pay by 20% for support and supervision workers in response to the pandemic, matching an earlier 20% cut to executive base salaries. It also closed 35 of the 454 restaurants it operates and furloughed or re-assigned an undisclosed number of workers. 
Red Robin said in an April 8 regulatory filing that it replaced targets based on company earnings with metrics that compare performance to corporate peers, which faced similar challenges in the pandemic. The change likely will reduce the pandemic's impact for CEO Paul Murphy, who negotiated a cash-and-stock package estimated at $7 million annually when he joined the company in October.

In a filing, the company called the changes appropriate given the economic uncertainty and the difficulty in crafting new metrics. A company spokesman declined further comment.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open cautiously Thursday, consolidating ahead of the latest weekly jobless claims data and as tensions between the U.S. and China ratchet up.
At 07:00 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 5 points, or 0.2%, higher, the Dow Futures contract rose 124 points, or 0.5%, while Nasdaq Futures fell 19 points, or 0.2%.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is once again beating predecessor Barack Obama in stock market performance following a stunning recovery on Wall Street.
After a 1.5% jump on Wednesday, the S&P 500 is now up about 42% since Trump, a Republican, was elected in November 2016, compared with the benchmark's 31% gain during the same amount of time after Obama, a Democrat, was elected in 2008. 
While the S&P 500 has surged 36% from its March lows and the Nasdaq Composite is just 4% short of record highs, investors remain wary of a deep and extended economic slump resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.
(GRAPHIC: Trump vs Obama's Wall St gains - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xegvbyyzmpq/Trump%20vs%20Obama.jpg)
For over three years, Trump repeatedly highlighted on Twitter and to reporters the stock market’s stunning run-up, citing it as evidence of his success in the White House and making it part of his case for re-election this November.
Fueled by deep corporate tax cuts, the S&P 500 at its peak on Feb. 19 was up 58% from when Trump beat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in 2016.
But the stock market slump caused by fears related to the coronavirus and its crippling economic impact erased almost all of those gains in March, ending an 11-year bull market. At its recent bottom on March 23, the S&P 500 was up less than 5% since Trump's election. 
With job losses at their worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s, Trump on Twitter this week highlighted the market's most recent gains, linking them to his push to reopen the economy. Earlier this month in another tweet, he blamed stock market declines on short sellers manipulating the market.

As measured from his inauguration in January 2017, Trump's stock market performance continues to trail Obama's, with the S&P 500 up 34% under Trump and 64% under Obama.

1096,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Amazon to offer permanent roles to 70% of 175,000 new U.S. hires","By Jeffrey Dastin
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) plans to offer permanent jobs to about 70% of the U.S. workforce it has hired temporarily to meet consumer demand during the coronavirus pandemic, the company told Reuters on Thursday.
The world's largest online retailer will begin telling 125,000 warehouse employees in June that they can keep their roles longer-term. The remaining 50,000 workers it has brought on will stay on seasonal contracts that last up to 11 months, a company spokeswoman said.
The decision is a sign that Amazon's sales have increased sufficiently to justify an expanded workforce for order fulfillment, even as government lockdowns ease and rivals open their retail stores for pickup.
Amazon started the hiring spree in March with a blog post appealing to workers laid off by restaurants and other shuttered businesses, promising employment ""until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back.""
Seattle-based Amazon did not disclose how much it was spending to make the positions permanent and whether that cost would be in addition to the $4 billion it has forecast for virus-related expenses.
The permanent roles come with benefits that seasonal workers lack, such as employer-offered health insurance and retirement plans.
Some Amazon staff, unions and elected officials have said the company has put employees' health at risk by keeping nearly all its warehouses operational during the pandemic. At least 800 U.S.-based workers have tested positive for the highly contagious virus, according to figures compiled by one employee, which Amazon has not commented on.
The company has increased cleaning, added social distancing measures and offered face masks, fever checks and virus tests in response.

Amazon said it had 840,400 full and part-time staff at the end of last quarter while it still was in the process of hiring. It has not reported an updated number.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co outlined a new plan on Thursday to become a smaller, more cost-efficient carmaker after the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated a slide in profitability that culminated in its first annual loss in 11 years.
Under a new four-year plan, the Japanese manufacturer will slash its production capacity and model range by about a fifth to help cut 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion) from fixed costs. 
It will shut plants in Spain and Indonesia, leave the South Korean market and pull its Datsun brand from Russia as part of a strategy unveiled on Wednesday to share production globally with its partners  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF).
""I will make every effort to return Nissan to a growth path,"" Nissan Chief Executive Makoto Uchida said, adding that the company had learned from its past mistakes of chasing global market share at all costs.
""We must admit failures and take corrective actions,"" he said, adding that starting with top-level managers, the company had to break its inward-looking culture which in the past has stymied efforts to deepen cooperation with France's Renault.
Uchida said improving the company's cash flow was its biggest challenge. He reiterated that Nissan's cash liquidity was good even though it had negative free cash flow of 641 billion yen in the year ended in March.
Nissan declined to give any forecasts for its current financial year which started in April due to the uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic. It also declined to give details on how many jobs it was cutting.
In what is Nissan's second recovery plan in less than a year, Uchida pledged a return to profitability with a core operating profit margin above 5% and a sustainable global market share of 6% under 
Nissan posted an annual operating loss of 40.5 billion yen for the year to March 31, its worst performance since 2008/09. Its operating profit margin was -0.4%.
The automaker said on Thursday that it sold 4.9 million vehicles last year, up from an earlier estimate of 4.8 million.
That was still the second decline in a row and a fall of 11% from the previous period but meant Nissan clung on to its position as Japan's second biggest carmaker, just ahead of Honda and a long way behind Toyota.
PANDEMIC PRESSURE
Even before the spread of the novel coronavirus, Nissan's slumping profits had forced it to row back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn. The pandemic has only piled on the urgency to downsize.
Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi Motors said on Wednesday they would work more closely on developing and producing cars to reduce costs and ensure their alliance's continued existence. 
Renault is due to announce its own restructuring plans on Friday which are expected to include job cuts despite resistance from the French government.
Nissan's operating profit has tumbled for four consecutive years as its pursuit of market share, particularly in the United States, led to overcapacity at its car plants, steep discounting and a cheapened brand.
The new four-year plan is the vision of Uchida and Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta, who took over after months of internal turmoil following Ghosn's arrest in 2018.
Under the plan, Nissan will curb its ambitions for sales growth to target annual sales of about 5 million units, Reuters reported in April, a cut from a previous goal of 6 million cars outlined in July by then-CEO Hiroto Saikawa.
Spain said on Thursday that the closure of Nissan's plant in Barcelona could cost the company as much as 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) and that investing in the factory would be a cheaper alternative.
Protesting workers burned tyres and blocked the entrance to the Barcelona factory following the announcement.

1098,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>","GM, Ford turn to fast-payment programs to aid suppliers hit by shutdowns","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) are using fast-payment programs set up with financial lenders to help cash-strapped small suppliers survive production shutdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Keeping small suppliers afloat financially is critical for the automakers as they try to restart North American factories and generate cash from sales of large pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. 
The programs pay suppliers up front for bills that typically take 40 to 60 days to settle. For many suppliers, checks for the last work done prior to the shutdown of North American auto plants arrived earlier this month, and no new payments would land until July or August. 
GM started its ""Early Payment Program"" last August with  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC), and now is using it as a way to support suppliers during the pandemic, especially as they roll out new technologies, GM spokesman David Barnas said. GM operated a similar program with  General Electric  Co (N:GE) prior to 2008.
Under the deal, a supplier gets an earlier payment from Wells Fargo for the full invoice, after paying a financing fee. GM later pays Wells Fargo the full amount. 
Ford's program works similarly. 
GM said the cost of financing under its program is linked to the automaker's credit rating and not the supplier's, allowing the smaller companies to leverage GM's financial strength and achieve lower costs. It did not disclose other financial details.
Seventeen suppliers have participated in GM's program and another two dozen are in talks to join as interest has increased during the COVID-19 outbreak, Barnas said. 
Some supplier executives and analysts compared the potential cost of taking accelerated payments to credit-card debt. Some of these programs can cost more than a line of credit with interest rates in some cases running as high as 3% to 4% per 30 days. 
""It is not a silver bullet,"" said Scott Eisenberg, partner with restructuring advisory firm Amherst Partners.
The pressure on suppliers may only increase in the third quarter as banks pull back on making loans, Eisenberg said. ""If we have this second (coronavirus) wave in the fall, the access to capital that everyone had in March won't be the same in September and October."" 
Bob Roth, co-owner of RoMan Manufacturing, which makes transformers and glass molding equipment in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said companies with stronger balance sheets, like his, can avoid such deals. But others have no option.
""The cost of such deals compared to the cost of being out of business is not really a choice,"" he said.
Ford launched its program late last week, initially with a small group of suppliers that ship to its U.S. plants with the intent of expanding more broadly in the future, spokeswoman Jennifer Flake said.
Ford is working with London-based Greensill, which provides working capital finance for businesses globally, and financial technology company C2FO, she said. Greensill declined to comment. 

 Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) said only that it is using ""myriad"" approaches to support struggling suppliers.

Renault, which posted its first net loss in a decade in 2019, has like Nissan been struggling with faltering sales, a slide exacerbated this year by the coronavirus pandemic.
The two firms, which this week announced plans for more production sharing under their three-way alliance with Japan's Mitsubishi Motors (T:7211) in a bid to cut costs, are also embarking on individual restructuring and savings plans. 
Nissan posted an annual operating loss of 40.5 billion yen ($376 million) for the year to March 31, its worst performance since 2008/09, while net losses came in at 671.2 billion yen.

IASB accounting rules are mandatory in more than 140 countries, including Britain, the European Union and Canada, but not in the United States, which has its own regulations.
""The amendment is designed to make it easier for lessees, especially those with a lot of lease contracts, to account for covid-19-related rent concessions,"" IASB Chair Hans Hoogervorst said in a statement on Thursday.
Coronavirus lockdowns have led retailers and others companies to request rent holidays or cuts on their shop leases.
A skipped rent payment would normally trigger a ""modification"" in a lease, forcing the lessee to review the contract to see if investors need updating.
The IASB said the amendment to its lease standard is effective from June 1 and can apply immediately in any financial statements, interim or annual, not yet authorised for issue.

1101,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>","EasyJet to cut 4,500 jobs to stay competitive after crisis","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's easyJet (L:EZJ) plans to cut up to 4,500 jobs and shrink its fleet to adjust to the smaller travel market which is forecast to emerge from the coronavirus crisis. 
EasyJet, which employs more than 15,000 people in eight countries across Europe, is moving later than others in announcing job cuts as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought airlines across the world to their knees.
Most have been forced to cut jobs, including more than 15,000 in Britain, as they prepare for a market which is not forecast to return to 2019 levels until 2023.
EasyJet, which said on Thursday it would launch a consultation process with staff, also plans to shrink its fleet by 15% to 302 planes by the end of 2021 and to cut costs through deals with airports, maintenance suppliers and in marketing. 
Shares in easyJet rose 6% to 751 pence, their highest level since mid-March, before coronavirus grounded its fleet.
""Exactly the kind of overhaul the cost base needs,"" Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said of easyJet's cuts, which go deeper than those of Ryanair (I:RYA) and Wizz Air (L:WIZZ), who have said they will lay off 15% and 19% of staff respectively.
EasyJet said it expects to be flying around 30% of its capacity by the fourth quarter, which leaves it trailing Ryanair which is planning to fly 40% in July.
""The leverage to growing market share over the next two years seems to rest with Ryanair and Wizz, who see their cost bases as allowing them to exploit this crisis,"" Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said. 
EasyJet Chief Executive Johan Lundgren said that job cuts would ensure easyJet emerges as ""a more competitive business"". Around 8,000 of its staff are based in Britain. 
Lundgren told reporters that easyJet was talking to the British government about a 14-day quarantine rule which airlines say will further stifle any travel recovery.
Over the last six weeks easyJet has also been grappling with an attempt by its biggest shareholder to oust its senior bosses, and the fallout from a cyber attack.
It said talks with lessors interested in acquiring aircraft on a sale and leaseback basis are ongoing and proceeds would now be 500 million pounds to 650 million pounds ($798 million), around 25% higher than expected in April.

1102,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Japanese automakers' April sales more than halved,"(Reuters) - Global auto sales for Japanese carmakers more than halved in April as the coronavirus pandemic forced governments to impose lockdowns that left streets empty and showrooms deserted.
Japan's top eight automakers together posted a decline of 54.4% in April sales, according to a Reuters calculation. 
Toyota Motor's (T:7203) worldwide sales including units Daihatsu and Hino (T:7205) fell 45% to 472,703 vehicles - the fourth straight month of declines. Toyota's performance was dragged down by a 51% slump in sales outside Japan.
Japan's largest automaker this month said it expected profit this year to drop by 80% to its lowest in nine years, underscoring the challenge that even the most profitable carmakers are having to contend with during the pandemic.
Auto sales have slumped all around the world, including the two biggest markets, China and the United States.
While China reported an upturn in April auto sales from a year earlier by virtue of pent up demand after weeks of lockdown, annual sales could still fall by 15-25%. 
Auto retail sales in the United States are likely to have halved in April, according to analytics firm J.D. Power. However, sales in May are expected to improve as most carmakers offer attractive incentives to boost demand as lockdowns ease.
Honda Motor's (T:7267) global April sales fell 43% and Nissan Motor (T:7201) sold nearly 42% fewer cars than the same month last year.
Nissan on Thursday posted its first annual loss in 11 years and unveiled a plan to become a smaller, more cost-efficient automaker.

1103,By Investing.com,"<span>May 28, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Airline Bounce Is Proving a Bumpy Ride,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- That airline bounce is already running into trouble.
The sector has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rotation into cyclical stocks over the last week, supported by announcements of flight resumptions and lockdown restrictions that will allow the industry to salvage at least some of the summer tourist season.
But individual companies aren’t out of the woods yet. Scandinavian flag carrier SAS (ST:SAS) fell 7.3% on Thursday morning after saying it would need more money from its biggest shareholders.
The governments of Sweden and Denmark both own stakes of between 14% and 15%, while Foundation Asset Management, an investment arm of the Wallenberg family, holds another 6.5%. The first two have already underwritten over $300 million in loans to the group since the pandemic struck.
Even though the European Union has relaxed its rules on state aid to help industry get through the crisis, that won’t be an easy sell: SAS had lost money already before the crisis started.
Meanwhile, Norwegian Air Shuttle  (OL:NWC), which has only just fended off bankruptcy with a state-backed loan after a series of recapitalizations and debt restructurings, fell 7.4% after its first-quarter results were every bit as bad as feared, including a pretax loss of 3.3 billion kroner ($334 million) and the complete absence of guidance.
Both are still up smartly on the week – SAS stock has gained 14% and Norwegian Air Shuttle stock 45% - but the sharp moves downward underline how the stocks have essentially become a plaything for thrill-seekers rather than a secure long-term investment.
Across the Baltic, things are also looking less good for Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), whose board has had to put off approval of its 9 billion-euro ($10 billion) bailout by the German government because of antitrust concerns in Brussels.
The EU has asked Lufthansa to give up lucrative slots at its hubs in Frankfurt and Munich in order to ensure a minimum degree of competition. However, the German government is determined to keep out low-cost airlines, the likeliest buyers of those slots, fearing a long-term slide towards job losses and the spread of looser employment relations in the sector.
Ryanair (LON:RYA) has already threatened to challenge the bailout in court.
Lufthansa has an effective monopoly on domestic flights within Germany after absorbing most of Air Berlin with government support three years ago. Domestic flights, which had come under fire before the pandemic because of their carbon footprint, have become more important for airlines since the pandemic because it’s where demand, and thus cash flow, is expected to recover first.
""We expect that the recovery will start with increased domestic demand followed by European and then intercontinental destinations,"" SAS said on Thursday.
That scenario would be bad news for Norwegian, given that its big hope was to gather market share on the lucrative transatlantic market.
Air France, earlier this month, had managed to get its bailout through the Brussels process by promising to end shorter domestic flights (an arrangement that suits the French government because passengers are most likely to revert to the state-owned high-speed train network).
However, there are signs that the market is still prepared to back airlines that can adapt convincingly to the new situation. EasyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) stock rose 5.4% by mid-morning after saying it will cut up to 30% of its workforce – the equivalent of 4,500 jobs – to bring its cost base into line with reduced demand forecasts. It also raised its guidance for savings through deals to sell and lease-back some of its aircraft. That should reduce the company’s cash burn considerably as it prepares to resume flights in July. But given that it will still be operating at only 30% of capacity through the peak quarter, it should be no surprise if further measures are necessary later."

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose for the fourth straight session on Thursday and the euro perched at a two-month high, as businesses returning to work and a 750 billion euro EU stimulus plan outweighed rising U.S.-China tensions.
Asian markets had been subdued overnight after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had warned Hong Kong no longer warranted special treatment under U.S. law, but there was no stopping Europe.
Traders diving back into the markets after Wednesday's EU plan to prop up the bloc's coronavirus-hit economies pushed the region-wide STOXX 600 index up 1% to its highest since early March. 
The euro enjoyed the view at $1.1016, having risen to a two-month high. It also held at the near three-month high it had hit versus the neighbouring Swiss franc the previous day, while the dollar was largely quiet.
Euro zone bond yields were relatively stable too, with Italian borrowing costs - a key European confidence indicator - holding near eight-week lows and safe-haven German Bunds seeing another small sell-off. 
""With the release now of the European Commission’s plan for COVID recovery, we see there being room for further positivity in Eurozone risk assets, even while the global sentiment is buffeted by China-related tensions,"" Mizuho analysts told clients.
""This feeds directly into our expectations for European risk assets to outperform, which will be further helped by a likely expansion of ECB QE next week.""
Overnight, MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had ended flat, having been in positive territory earlier in the day. 
Shares in Hong Kong skidded as much 1.75% before ending down a 0.7% as Chinese shares managed to close positive. [.SS]. Japan's Nikkei had jumped 2.3% though U.S. stock futures lost momentum in Europe to trade only 0.1% higher. 
The biggest risk to equities now looks to be the Sino-U.S. relationship, which is likely to worsen after Pompeo had said on Wednesday that China's plan to impose new security laws in Hong Kong were ""only the latest in a series of actions that fundamentally undermine"" the city's autonomy.
""All eyes remain on the U.S.-China relationship,"" said Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone, a currency broker. ""This is a risk for markets... One questions if the equity markets are too complacent here.""
A punitive U.S. response to China on the issue of Hong Kong could result in a tit-for-tat reaction from Beijing, further straining ties between the world's two biggest economies and hobbling global growth.
President Donald Trump has said he will announce a response to China's policies towards Hong Kong later this week.
Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose slightly to 0.6966%. Although they are up from an all-time low of 0.4980% struck in March, they are still a whopping 120 basis points below highs seen in January.
China's yuan meanwhile was near a record low of 7.1966 per dollar in international markets due to uncertainty over Hong Kong. In 'onshore' trade too, it was nearly at its weakest since the height of the U.S.-China trade war last September.

Commodity markets groaned. U.S. crude futures fell 3.2% to $31.76 a barrel, while Brent crude fell 1.73% to $34.14 per barrel as investors fretted about Trump's response to China.

Investing.com - European stock markets rose Thursday, as policymakers look to inject more stimulus to help the region’s battered economies as they gradually reopen.
At 4:25 AM ET (0725 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 0.8%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.7%.
The EU Commission announced its plan for a European recovery fund Wednesday, exceeding expectations as it offered up 250 billion euros in loans on top of the 500 billion in grants which were originally included in the German-Franco proposal last week. 
If ratified by all, this would be a step towards mutualised debt as a major funding tool for the first time, paving the way for more coordination within the region.
The need for the additional recovery funding was laid bare by the Ifo Institute earlier Thursday, as it said in its latest update that the German economy, the region’s powerhouse, is likely to shrink by 6.6% this year as a consequence of the coronavirus crisis.
On average, businesses expected operations to return to normal in nine months after severe lockdowns in the second quarter, Ifo said. Under this scenario, the economy would shrink 12.4% in the second quarter of this year.
Meanwhile, countries throughout Europe are restarting their economies, with the United Kingdom, now the country with the most confirmed Covid-related deaths in the region, set to loosen its lockdown in June.
In corporate news, EasyJet (LON:EZJ) soared over 8% after the low-cost airline announced plans to cut up to 30% of its workforce. It also said winter bookings are ahead of year-earlier levels, but this reflects to a large degree people who have rebooked earlier flights that were cancelled due to the pandemic.
On the flip side, Rolls-Royce (LON:RR) dropped 4.7% as the engine-maker continues to struggle with the repercussions of the drop in airplane traffic due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Focus later Thursday will turn to the latest initial claims data in the U.S., with an additional 2.1 million people expected to have applied for unemployment benefits last week.
The Labor Department issues the claims numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) as usual.
Oil prices headed lower Thursday, weighed by a surprise addition to crude stocks, according to API data late Wednesday, of 8.7 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for a draw of 1.9 million barrels.
The market will be looking to see if the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s release later Thursday confirms this figure.
At 4:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.3% lower at $31.73 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.7% to $33.80.

(Reuters) - American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc must reduce its management and support staff by about 30% and may have to cut frontline employees as it downsizes due to the coronavirus outbreak, showed a letter to employees made public on Wednesday.
All major U.S. airlines have said they will need to shrink in the fall, once U.S. government payroll aid that bans involuntary job cuts expires on Sept. 30.
Competitor United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc has also said it will need to reduce its management and administrative staff by about 30%.
Despite the bailout and other liquidity raises, American must ""plan for operating a smaller airline for the foreseeable future,"" Executive Vice President of People and Global Engagement Elise Eberwein said in the letter.
American, with over 100,000 employees, will offer voluntary options before implementing involuntary reductions if there is not enough take-up, she said.
Once it has reduced its management ranks, the company will turn to frontline employees including flight attendants and pilots, who will receive fresh voluntary leave and early retirement options in June with the aim of avoiding involuntary furloughs.
""This is a goal, though, not a commitment, and a stretch goal at that,"" Eberwein said, adding the company will be working with unions in coming weeks and months.
American has said it is accelerating fleet retirement and expects to fly roughly 100 fewer aircraft in the summer of 2021. Nearly 40,000 employees have already opted for temporary voluntary leave or early retirement.

Earlier, American Chief Executive Doug Parker said the airline hoped to avoid furloughs and rejected speculation that it or another major U.S. carrier will have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to the coronavirus crisis.

The memory chipmaker said in a regulatory filing https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/723125/000072312520000053/mu-20200527.htm that it expected adjusted earnings between 75 cents per share and 80 cents per share.
""We had strong demand from our customers – notably in the data center space – and that demand has been driven mostly due to the work-from-home economy, the increased load on the server infrastructure because of everyone working from home, entertaining from home,"" Sumit Sadana, Micron's chief business officer, told Reuters in an interview.
Sadana said Micron also saw increased sales of server chips to retailers expanding their e-commerce operations to handle extra demand while many physical retail locations were shuttered during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Micron also saw increased sales of laptop memory chips for work and education at home.
Analysts had expected a revenue of $4.93 billion and adjusted earnings of 56 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
South Korean chip stocks rose on Thursday on Micron's third-quarter revenue guidance. 

Shares of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd (KS:005930), the world's biggest memory chip maker, rose as much as 2.6% to 51,2000 won, while domestic rival SK Hynix (KS:000660) gained 4.4% to 85,000 won by 0109 GMT. The benchmark KOSPI market (KS11) was trading up 0.9%.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese stock prices will likely remain well below pre-coronavirus pandemic peaks until at least the end of next year, a Reuters poll showed on Thursday.
The median estimate of 23 analysts and fund managers polled May 12-26 put the Nikkei benchmark (N225) at 21,000 at the end of 2020.
That would be 2.0% below the index's Wednesday close of 21,419.23 and almost 15% below a February Reuters poll that forecast the year-end index at 24,650. 
The median forecast in the May poll keeps the index at 21,000 through to the end of June next year before it rises to 22,050 by the end of 2021. That is still well below a peak of 24,116 before the pandemic.
Uncertainty generated by the pandemic resulted in a wide range of 2020 end-year forecasts, from 16,000 to 28,000.
""If there is a second wave of infections, markets could falter again but our basic scenario is a sustained rally in share prices,"" said Hiroshi Watanabe, senior economist at  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) Financial.
The Nikkei has been recovering after a more than 32% slide from a peak in January to as low as 16,358 in March, a trough last seen in November 2016.
The Japanese government this week lifted a state of emergency imposed to stop the spread of COVID-19 as the rate of new infections has fallen, allowing for a gradual recovery of economic activity. The domestic economy is expected to contract nearly 6% this financial year, almost as much as it did in 2009. [ECILT/JP]
Hisashi Iwama, senior portfolio manager at Asset Management One, said he could not rule out the Nikkei testing its March low.

""If we have not found effective treatments for the novel coronavirus, in the autumn and winter, we could see the second wave of coronavirus as well as regular flu, causing chaos in hospitals and re-introduction of social restrictions,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who was the largest shareholder in  Hertz Global Holdings  (NYSE:HTZ) Inc, unloaded his entire stake in the rental car company at a ""significant loss"" days after it filed for bankruptcy protection.
According to a regulatory filing https:// made on Wednesday, Icahn, who held a nearly 39% stake in Hertz and had three representatives on the board, sold 55.34 million shares on Tuesday at 72 cents per share. 
Hertz fell victim to coronavirus shutdowns that dramatically curtailed travel and created major financial hardships for the company, Icahn said in the filing, adding that he supported the board's decision to seek bankruptcy protection on Friday.
Even though he suffered heavy losses, which he did not quantify, Icahn said that he still believed in the company and thinks it can be a ""great company"" in the future. At the end of 2019, his stake in Hertz was worth close to $700 million.
""I intend to closely follow the Company’s reorganization and I look forward to assessing different opportunities to support Hertz in the future,"" he said in the filing. He could not be reached for comment on Wednesday evening.
Rumors had circulated for weeks about how Icahn might react as Hertz' troubles mounted and the company replaced its chief executive officer, laid off 10,000 people and warned that there was considerable doubt about its ability to continue operations. The company operates Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty car-rentals.
Icahn declined to comment because his representatives -- Vincent Intrieri, Daniel Ninivaggi and SungHwan Cho -- sit on the board.
Icahn obtained his shares in 2016 when the company was separated from Herc Holdings (NYSE:HRI), where he also had representatives on the board.

Icahn, whose net worth is said to be $14.3 billion, had been fond of saying that investors should buy a stock when his representatives get on the board and not sell until they leave, promising that good things inevitably happen when he becomes involved.

Scores of regional and community titles will be published only digitally from June 29 under the reorganisation, the Australian arm of the mass media and publishing firm News Corp (O:NWSA) said in a statement on Wednesday.
The company did not specify how many jobs could be lost, but Australian media reported up to 1,000 staff could be axed as a result of the restructuring.
It said its print publications had become unsustainable amid the coronavirus pandemic and the loss of revenue to digital platforms that use its content without payment.

(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) plans to reopen the world's largest theme park, Walt Disney World, in phases beginning on July 11, if the governor of Florida approves.
Disney wants to reopen Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom on July 11 and Epcot and Hollywood Studios on July 15, according to Jim MacPhee, senior vice president of operations for the Walt Disney World Resort, who presented plans during a webcast meeting.
The successful reopening of its parks is a signal event for Disney and the rest of the world as governments and companies strategize how to move out of lockdown while the novel coranavirus is still a threat.
After MacPhee's presentation, an Orange County task force OK'd the plan, sending it to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for final approval.
When the Disney parks reopen, guests and employees will be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The resort will suspend parades, fireworks displays and other activities that create crowds. It will ""enable and encourage"" contactless payment systems, and expand its existing mobile order systems in restaurants.
Disney plans to restrict the number of guests, who will be required to reserve their park passes ahead of time. Park guests will be greeted by signs such as ""HELP US PROTECT THE MAGIC PLEASE LIMIT HANDLING OF THE PRODUCT, IF ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED, PLEASE ASK A CAST MEMBER."" 
Starting in January, Disney closed theme parks around the world to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
On Wednesday, Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Chapek told CNBC the company currently has about 20,000 people per day visiting Shanghai Disneyland, which reopened on May 11 with mandatory masks, temperature screenings and social distancing for visitors and employees. 
Disney will soon reveal plans for reopening its Anaheim, California, Disneyland amusement park, the company's original themed attraction, according to a company spokeswoman.
Welcoming visitors again to its parks is key to Disney's recovery from the global shutdowns sparked by the pandemic. Disney has estimated it lost $1 billion at its theme parks division from January through March.

Disney's four Walt Disney World theme parks attracted 157.3 million visitors in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association trade group.

1122,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>","U.S. Will Join G-7 AI Pact, Citing Threat From China","(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. plans to join an international organization that will advise companies and governments on the responsible development of artificial intelligence, becoming the last of the Group of Seven countries to sign on.
The group, called the Global Partnership on AI, will study and provide recommendations to encourage the creation of AI technologies that respect privacy and civil liberties, said Michael Kratsios, the chief technology officer of the U.S. He called the partnership “a first of its kind global organization that sees the future of AI as something that can uplift Americans and people around the world.”
U.S. officials plan to outline their involvement in the program on Thursday at a G-7 meeting of science and technology ministers. In addition to G-7 members, several more countries outside the group, including New Zealand, are expected to eventually join the program. Kratsios acknowledged that the Trump administration had generally been skeptical of multilateral agreements but said that this one was important as a check on China’s approach to AI, which often involves using new technologies to augment an already-robust surveillance state. The Chinese government, Kratsios, said, “has twisted AI in ways that are in direct conflict with the values of the U.S. and its allies.”
Tensions between the U.S. and China, heightened throughout Donald Trump’s presidency, were further escalated in the last week over a Chinese national security law that tightens Beijing’s grip over Hong Kong. Michael Pompeo, the U.S. secretary of state, said Wednesday that the country could no longer certify Hong Kong as politically autonomous, a move that could trigger sanctions.
Kratsios compared the new AI partnership to past U.S.-led efforts to contain China’s influence over 5G wireless technology. Last year, the U.S. and 31 other countries met in Prague and agreed to a set of cybersecurity standards that included warnings about suppliers from countries that do not have adhere to international standards on security and data protection. This was widely seen as a reference to Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., the big Chinese telecom equipment makers. The U.S. has tried to keep the companies out of its own country and international markets, fearing they would create backdoors for Beijing. Both companies have vigorously denied the charges.
The idea of both the 5G and AI initiatives is to set limits on Chinese companies seeking to expand abroad, said Kratsios, a former chief of staff at Thiel Capital, an investment fund backed by Peter Thiel. For years, American tech executives have suggested that Chinese influence could erode free speech around the world because companies in China are required by law to censor politically sensitive topics while allowing authorities access to user data.
The White House has expressed similar concerns. In a speech last year, Kratsios warned that adoption of Chinese standards in 5G and AI could “run the risk of repeating the same mistakes our nations made nearly 20 years ago,” when China joined the World Trade Organization.
The G-7 meeting on Thursday will be led by Kratsios and Kelvin Droegemeier, Trump’s science adviser. The new group will ask member states to follow principles drafted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which recommends developing AI technologies that respect human rights and are transparent to anyone affected by them. The U.S. had initially refused to join the new G-7 partnership, it said, in part out of a concern that the group would conflict with the OECD’s framework. The group’s members will be nominated by each country and composed of experts from academia, business and nonprofits.
Ahead of the meeting, Kratisos said that Covid-19 had made fears about China more urgent, pointing to reports that Beijing had been silencing critics of its coronavirus response, as well as a new software system that tracks citizens and automatically assigns them a color-coded health score, which is then used to limit their movements. “This Covid crisis has put in focus a stark choice,” Kratsios said. “AI must not be a tool to repress people and invade their privacy.”

1123,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 08:15PM ET</span>",Nissan to set out survival plan after expected annual loss,"By Naomi Tajitsu
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) will unveil its plan to become a smaller, more cost-efficient automaker on Thursday as it looks to recover from four years of tumbling profits which are set to culminate in its first annual operating loss in 11 years.
The Japanese carmaker's second recovery plan in less than a year will outline how it will slash fixed costs, streamline its products and shore up cash as it reels from a plunge in sales as the coronavirus pandemic hits demand for cars.
Nissan said in April that it expected to post an annual operating loss of up to 45 billion yen ($417 million) when it announces its results for the year to March 31 at 0800GMT on Thursday, which would be its worst performance since 2008/09.
The automaker sold 4.8 million vehicles in its latest financial year, the second decline in a row and a fall of 13% from last year, knocking it off its perch as Japan's second biggest automaker to trail Toyota (T:7203) and Honda (T:7267).
The plan will follow a new strategy announced by Nissan and its partners  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) on Wednesday to work more closely on developing and producing cars to reduce costs and ensure the group's survival. 
Even before the spread of the coronavirus, Nissan's sales and profits had been slumping, forcing it to row back on an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn.
The pandemic has only piled on the urgency and pressure to renew its efforts to downsize. 
Nissan's operating profit has tumbled for four consecutive years as its pursuit of market share, particularly in the United States, led to overcapacity at its car plants, steep discounting and a cheapened brand.
The three-year strategy will lay out a path to sustainable profitability and is the vision of Chief Executive Makoto Uchida and Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta, who took over after months of internal turmoil following Ghosn's arrest in 2018.
Under the plan, Nissan will curb its ambitions for sales growth to target annual sales of about 5 million units, Reuters reported in April, a cut from a previous goal of 6 million cars outlined in July by then-CEO Hiroto Saikawa. 

Another top priority will be the preservation of cash. As of December, Nissan's automotive operations had negative free cash flow of 670.9 billion yen, a more than six-fold increase from a year ago.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>",U.S. states sue Trump administration over fuel efficiency rollback,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of 23 U.S. states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit on Wednesday challenging a Trump administration decision to weaken Obama-era fuel efficiency standards.
In March, the administration issued final rules requiring 1.5% annual increases in vehicle fuel efficiency through 2026 - far weaker than the 5% increases set under former President Barack Obama. The Trump administration also abandoned its August 2018 proposal to freeze requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. 
California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said the administration ""used questionable science, faulty logic and ludicrous assumptions to justify what they wanted from the start: to gut and rewrite the single most important air regulation of the past decade.""
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the rule a ""gift to the fossil fuel industry"" that would harm the state, home to Detroit's Big Three automakers, because it would reduce automotive-related employment by 4%.
The Environmental Protection Agency declined comment on the suit but defended the rule as a ""sensible, single national program that strikes the right regulatory balance, protects our environment, and sets reasonable targets for the auto industry.""
New York City, Denver, San Francisco and Los Angeles are joining the challenge by California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada and 17 other states.
Separately, 12 environmental groups including the Environmental Defense Fund, Sierra Club and Union of Concerned Scientists also sued over the rules.
A trade group representing General Motors Co (N:GM), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and others said it would review the lawsuit. Last week, the group sided with the Trump administration plan and opposed a legal challenge to further weaken the requirements, while other automakers including Ford did not.
The new rules require the U.S. vehicle fleet to average 40.4 miles per gallon rather than 46.7 under the Obama rules finalized in 2012.
In 2019,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), Honda Motor Co (T:7267), BMW AG (DE:BMWG) and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) reached an agreement with California over compromise fuel efficiency rules more stringent than Trump's but weaker than Obama's.
The Trump administration said the new rules would reduce future new car costs and save automakers billions in regulatory costs but boost average consumer fuel costs, while lifting oil consumption by about 2 billion barrels and hiking carbon dioxide emissions by 867 to 923 million metric tons.

Obama's environmental policies sought to cut carbon emissions that drive climate change, while Trump has ditched numerous environmental regulations his administration deemed harmful to industry.

Tomorrow brings unemployment numbers and those on long-lasting goods. And there will be the latest on oil stockpiles.
Here are the three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. New Claims in a Plateau?
Economists expect more than 2 million more people applied for unemployment benefits last week.
The Labor Department issues the claims numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT) as usual.
The consensus forecast compiled by Investing.com of 2.1 million looks to be a pause for the market, even thoug the number is still incredibly high. But it’s also important to look at the level of continuing claims as the U.S. starts to reopen.
Those claims are expected to edge up to 25.75 million.
GDP numbers arrive at the same time, with the second measure of first-quarter growth expected to remain at a contraction of 4.8%. No surprise there.
2. Housing Data Arrive
Those familiar with domesticity will enjoy another duo of data tomorrow.
New home sales shocked everyone this week with a surprise gain and pending home sales for April arrive at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The number of homes under contract are expected to have dropped 15% last month, compared with a decline of more than 20%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Those homes will need appliances as well, so check out durable goods orders at 8:30 AM ET.
Orders for goods lasting three or more years are seen plunging 19% for April.
3. Oil Inventories on Tap
Oil prices continue to bounce and tomorrow brings the official U.S. petroleum inventory numbers at 10:30 PM ET (14:30 GMT).
On average, analysts expect that U.S. oil inventories fell by about 1.9 million barrels for the week ended May 22, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
After the bell today the American Petroleum Institute said its measure of weekly stockpiles jumped by 8.7 million barrels."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Wednesday it was eliminating more than 12,000 U.S. jobs, including 6,770 involuntary layoffs, as the largest American planemaker restructures in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.
Boeing also disclosed it plans ""several thousand remaining layoffs"" in coming months but did not say where those would take place.
Boeing is slashing costs as a sharp drop in airplane demand during the pandemic worsened a crisis for the company whose 737 MAX jet was grounded last year after a second fatal crash.
Boeing said it restarted 737 MAX production at a ""low rate"" at its Renton, Washington factory. Reuters reported in April that regulatory approval for the MAX was not expected until at least August.
Boeing shares closed up 3.3% at $149.52, then rose another 4.6% to $155.84 after hours on news of the MAX production restart.
The company announced in April it would cut 10% of its worldwide workforce of 160,000 by the end of 2020. Boeing said Wednesday 5,520 U.S. employees will take voluntary layoffs, and also disclosed it was notifying 6,770 workers of involuntary layoffs.
Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told employees in an email the ""pandemic's devastating impact on the airline industry means a deep cut in the number of commercial jets and services our customers will need over the next few years, which in turn means fewer jobs on our lines and in our offices. ... I wish there were some other way.""
CFRA analyst Colin Scarola upgraded Boeing to buy and raised his price target to $174 from $112 saying Boeing ""can weather its current crises and grow over the long term.""
In April, Boeing recorded zero orders for the second time this year and customers canceled another 108 orders for the 737 MAX, compounding its worst start to a year since 1962.
Last month, Boeing raised $25 billion in a bond offering that allowed it to avoid taking government aid.
The job cuts include more than 9,800 employees in Washington State. Boeing said the ""several thousand remaining layoffs will come in additional tranches over the next few months.""
Boeing said it expects to resume 737 MAX deliveries in the third quarter following regulatory approvals before gradually increasing to 31 per month during 2021.
The aerospace sector has been hard hit including many Boeing suppliers.

 General Electric  Co (N:GE) said this month it planned to cut its aviation unit's global workforce this year by as much as 25%, or up to 13,000 jobs. SpiritAero Systems Holdings (N:SPR) announced it is cutting another 1,450 jobs in Kansas.

However, shares rose 8.8% to $35.90 in extended trading after the company's quarterly results beat Wall Street expectations.
""Our second quarter was essentially bifurcated by the impact of Covid-19,"" Chief Executive Douglas Yearley said in a statement.
Economic data showed at least 21.4 million people lost their jobs in March and April due to the coronavirus outbreak, and home sales plunged in April despite record low mortgage rates. 
Pennsylvania-based Toll said the average home price fell about 12% to $788,500 from a year earlier, while the number of homes sold rose to 1,923 units from 1,911 units.
The company's net income fell to $75.7 million, or 59 cents per share, in the second quarter ended April 30, from $129.3 million, or 87 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Revenue fell 9.8% to $1.55 billion. 
Analysts on average had expected earnings of 45 cents per share and revenue of $1.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Larger rivals, D.R. Horton Inc (N:DHI),  Lennar  Corp (N:LEN) and PulteGroup (N:PHM) have also abandoned their full-year financial targets citing order cancellations.

(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) is reshuffling its management team to help the airline prepare for the near-term uncertainty of travel demand, new Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told employees on Wednesday, as restrictions to keep the coronavirus from spreading are lifted.
With stay-at-home orders easing across the United States, airlines have pointed to slight improvements in air travel demand that had virtually disappeared in April. Still, the outlook remains uncertain.
""Demand could be down 30% or it could be down 70%,"" Kirby said. 
Under the changes, Jon Roitman, currently United's senior vice president of airport and network operations, will replace Greg Hart as chief operations officer effective June 1.
Hart will be taking a step back to focus on medium- and long-term issues including innovation on safety, hygiene, and operating efficiency as airlines prepare for drastic changes in the travel industry following the coronavirus outbreak. 
Hart will also be tasked with developing a more nimble cost structure, including labor costs.
Chicago-based United came under fire when it tried to cut working hours for thousands of union aircraft and passenger service workers, a plan the union said violated the terms of government payroll aid under the CARES Act, which bans airlines from cutting jobs or pay rates through Sept. 30.
United rolled back the plan after the union filed a lawsuit, but is still cutting hours for 10,000 management and administrative employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

The company has said the move is in compliance with the CARES Act.

1131,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Alibaba Hunts for a Million Influencers Keen to Make Big Money,"(Bloomberg) --
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. pioneered the use of live-streaming hosts to sell everything from lipstick to smartphones in China. Now, the e-commerce giant wants to repeat that success globally with the help of a million influencers on forums from TikTok to Instagram.
AliExpress, the company’s online marketplace for shoppers outside China, is on the hunt for social media personalities to hawk wares on its online malls around the world. It’s looking to attract more than 100,000 content creators this year to its recently launched AliExpress Connect, rising to over a million in three years. The platform offers a matchmaking service, helping pair social media influencers with brands and merchants looking to market their products. Its initial focus is Europe, where Russia, France, Spain and Poland comprise the majority of users.
Alibaba hopes to replicate the success it’s enjoyed with so-called key opinion leaders driving sales on its China online marketplace Taobao. “For both Taobao and AliExpress, social content is a way to diversify offerings, but not to generate revenue,” Yuan Yuan, head of operations for AliExpress, told Bloomberg News. Influencers will help users stick with the platform instead of just making a one-time purchase. “The goal is to accumulate users, keep them there and encourage them to remain active.”
China’s largest e-commerce company currently gets just a fraction of its retail revenue from outside its home country, but it’s harbored bigger international ambitions for years. The move marks Alibaba’s latest global push and comes at a time when Covid-19 is fueling an unprecedented boom in social media. The company’s rivals, including TikTok proprietor ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent-backed  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc., are playing catch-up in live streaming and other means of social commerce championed by the Taobao Live app.
Global social giants like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). have also added new features that support online shopping. In the U.S., more than 75 million social-network users aged 14 or older are expected to make at least one online purchase this year, up over 17% from 2019, according to research firm eMarketer.
Influencers and content creators can sign up for Connect using TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and other social accounts. They can then solicit assignments from AliExpress merchants seeking help in promoting their goods or services. This gives the influencer options, from merely reposting the seller’s social media posts to creating original videos. Commission fees can be based on the sales the influencers generate.
AliExpress is one of two Alibaba online bazaars for international buyers, the other being the Southeast-Asia-focused Lazada. AliExpress merchants are mainly small, export-oriented businesses in China, but global brands like Samsung (KS:005930) and Oral-B have increasingly set up shop on the platform, targeting regional markets. Its top consumer markets include Russia, the U.S., Brazil and Spain.
Yuan said AliExpress aims to help at least 100 of its army of a million influencers earn an annual income of more than $1 million within three years. “Only if they can make money will they be motivated to create good content for our platform,” she said.

(Reuters) -  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) is not considering a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, Chief Executive Doug Parker said on Wednesday and dismissed speculation that a major U.S. carrier could disappear due to the coronavirus pandemic.
""Bankruptcy is failure. We're not going to do that,"" Parker told a conference, adding: ""I don't think you'll see any airline go by the wayside as a result of this crisis.""
Shares in American rose 5.5% in late trading.
The U.S. airline industry is expected to be 10% to 20% smaller in the summer of 2021, Parker said, and its recovery would depend on how passenger demand and revenues evolve.
Earlier this month,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told NBC he thought that a major U.S. carrier could go out of business in the fall, when government payroll aid for airlines will expire.
U.S. airlines, suffering an unprecedented downturn in air travel because of the pandemic, have warned they may need to eliminate jobs after Oct. 1 but Parker said the company aimed to avoid furloughs.
Nearly 40,000 of its more than 100,000 employees have opted for an early retirement, reduced work schedule or temporary leaves, he said.
American's revenues are down by about 90% due to the outbreak, but demand is improving and net receipts have been in positive territory for the past 2-1/2 weeks after a period when airlines were receiving more cancellations than new bookings.
""More and more people are feeling more comfortable today, but we need to get to a point where all Americans are as comfortable flying as they should be,"" he said.

American's planes were about 56% full over the long U.S. Memorial Day weekend, albeit in drastically reduced capacity, he said. American is flying about 20% of its normal schedule.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>","Ackman says hedge fund up 27% year to date, dumped Berkshire","BOSTON (Reuters) - William Ackman's hedge fund is boasting double-digit gains at a time many portfolios have sunk along with the economy during the coronavirus pandemic, after the billionaire investor plowed cash into a number of companies he already owned and dumped Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway among other stocks.
The public and private funds at Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management have gained between 22% and 27% this year, handily beating both the Standard & Poor's 500 index and the average hedge fund which are each off 7% since January, Ackman said.
Ackman, who began worrying about the health and market impact of the pandemic months ago, famously hedged his portfolio with a $27 million bet that turned into a $2.7 billion windfall that he reinvested in the stock market in late March, buying bigger stakes in companies he was already betting on.
""We like what we own and we still think these stocks are cheap,"" Ackman told investors on a conference call on Wednesday, adding that his portfolio contains companies whose businesses can withstand unpredictable events with severe consequences.
Positions in Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa), Blackstone Group (N:BX) and Park Hotels & Resorts (N:PK) were liquidated because the cash could be used more efficiently elsewhere, he said.
Money was used to buy more stock in Agilent Technologies (N:A), Starbucks (O:SBUX), Restaurant Brands International (TO:QSR), Lowe's Cos Inc (N:LOW) and  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (N:HLT), he said, arguing these large companies have best-in-class technology to weather the pandemic.
This year's gains come on the heels of last year's 58.1% return, the single best year since Pershing Square's founding in 2004, and signal that Ackman is still having success with his back-to-basics strategy where in 2018, he took back control of making investments instead of being the firm's chief marketer.
Ackman was early in closing down his Manhattan office and sending staff to work from home. When millions of other Americans were told to stay away from the office, Ackman pounced on the beaten-down stock of Lowe's, arguing that the time for long-delayed home improvement projects is now.

""We bought Lowe's at $84 a share and it was the bargain of a lifetime,"" he said with the stock now at $127.62.

Exxon shareholders on Wednesday rejected all four shareholder resolutions, with none getting more than 38% of the votes cast. The independent chairman proposal fell with 32.7% in favor of an appointment when the next chief executive is named. 
BlackRock, which this year joined the Climate 100+ investor group seeking greenhouse gas emissions curbs, said the current Exxon board lacked independent leadership and showed no ""sense of urgency"" with regard to climate-related risks. 
""Exxon may benefit from the addition of an individual with more direct industry experience on the board,"" BlackRock said. BlackRock is the company's second largest institutional owner with about 6.7% of Exxon shares outstanding. 
An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on the BlackRock votes, but pointed to CEO Darren Woods' remarks that Exxon recognizes the importance of addressing climate risks and has focused on developing technologies to address them. 
BlackRock said it also voted against Exxon directors Angela Braly, the former CEO of health insurer WellPoint (NYSE:ANTM), and Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of pharmaceutical maker Merck & Co, over Exxon's ""insufficient progress"" on climate-related financial disclosures and related action. Both directors were reelected. 

""We continue to see a gap in the company's disclosure and action with regard to several components of its climate risk management,"" BlackRock wrote of its votes.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 04:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chevron to cut up to 15% of staff amid restructuring,"By Shariq Khan and Jennifer Hiller
(Reuters) -  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) will cut 10% to 15% of its worldwide workforce as part of an ongoing restructuring at the second-largest U.S. oil producer.
The oil producer previously disclosed a 30% reduction in its 2020 spending and some voluntary job cuts amid this year's sharp drop in oil prices and lower demand for oil and gas due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Chevron has been widely seen as the standard bearer of financial discipline in the oil industry and was among the first to make significant budget cuts as oil demand plummeted. Last year, it abandoned a takeover bid for Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC) rather than get into a bidding war with Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY). Chevron pocketed a $1 billion break fee while Occidental has faced investor wrath for its ill-timed deal.
Chevron, which has 45,000 employees, expects to remove about 10% to 15% of its global staff to ""match projected activity levels,"" spokeswoman Veronica Flores-Paniagua confirmed. 
U.S. crude oil prices (CLc1) have nearly halved this year to about $33 a barrel as the COVID-19 pandemic slashed travel and led to stay-at-home orders that have cut oil demand by as much as 2 million barrels per day. Chevron this month said it would reduce planned U.S. shale output by about 125,000 bpd.
The about 4,500 to 6,750 job cuts envisioned are to ""address current market conditions,"" with varying impact on each business unit and region, said Flores-Paniagua. Most reductions will take place this year. ""This is a difficult decision and we do not take it lightly,"" she said. 
At its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, No. 1 U.S. oil producer  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) said it had not yet taken steps to reduce its workforce. ""Today, we have no layoff plans,"" Chief Executive Darren Woods said. Exxon also cut its planned spending 30% for the year.
Both companies have outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world's top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades.
Chevron's proposed job cuts match those at oilfield service companies and many smaller producers amid the price collapse. 
""Most companies are looking to cut 10% of staff at a minimum,"" said Jennifer Rowland, an energy analyst at Edward Jones. 
A next round of selections for outplacement will take place in June, according to a memo from Chevron Executive Vice President Joseph Geagea viewed by Reuters. Reorganization at his technology, products and services operation could be finished by the end of October, he wrote. 
Additional severance pay, a medical benefits subsidy and education services will be available to U.S. employees who lose their positions, he wrote. 
In March, Chevron began offering severance payments to some of its U.S. oil exploration and production employees. 

It last year launched a major cost-cutting overhaul that has already pared the number of units.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian food company BRF SA (SA:BRFS3) said the potential closure of slaughterhouses due the spread of the novel coronavirus at meat production sites would make it impossible to keep output at current levels.
There are no BRF plants closed due to the outbreak, but at one point, the company's Lajeado facility in Rio Grande do Sul state had been shut by authorities to contain the spread of the disease among workers.
""We have to be aware that if contagion worsens and authorities see the need to close units it is mathematically impossible to ensure production levels,"" Luz said.
BRF said this week nearly 340 meatpacking workers at a its Concórdia plant, which employs 5,132 people, had tested positive for the virus and would be submitted to further testing..
As the disease spreads, Luz said BRF will be hiring 5,000 new workers, up from 2,000 announced in April, to offset absentee meat plant employees and compensate for those unable to work amid the public health crisis. 
Rival JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) is also facing challenges, as it is being sued by labor prosecutors in two Brazilian states over alleged failure to adequately protect workers amid the pandemic.
At the same time, JBS is trying to reopen a plant in Santa Catarina state after a labor inspection found irregularities in measures to control the spread of the disease and a high number of employees who had tested positive for coronavirus.
On Wednesday, a labor court in the remote state of Rondonia ordered the closure of a plant operated there by JBS until the company tests all employees.

Most of the coronavirus outbreaks have occurred in Southern states like Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, where most of Brazil's pork and chicken processors are based.

(Reuters) - Shares of biotechs racing to make coronavirus vaccines, including  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA), fell about 10% on Wednesday, as investor concerns grew about the prospects of the experimental products that are still in early stages of development.
Moderna's stock has more than doubled this year, on the back of early positive data from its experimental vaccine, among the first to be tested in humans in the United States for the virus. 
Shares of the company fell as investors questioned the widely accepted timeline of 12 to 18 months for developing a vaccine for the new coronavirus, and also worried about a lack of granular data on the vaccines, analysts said. 
""The stock was due for a pullback on some concerns around timing of COVID-19 vaccine deployment,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh. 
The 12-18 months timeline was too aggressive,  Merck & Co  Inc (N:MRK) Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier told the Financial Times on Tuesday.
""We will certainly have doses (of coronavirus vaccines) by the end of the year, I just don't think we will have data to support widespread inoculation by then,"" Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said on CNBC. 
Moderna's shares tumbled over 16% on Tuesday after a report in medical news website Stat highlighted side effects in a volunteer taking part in a trial testing the company's vaccine.
Wall Street was also concerned about a lack of data on the experimental vaccines under development, said Roth Capital Partners analyst Yasmeen Rahimi.

Shares of other companies developing the vaccines such as Inovio (O:INO) and  Novavax  (O:NVAX) fell between 9% and 10% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, while Moderna was down 11%.

Home deliveries are surging as consumers around the globe shift to online shopping in the wake of store closures and physical distancing measures aimed at reducing the death toll from the coronavirus pandemic that has already killed at least 350,600 people. 
Petra Scharner-Wolff, the finance chief of Hermes, which is owned by e-commerce group Otto, earlier on Wednesday said the firm's effort to find a strategic partner for its European parcel service had garnered broad interest.
Citing unnamed sources close to the company, Handelsblatt said financial investor Advent was still in the running for a stake in the company in Britain.
Representatives from Otto and FedEx each declined comment. 
FedEx has a limited presence in the European consumer parcel delivery sector.
The Memphis-based company said last month it would tap debt markets to bolster reserves as the novel coronavirus hammers its higher-profit business-to-business shipments, while driving up demand for low-margin home deliveries. 
While a tie-up with Hermes could create some efficiencies, experts said the deal is not without risks. FedEx is still grappling with its 2016 acquisition of European operator TNT Express (NYSE:EXPR), which specializes in shipments between businesses. 
""It makes a lot of sense, because they need it ... The risk is they haven't been very successful with the integration of TNT,"" said Mare Różycki, managing partner at Last Mile Experts, a European delivery consultancy. 
Hermes has seen parcel volumes soar in Germany and Britain in April to levels usually seen in the pre-Christmas rush, Otto said on Wednesday. 

The company recorded a double-digit loss in 2019, when it also struggled with a shortage of drivers, according to Handelsblatt.

1149,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>","Occidental is sued by shareholders, bondholders over Anadarko merger","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) has been sued by investors who claim they suffered billions of dollars of losses because the heavily indebted company concealed its inability to weather plunging oil prices, after paying $35.7 billion to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
The proposed securities class action was filed late Tuesday in a New York state court in Manhattan on behalf of former Anadarko shareholders who swapped their stock for Occidental shares, and investors who acquired $24.5 billion of Occidental bonds that helped fund the August 2019 merger.
Investors said Occidental should have disclosed in its stock and bond registration statements how quadrupling its debt load to $40 billion would leave it ""precariously exposed"" to falling oil prices, and undermine its ability to boost shale oil production and its common stock dividend.
The investors also said Houston-based Occidental's issuance of $10 billion of preferred stock to Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) compounded the overleveraging. 
As of Tuesday, Occidental's market value had dropped to $13 billion from about $44 billion when the merger closed. Some of Occidental's new bonds traded at between 60 and 90.5 cents on the dollar.
""Investors have suffered severe losses,"" the complaint said.
Occidental spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb declined to comment.
Other defendants include Chief Executive Vicki Hollub, former Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher and several Occidental directors.
Bank of America (N:BAC),  Citigroup  (N:C), JPMorgan (N:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC), which helped underwrite Occidental's bonds, were also sued for alleged inadequate due diligence.
Occidental has since early March slashed capital spending and salaries and lowered its dividend 86%, as reduced travel stemming from the coronavirus pandemic as well as a price war caused oil prices to tumble.
The company lost $2.23 billion in the first quarter, and Hollub said Occidental may sell assets to raise money. She recently survived a proxy battle with activist investor Carl Icahn.

The case is City of Sterling Heights General Employees' Retirement System et al v Occidental Petroleum Corp et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County.

In a statement on Wednesday, the company said Norsa had been appointed to the board as executive deputy chairman as part of plans to change governance at the fashion house.
Under the new structure, the group's majority shareholder, family holding Ferragamo Finanziaria, will focus on strategic planning, while the running of the company will be left entirely to executive managers.
The company said Ferruccio Ferragamo would keep his position as chairman but that Norsa would take over his executive powers.
Norsa was chief executive at Ferragamo for around 10 years before leaving in 2016. He later joined rival fashion firm Missoni at the behest of state-backed investment company FSI.
After his departure, Ferragamo set about reorganising its business to sustain sales but went through a period of turbulence, changing managers several times.
Norsa will start in his new role on May 28 and will work closely with the group's CEO Micaela le Divelec Lemmi, the company said.

The luxury industry worldwide is facing a major sales hit due to the health emergency which first emerged in China, home to more than a third of global luxury shoppers.

The judge sided with the Canadian prosecutors in ruling that the legal standard of double criminality had been met, meaning the U.S. charges against Meng are also crimes in Canada.
The United States has charged Meng with bank fraud and misleading HSBC (L:HSBA) about a Huawei-owned company's dealings with Iran - was also illegal in Canada at the time of her December 2018 arrest.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa's (DE:LHAG) $10 billion government bailout was thrown into doubt on Wednesday after the German airline's supervisory board refused to accept the conditions attached by Brussels. 
The board, which had been expected to sign off on the aid, instead refused EU requirements that Lufthansa permanently give up take-off and landing slots at Frankfurt and Munich airports, where it commands a two-thirds market share.
The bailout plan nevertheless remains ""the only viable alternative"" to insolvency, Lufthansa said, and negotiations will continue over EU demands that would ""lead to a weakening"" of its airport hubs as well as its ability to repay loans.
The European Commission had ""no comment on the specific case"", a spokesperson said.
Terms discussed with Brussels included the forfeiture of 72 slots used by 12 of 300 jets based at the two airports, a source familiar with the matter said. But whereas Lufthansa wanted to reclaim the slots after repaying aid, the Commission sought permanent concessions, the person said.
Airlines including Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and the main U.S. carriers have all sought government aid to ride out the coronavirus crisis, which has brought air travel to a near-halt.
The bailout deal announced on Monday would see the German government take a 20% stake in Lufthansa in return for a 6 billion euro injection of new capital, most of it non-voting, combined with 3 billion in state-backed loans.
The Lufthansa group employs around 138,000 people, according to its website. 
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said after the board announcement he still expected Brussels to approve the package.
""It's not only in Germany's interests but also in the European Union's interests to avoid a sell-off of strategic interests in the industrial sector as a result of this pandemic,"" Altmaier added.
Some rival airlines disagree.
Low-cost carrier Ryanair's (I:RYA) Chief Executive Michael O'Leary vowed on Tuesday to challenge a bailout package he said would ""massively distort competition"" in the German market for the next five years.
""It is deeply ironic that the German government, which lectures all other EU countries about respecting EU rules, has no difficulty breaking the State Aid rules when it comes to Lufthansa,"" O'Leary said in a Ryanair statement.

But the German Cockpit Association, a pilots' union, also warned that giving up slots to budget rivals would threaten European jobs and labour standards.
""Some airlines in the low-cost segment have large financial reserves because they have disregarded the rights of employees for years and ... passed on their business risk to their employees,"" the group said.
""It cannot be the goal of German and European rescue policy to save companies from insolvency with billions in cash and at the same time put them at a severe disadvantage.""

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 edged higher in choppy trading on Wednesday as optimism over a pick up in business activity helped offset worries over simmering U.S.-China tensions, although gains were capped by losses in technology stocks.
Bank stocks (SPSY), which typically track improvements in the economic outlook, provided the biggest boost to the benchmark index, sending it past the psychologically important mark of 3,000 points in intraday trading for the second day.
In contrast, heavyweights Amazon.com (O:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), which have led a recent rally, were down between 1% and 2%, while healthcare (SPXHC) and technology (SPLRCT) - outperformers in the coronavirus-led market slump - were among the S&P 500 sectors in the red.
""The managers that have missed this rally off the bottom are desperately panicking to find value and now they are starting to do it with banks,"" said Thomas Hayes, managing member at Great Hill Capital LLC in New York.
""In the last couple of days, the reopening and the recovery have started to feel real for people and that goes a long way for confidence, both at the consumer level and in market sentiment as well.""
The easing of lockdowns, optimism about an eventual COVID-19 vaccine and massive U.S. stimulus have powered a recent stock market rally, helping the S&P 500 (SPX) end on Tuesday at its highest level since early March.
However, Sino-U.S. worries have kept a lid on further gains. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Washington would announce its response to China's planned national security legislation on Hong Kong before the end of the week.
At 12:52 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 273.62 points, or 1.09%, at 25,268.73 and the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 13.02 points, or 0.44%, at 3,004.79.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was down 41.69 points, or 0.45%, at 9,298.53.
Facebook Inc (O:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) slipped 2% and 3.3%, respectively, as Trump threatened to shutter social media companies a day after Twitter prompted readers to fact check some of his tweets.
Investor attention will now turn to the U.S. Federal Reserve's Beige Book of economic condition scheduled for release at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT).
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.09-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.34-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P index recorded four new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 30 new highs and seven new lows.

Now, more than two months after President Trump declared a state of national emergency, some hard-hit U.S. sectors are showing signs of warming back up (fashion, jewelry and real-estate), and the growing popularity of other sectors (website-building) suggest the acceptance, at least in the medium term, of a new normal.

The U.S. auto industry reopened many plants last week after a two-month shutdown due to the global pandemic. To ensure safety during the outbreak, companies imposed new safety measures, including screening employees, use of face masks and social distancing.
Ford paused production at its Claycomo, Missouri, plant for an hour on Tuesday after a worker tested positive. Work resumed at the plant, which builds the F-150 pickup truck and Transit van, without workers being sent home following a deep cleaning, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said Wednesday. 
General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) said Wednesday they have had workers test positive since the restart, but have not been forced to idle plants. They did not disclose the number of workers affected. 
On Wednesday, a union leader at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant said on Twitter a worker there tested positive, but had not worked since May 21. Felker said the plant never closed.
Last week, Ford closed two assembly plants, due to a positive test at its Dearborn, Michigan, factory and a parts shortage due to a positive test at a supplier that closed the Chicago plant. It had marked the second consecutive day for closures in Chicago following two positive tests. 
United Auto Workers Local 600, which represents hourly workers in Dearborn, last week demanded testing for every worker there and that Ford shut down the plant for 24 hours after a positive test. Ford said the safety of its workers is a top priority and cited the safety measures it has developed in conjunction with the UAW.

In Mexico, Ford told workers it was targeting a May 28 restart at its Hermosillo plant. GM and FCA have restarted operations in Mexico.

(Reuters) - Hedge fund Starboard Value LP is close to having eight directors elected to the board of  GCP Applied Technologies Inc  (N:GCP) at the chemical company's annual meeting, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
While not all votes have been cast before Thursday's annual meeting and the result could change, preliminary figures indicate Starboard will see its entire slate elected by GCP shareholders, the sources said.
The sources asked not to be identified before an official announcement. GCP and Starboard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Bloomberg reported the expected outcome first on Wednesday.
The vote will likely give Starboard control of the board and marks the first time one of the activist investor's proxy contests has ended in a vote since it made corporate governance history by unseating all 12 directors at Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) in 2014.
GCP and Starboard, which owns 9% of the company, have been locked in an increasingly bitter proxy battle since early April when the hedge fund nominated eight candidates, including Peter Feld, Starboard's director of research, to the board.
GCP currently has nine board members and will expand the size to 10 at the annual meeting on Thursday. GCP ran a slate of 10 director candidates.
Starboard won significant support for its campaign when Standard Industries, Inc and its affiliated entity 40 North Management LLC, which together own 24.4% of GCP's stock, backed the activist hedge fund.
With Starboard and 40 North controling nearly one third of the vote, it was a tough battle for the company to win.

The coronavirus outbreak is hitting the young “harder and faster than any other group,” with a risk of scarring them for their working lives, according to the International Labour Organization.
More than than one in six people have stopped working since the onset of the crisis, highlighting the predicament of a cohort often subject to informal contracts, low pay and disproportionately likely to work in sectors like retail that have been shut down by the outbreak.
“The pandemic is inflicting a triple shock on young people,” the ILO said in a report on Wednesday. “Not only is it destroying their employment, but it is also disrupting education and training, and placing major obstacles in the way of those seeking to enter the labor market or to move between jobs.”
In the U.S. alone, the unemployment rate for young men aged 16–24 surged from 8.5% to 24% between February and April, while for young women it jumped from 7.5% to 29.8%. Similar trends were visible in Canada, China, Australia, and other countries, the ILO said.
Young people entering the labor market during a recession can suffer the fallout for years because they struggle to find a job or have to take one that doesn’t match their educational background.
“Long-lasting wage losses are likely to be experienced by entire cohorts of young people who have the misfortune of graduating from secondary school or university during the 2019/20 academic year,” the report found.
The ILO’s warning stands in contrast to comments made by European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who at an on-line event for young people on Wednesday encouraged viewers to embrace change, acquire new skills and be “prepared to do all sorts of jobs.”

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial services sector should be ready for a no-deal Brexit when a transition period with Brussels expires in December, a senior European Union official said on Wednesday.
Britain left the EU in January, but firms still have unfettered access to the bloc until the end of the year.
Paulina Dejmek-Hack, director of the European Commission's task force for relations with Britain, said EU assessments on whether UK financial rules were ""equivalent"" to those in the bloc - which could allow some direct market access to continue from January - were ongoing.
Equivalence can be granted to ""third countries"", or non-EU states, in a limited range of activities like clearing derivatives and trading shares. It excludes basic banking, which has forced lenders in Britain to open subsidiaries in the bloc.
Dejmek-Hack said that ""under all circumstances"" the reality for financial firms in Britain from next January would be very different from today, regardless of possibilities of equivalence.
""A lot of preparations went into no-deal and it's important that these kinds of preparations are taken up again,"" she told a webinar held by IIF, a global banking lobby.
Over the longer term, the EU would weigh equivalence based access with the need to develop its own banking and capital markets, she said.
""Today we have a financial sector in Europe which is extremely dependent on London ... but of course, long term we need reflection on what kind of dependence one would want to have on a third country,"" Dejmek-Hack said.
Martine Doyon, head of government affairs for Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) bank in Europe, said financial rules in Britain and the EU were fully aligned, but a mechanism was needed for dealing with potential divergence over time.

Dejmek-Hack said potential divergence in coming years needed to be looked at, adding equivalence could be withdrawn by Brussels if rules were no longer similar enough.

Online sales in China, a crucial growth market for luxury goods companies, jumped 76% in the fourth quarter. 
The New York-based company said it expanded the number of stores that could fulfill online orders in the country during the pandemic and rolled out digital services like advising big-spending clients on style and events. 
Ralph Lauren, which is now testing these services in North America as well as Europe, said sales growth in China could return to pre-health crisis levels by its second quarter as most of its stores there are now open.
""We ultimately have an opportunity to gain market share as we emerge from this crisis,"" Chief Executive Officer Patrice Louvet said.
Ralph Lauren said loungewear and athleisure products were in strong demand as people spend more time at home. The company also said Spring collections stocked in warehouses could still be sold later in the year.
However, as a deep recession looms, Ralph Lauren said it continues to expect significant pain in fiscal 2021.
In the fourth quarter, net revenue fell 15.4% to $1.27 billion, but was slightly above analysts' average estimate of $1.22 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Excluding certain items, it lost 68 cents per share, while analysts were expecting a loss of 40 cents.
The company's shares were up about 2% in morning trading.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's car dealers - used to selling at sky-high prices due to steep taxes - are getting a boost from the gap between official and informal values of the country's peso, which is halving the sticker price for buyers with dollars.
It works like this: A Ford Ka's list price, for example, is 822,870 pesos, or around $12,100 using an official rate around 68 pesos per dollar. However, via unofficial channels buyers can get 112 pesos per dollar, bringing the price closer to $7,000.
That is more in line with what the price should be, said Willie Dietrich whose Dietrich Group dealership sells Ford and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) brands, suggesting a silver lining for at least some firms hit by the coronavirus and a nationwide lockdown.
""People today are interested in the price of cars because they have the real price. The market is wise,"" said Dietrich. Taxes represent around 55% of the retail cost of cars in Argentina, with an extra amount normally levied against ""high-end"" vehicles, Dietrich said.
His networks of dealerships has been operating at limited capacity since the lockdown began in March, but he said there had been more activity than expected.
""We've had many people coming in to make enquiries. And in the two days we opened, we had perhaps seven to eight people in each branch. In a time of economic uncertainty and a pandemic, that's a lot,"" he said.
Argentina's peso is being held artificially high by strict currency controls, even as fears over the economy and demand for dollars drives unofficial rates to record lows. The country faces a deepening recession and is locked in negotiations with creditors to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt.
Ricardo Salomé, president of the Argentine Association of Automotive Dealers, told Reuters some high-end cars were getting help from the peso gap.
""There are models that have already disappeared from the market because they've been sold out. They were worth $60,000 or $70,000 and today are available at half the price,"" he said.
It is cold comfort for most dealers, however. Argentina's retail auto sales to consumers plunged 83.3% in April versus a year earlier and production is down to zero.
The peso's large gap to unofficial rates also leaves it in danger of sharp depreciation and the government has been tightening loopholes to buy dollars.
Salomé said Argentina's auto sales for the year were likely to be around 220,000 units, less than half of 2019 when 460,000 cars were sold.

""This (trend) alone is not enough to cover the fundamental costs of the dealers. We have human resources for a market of 750,000 units. Now we have an idle capacity of 70%.""

The company, the maker of Ice Breakers and Kisses, said its second-quarter performance would also be impacted due to a decline in its food service business and stunted candy sales at airports and stores.

Hershey has for long been betting on its nutritious and on-the-go snack portfolio, a hit with health-conscious consumers who would pick up protein bars before heading to work.

LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis is accelerating a move to a new type of office which will be more of a ""mothership"" model with people working from multiple locations, though it is too early to write off mega cities such as London yet, Canary Wharf said.
As well as causing more than 350,000 deaths, the novel coronavirus outbreak has stalled the global economy and turned business models upside down in everything from the media and advertising to airlines, hospitality and commercial property.
Financiers trade trillions of dollars a day from the gleaming Manhattan-style skyscrapers of Canary Wharf, which along with the City of London, vies with New York for the title of the world's financial capital.
The district, built on derelict docks that once served the British empire, has plans to bring back up to half of the 125,000 people who usually work in the area while adhering to government advice on tackling the coronavirus.
But the office of the future may change, Howard Dawber, managing director of strategy at Canary Wharf, told Reuters.
""I think in the future you will see the office much more as the sort of mothership of the business with people working from multiple locations elsewhere, possibly business locations, possibly home,"" Dawber said. 
There will still be ""a core that provides a really great environment for that point where everybody has to be together. So I think we will see some long-term changes, but it's really things that are already happening that have been accelerated.""
Dawber said, though, that talk about the end of mega cities such as London was premature, despite the short-term changes in behaviour due to the coronavirus.
The modern Canary Wharf was built in the 1980s and 1990s in East London, on the ruins of what was once the world's largest port which processed the imports of an empire including bananas from the Canary Islands.
Soaring above some of London's poorest social housing blocks, Canary Wharf now serves as a symbol of Britain's only remaining non-military card of substance at the top table of world politics: its dominance of global financial services. 
CITADEL OF FINANCE
London is by far the world's biggest hub for foreign exchange trading, home to more international banks than any other city, and the largest centre for trading interest rate swaps.
Canary Wharf is owned by Brookfield Property Partners (NASDAQ:BPY), a unit of Toronto-based Brookfield Asset Management, and Qatar Investment Authority, Qatar's sovereign wealth fund.
Don't write off London, founded as Londinium by the Romans in AD 50, just yet, Dawber said.
""For the last 500 years the human race has been moving towards closer, denser city living,"" he said. ""Already half the world's population live in cities - three quarters by 2050 - and there are all sorts of good reasons to be in cities.""
By the time William Shakespeare died in 1616, the population of London was probably just over 200,000. By the outbreak of World War Two in 1939, it was 8.6 million. In 2015, it surpassed that peak and is projected to rise to 10.2 million by 2039. 
""We believe that we're now what the government calls 'COVID secure' and we can cope with relatively large numbers of people keeping two metres apart,"" Dawber said.

He said, though, that transport was a potential problem: ""Clearly, the whole of London isn't going to work unless the Tube is working at full capacity.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock  markets opened mostly higher again on Wednesday, with cyclicals and old-economy stocks leading the charge, recovering some of their underperformance vis-a-vis tech stocks and defensives over the last couple of months. 
By 9:37 AM ET (1337 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 340 points or 1.4% at 25,335 points, while the S&P 500 was up 0.8%, while the extent of the rotation out of tech stocks was illustrated by the Nasdaq Composite falling 0.2%.
Some of the biggest gainers were old-economy industrials and banks, the latter in particular having been spooked recently by fears that the Federal Reserve will resort to sub-zero interest rates next year. The notion of a quick and robust rebound, already strengthened by TV footage of a Memorial Day weekend where 'animal spirits' appeared generally unleashed, received further support from a clear rebound in the Richmond Federal Reserve's monthly business survey: the manufacturing index rebounded to -27 from -53, while the services index recovered to -48 from -87.
The Dallas Fed's monthly survey is due later, as is the Fed's Beige Book roundup.
JPMorgan  (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock both rebounded 3.8%, while  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) stock rose 6.3%, as participants took a slightly less bearish view on the outlook for its troubled aviation unit.
At the other end of the table, money flooded out of those stocks which had seemed the best refuge during the worst of the pandemic's effects. Amazon.com  (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock fell 2.2%, while Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) fell 6.0%. Shopify  (NYSE:SHOP) stock and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock both fell 7.4%. 
Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock also fell sharply for a second day after another filing showing that the biotech company's insiders sold stock in the wake of the company's $1.3 billion capital increase last week. The company has drawn criticism for issuing partial test results for its experimental Covid-19 antiviral drug, which propelled the stock to an all-time high just before the share sale. The stock 11.6% and is now down nearly one-third from the placement price.
In other markets, U.S. Crude Oil futures cooled off after their recent rally ahead of American Petroleum Institute inventory data at 4:30 PM ET. WTI was down 2.7% at $33.43 a barrel. Gold Futures, meanwhile, fell 0.5% to a three-week low while the US Dollar Index Futures was roughly unchanged."

1189,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",Renault and Nissan rule out merger as they unveil survival plan,"By Gilles Guillaume and Naomi Tajitsu
PARIS/TOKYO (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) ruled out a merger on Wednesday and doubled down on a plan to cooperate more closely on car production to save costs and salvage their troubled alliance.
The companies have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic just as they were trying to rework their partnership following the arrest of its chief architect, Carlos Ghosn, who had been pushing for a merger despite stiff resistance from Nissan.
The new plan, which entails cutting the alliance's vehicle ranges by a fifth, pooling manufacturing by region and capitalising on joint designs, is meant to serve as a peace treaty, sources have told Reuters.
""We don't need a merger to be efficient,"" Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard told a joint news conference. 
He also said existing ties with Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), which owns Mercedes-Benz, could be strengthened and that he hoped to make an announcement in the coming weeks.
Renault and Nissan were among the weakest global automakers going into the coronavirus crisis and had lacked a clear plan for using their alliance to emerge from the slump and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles and other technology. 
Rivals such as  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA), have been pushing ahead with plans to share costs and designs while the two biggest carmakers, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota (T:7203), already operate as single units.
Renault shares, which have been depressed by the tensions with Nissan and the French carmaker's first loss in a decade in 2019, surged by almost 20% following Wednesday's announcements.
Daimler shares jumped as much as 10% while Nissan closed 5.5% higher.
Renault is also on course to receive 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion)in French state aid although the government wants it to keep car manufacturing in France in return.

LEADER-FOLLOWER
Under their new plan, the alliance aims to make savings by sharing production in a so-called leader-follower system, with one company leading for a certain type of vehicle and geography with the others piggy-backing on the designs and manufacturing. 
Senard said that would help cut costs, with joint savings on future compact sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) coming to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion).
In Brazil, for example, the new approach means the alliance will go from making six models on four platforms - or underlying vehicle architectures - to seven models on one platform.
A tighter design and development process at the alliance, whose best-known cars include the Renault Clio compact hatchback, the Nissan Rogue crossover SUV and the Mitsubishi Outlander SUV, would reduce it total number of models by 20% by 2025 from well over 80 now.
Some analysts pointed to potential problems, however, saying the three companies remained locked in a partnership while some larger rivals were not constrained by structural limitations.
""The way this plan has been designed is to avoid stepping on each others' toes, but there could be some efficiency losses, as there are boundaries they have to respect,"" said Chris Richter, senior research analyst at brokerage CLSA.
Renault, Nissan and junior partner Mitsubishi, which joined the alliance in 2016, have clashed previously due to differences in corporate cultures and opposing views over structures.
Renault owns 43% of Nissan while it has 15% of the French carmaker but no voting rights. Nissan has resisted proposals for a full-blown merger as executives felt Renault was not paying its fair share for the engineering work it did in Japan. 
REGIONAL CARVE-UP
The strategy is a departure from Ghosn's focus on growth and volumes that led to excess capacity. Renault and Nissan, which is set to post a net loss in its latest fiscal year, are now hoping to get ahead of rivals in areas like electric vehicles.
They said they aimed to produce nearly half of their vehicles under the leader-follower approach by 2025 and cut investment for those models by up to 40%. 
Nissan will take the lead in Japan, China and North America, Renault will be the reference for Europe, Russia, South America and North Africa while Mitsubishi will lead in Southeast Asia and Oceania, the companies said. 
They did not detail how many jobs would go as production shifts, raising fears that some plants, including Nissan's Barcelona factory in Spain could shut. [L8N2CW57D] 
Nissan and Renault are due to announce separate restructuring plans on Thursday and Friday respectively. 
The alliance's new production plans will also include using more common parts and designs than before. They will now use a shared design for the upper body of each company's cars, which would then be personalised to reflect the individual brands.

""Today we have a much higher scope of sharing between the brands,"" said Alliance General Secretary Hadi Zablit.

London's High Court ruled earlier this month that the article did not imply that the financing group had knowingly provided a false statement to market investors over bonds it had issued in 2017.
On Tuesday, Greensill said in a statement it had ""chosen to  withdraw our claim and concentrate on the important role we can play in assisting our clients at this challenging time globally.""
It said that the judge at the preliminary trial concluded that ""the Reuters' article should not, and cannot, be taken to  mean that we are guilty, or even suspected, of having knowingly issued a false statement or committed market abuse."" 
Reuters said it was pleased by the outcome.
""The judge upheld the meaning of the Reuters article as published -- that Greensill provided a false statement to the bond market,"" a Reuters spokeswoman said. ""Our reporting was fair and accurate, and we stand by it.""

1191,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>","Without tourists, Europe's luxury shops struggle to reopen in style","By Silvia Aloisi
MILAN (Reuters) - As European luxury shopping capitals from Paris to Milan slowly emerge from coronavirus lockdowns, stores are reopening to a trickle of customers, and virtually no tourists.
The absence of big-spending travellers, particularly from China, the Middle East and the United States, is a major drag on sales as, depending on the brand, they provide between 35% and 55% of revenues in Europe. 
With a global recession looming, and fears of a second wave of infections, there seems little prospect of a big influx of tourists soon - or of local buyers making up the shortfall. 
In Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, the city's famed shopping arcade, masked sales clerks stood idly in empty Prada (OTC:PRDSY), Chanel and Louis Vuitton stores on Monday, a week after non-essential stores were allowed to reopen. Six of the eight restaurants lining the 19th century mall had opted to stay shut.
""It's quiet. I think it will be like this for weeks to come - hopefully not months,"" said a shop assistant at the Gucci stand in the upscale Rinascente department store.
Renato Borghi, head of fashion trade at Italian business lobby Confcommercio, said a straw poll of around 100 retailers in Milan showed an average 30% year-on-year drop in sales in the first week since shops there reopened on May 18.
But he added that for luxury stores in the city centre things were likely to have been worse since they rely so much on tourists and also because many locals are still working from home. 
A shop assistant at a high-end shoe store, which he asked not to identify because he is not allowed to disclose sales data, said that on Saturday he sold four pair of shoes compared to 10 in normal times. A store manager at a jeweller in Rome said first-week sales were down almost 70% on the year before.
Business appeared brisker in Paris, where stores have been open for just over two weeks. On Monday afternoon, 17 people queued outside the flagship Louis Vuitton store on the Champs Elysees, with white floor markings to keep them spaced out. 
Louis Vuitton's owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) did not reply to a request for comment on how sales had gone since the reopening. 
Rival  Kering  (PA:PRTP), which owns Gucci, said initial signs in France were encouraging. ""Traffic in stores has been higher than we expected and more customers are buying,"" it said.
Q2 CARNAGE
The generally cautious mood in Europe is in contrast with the pent-up demand for luxury goods in China and South Korea, where stores began reopening in March. There, labels including Hermes (PA:HRMS), Louis Vuitton and Dior have reported double-digit sales growth, even amid price hikes by some brands.
Despite that, consultancy Bain expects global sales of high-end clothing, handbags, jewellery and cosmetics to fall between 50% and 60% in the second quarter.
Brands are adopting different strategies. Some, like Chanel and Louis Vuitton, have raised prices to protect margins. 
Others, like Ferragamo (MI:SFER) and  Burberry  (L:BRBY), have written down the value of stock they will no longer sell at full price. 
Gucci's star designer Alessandro Michele, announcing this week he will move to just two, seasonless, fashion shows a year from five, said he wanted garments to stay in shops for longer. 
Luca Solca, a luxury goods analyst at Bernstein, expects the ""mother of all end-of-season's sales"" to offload excess stock.
In a sign shoppers are becoming more cautious as economies falter, the European Commission forecasts savings will reach 19% of households' income in the euro area this year - the highest since the start of the monetary union - from 13% in 2019.
With stores in London, another major European shopping hub, not due to reopen until June 15, ""40-50% of (luxury) sales have vanished in Europe and they won't come back for a while,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Flavio Cereda. 

""Young people and the middle class - the engines of growth for the sector - have less money to spend. The core wealthy customers are coming back, but that's not enough.""

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - World shares surged on Wednesday as reports of a European Union rescue fund helped offset concerns about unrest in Hong Kong over Beijing's proposed national security laws.
The European Commission proposed a package worth in total 1.85 trillion euros for the EU's next long-term budget and a recovery fund for economies hammered by the coronavirus pandemic.
News of the plan helped underpin a broad market rally in Europe. 
The euro (EUR=) jumped to trade at 1.1022 against the dollar, up from 1.0932, while the STOXX 600 (STOXX) extended gains, rising 0.7% to reach its highest level since March 10. Yields of Italian, Spanish and Portuguese sovereign debt fell to multi-week lows.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s index of the world's 49 stock markets (MIWD00000PUS) gained 0.3%, close to the two-and-a-half-month highs reached on Tuesday on hopes of economic recovery in the developed world as countries ease social restrictions after the COVID-19 crisis. 
But concerns about U.S.-China tensions over Hong Kong helped keep a dampener on stronger gains.
Riot police fired pepper pellets on protesters in Hong Kong's main business district, rekindling concern about the unrest seen last year that hit the territory's economy.
MSCI's ex-Japan Asia-Pacific index (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 0.4% as Hong Kong and mainland China shares extended declines.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) fell 1.0% and mainland shares (CSI300) were down 0.8%, amid fears the protests would worsen antagonism between the United States and China.
Oil prices fell amid the U.S.-China friction and concern over how quickly fuel demand will recover as lockdowns ease. Brent crude (LCOc1) futures dropped 1.6% to $35.60. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (CLc1) were down 1.2%, at $33.95 a barrel. [O/R]
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) rose 1.2% to their highest point since March 6. The index had cleared 3,000 points in Wall Street overnight before earlier pulling back, as some traders returned to the New York Stock Exchange floor for the first time in two months.
But China remained in focus after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he was preparing to take action against Beijing this week over its effort to impose national security laws on Hong Kong.
Worsening relations between the world's two biggest economies could further hobble global business activity, which is already under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.
The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, edged down 0.2% to 98.788 (=USD).
The Chinese yuan weakened to the lowest levels since early September in both onshore and offshore trade. The onshore renminbi slipped 0.3 to as low as 7.1595 per dollar ; the offshore currency fell 0.4% to 7.1760 per dollar .
Anticipation of the EU recovery plan lifted Southern European bonds.
Italy's 10-year bond yield fell to a seven-week low at 1.48% (IT10YT=RR), while Spain and Portugal's 10-year govt bond yields (ES10YT=RR), (PT10YT=RR) fell to eight-week lows. 
U.S. Treasury yields rose, with 10-year yields (US10YT=RR) at 0.687%, up about 4 basis points from Tuesday.

Gold prices  dropped to a two-week low, before paring some losses to trade down 0.1% to $1,79.00 per ounce. [GOL/]

1193,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Carlyle's Africa dealmakers leave to start their own buyout firm,"By Chibuike Oguh
(Reuters) - Four dealmakers responsible for  Carlyle Group  Inc's (O:CG) Sub-Saharan Africa Fund are leaving to launch their own firm, Carlyle said on Wednesday, in the latest private equity retreat from the continent.
Carlyle will remain active in Africa with its other funds, including Carlyle International Energy Partners.
But the Washington, D.C.-based firm said it would no longer pursue an Africa-dedicated buyout fund to succeed its $700 million Carlyle Sub-Saharan Africa Fund, which it raised in 2014.
This makes Carlyle the latest private equity giant to reduce its Africa exposure and underscores the challenges of dealmaking for Western private equity firms used to large leveraged buyouts of mature companies that can be saddled with debt.
Deals in the region tend to be smaller, the companies younger and thirsty for capital, and opportunities to cash out fewer, often fraught with political and economic risk.
Carlyle said Genevieve Sangudi, Eric Kump, Idris Mohammed and Bruce Steen were leaving to set up a new venture dubbed Alterra Capital.
Carlyle said it will have no stake in Alterra, but will provide deal referrals, advice and co-investment.
Carlyle's deals in Africa have included a $147 million bet on Nigeria's Diamond's Bank, which soured after a shrinking economy, a plunging currency and an oil price slump fueled a spate of defaults. Access Bank, another Nigerian bank, took over Diamond Bank last year.
Carlyle also bought into J&J Transport and Traxys between 2013 and 2014. J&J is an African transport firm with mining customers, while Traxys trades commodities in Africa and provides logistics.
In 2017, peer KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) disbanded its Africa deals team and sold off its controlling stake in an Ethiopian rose farm. That same year, Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) sold its stake in Black Rhino Group, an African infrastructure development firm, back to its management.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Why U.S. energy CEOs will get big payouts despite oil meltdown,"By Tim McLaughlin and David French
BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - National Oilwell Varco Inc (NYSE:NOV) has had a rough few years: Since 2017, the Houston company, whose drilling equipment is in major oilfields worldwide, has lost two-thirds of its value, costing shareholders a combined $9 billion.
Despite that performance, Chief Executive Clay Williams (NYSE:WMB) pocketed $3.3 million in stock in late February, solely because his company's total shareholder return over the three years ending in 2019 was not as bad as most of his beleaguered peers.
U.S. energy executives have retained such lavish payouts even as they have struggled for years to deliver shareholder returns - despite massive growth in domestic shale oil production.
Now executives' compensation is being insulated from the pain of the worst energy crisis in four decades, caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Stay-at-home orders to fight the virus have crushed demand for fossil fuels worldwide, forcing companies to cut thousands of jobs, slash billions in capital spending and, in some cases, fight for survival. On Thursday, NOV suspended its dividend to conserve cash.
Company spokesman Blake McCarthy said NOV has recently worked to make executive pay terms more ""shareholder friendly,"" including a new cap on payouts for negative returns, which the company disclosed in an April filing.
Williams and his peers, however, are in line for another round of big payouts. CEOs at energy companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index are sitting on $140 million in performance-based share grants made in 2019 that are scheduled to vest in 2021 and 2022, according to a Reuters review of their latest pay disclosures. 
The reason? Energy companies, more than any other sector, measure performance only against other companies in the same industry, who tend to suffer at similar times. They use a metric called relative total shareholder return (TSR) and benchmark it against a pre-determined group of peer companies - making it possible for executives to get big payouts even if their companies' stocks lose value.
That system means the heavy shareholder losses expected this year will likely not translate to big reductions in CEO stock awards because the pandemic hit all oil companies in roughly equal measure.
WINNING FOR LOSING
With relative TSR as a key component of pay packages, energy company CEOs have been winning for losing for at least a decade. Investors, meanwhile, have just been losing. The total return of the S&P 500 Energy Index (SPNY) is 1% over the past decade, as of May 26, a period when the broader S&P 500’s total return rose by 243%. 
Slightly more than one-third of S&P 500 companies benchmark relative TSR against a broad index of firms. No energy companies do, according to compensation research firm Exequity LLP.
Some of the worst performers in the energy sector recently awarded executives multi-million dollar payments as motivation to stay put and manage through the downturn. Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK), for example, handed out $25 million in cash bonuses to executives just before it disclosed in May that it was considering bankruptcy.
Chesapeake did not respond to requests for comment. 
Ben Dell, managing partner at investment firm Kimmeridge, said oil and gas firms are telling investors to be grateful the system works because, in some cases, CEOs are not getting 100% of their performance-based payouts.
""The abuse has been going on for years,"" said Dell, a critic of excessive executive compensation whose firm buys stakes in underperforming energy companies to push for change.
He said investors would benefit from reforms in CEO pay structures, but that the barriers to change are high because investors generally put little pressure on companies to rein in executive pay.
In proxy votes, investors overwhelmingly approve CEO pay packages in all sectors of the U.S. economy, including energy, regardless of stock performance. Average say-on-pay support in the energy sector was 90% in 2019, according to research firm Semler Brossy Consulting Group LLC. At NOV's May 20 annual meeting, executive compensation received more than 90% support from shareholders. 
Exequity senior advisor Ben Burney, a leading expert on relative TSR, said it is fair for energy firms to judge their executives through comparisons to peers with similar business models. The volatility of energy prices makes broader comparisons more difficult, he said. 
""If you are at the top of the group, you get more. If you're at the bottom of the group you get less,"" Burney said. ""You don't have to reset goals with the ebb and flow of energy prices.""
A $1.3 MILLION PAYOUT AS SHAREHOLDERS LOSE BIG
More than 90% of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies use relative TSR to calculate long-term stock incentives for senior executives, Burney said. Across the S&P 500, 60% of companies use relative TSR.
The use of relative TSR has helped top executives at the 15 largest oil and gas producers receive more than $2 billion in reported compensation in the last decade, said Doug Terreson, an energy analyst at Evercore ISI.
For example,  Devon Energy  Corp (N:DVN) CEO David Hager received $1.3 million in stock at the end of January as a reward for total shareholder returns falling by 41% over three years. That was good enough for an 11th place finish among its 15-company peer group, Devon disclosed in its proxy. 
Hager received only 60% of his target grant because Devon's TSR was below median performance in the peer group. The previous year, he received no TSR-related payout because Devon ranked 13th out of 15 peers. 
A spokesman for Devon declined to comment.
Over the past three years, Williams of NOV has been paid about $13 million on average annually. In February, he received shares equivalent to 200% of his original 2017 stock grant because the company's relative TSR – a 32% decline in shareholder returns – was in the top quartile of the peer group. 
The company's board of directors increased the number of shares it granted Williams in 2019 to keep his compensation high even as the stock lost value, another common tactic by energy firms over the past three years, according to company filings.
NOV's new cap limits CEOs to collecting 100% of their targeted stock grants if the company posts a negative three-year total return, regardless of how it stacks up against peer firms, according to the company's April proxy filing. That rule did not apply to Williams' payout in February.
INVESTORS FLEE
Many investors have lost patience with the poor returns of energy firms. Shale oil companies helped make the United States the world's largest producer of oil and gas, but that hasn't translated to bottom-line growth.
Since the end of 2016, the market capitalization of the S&P 500 Energy Index (SPNY) has fallen to about $725 billion, down 46%, according to data from financial information provider Refinitiv. Large-capitalization growth mutual funds, such as Fidelity's $100 billion-plus Contrafund (O:FCNTX), have largely avoided energy stocks.
Those left investing in energy are primarily passively managed index funds and smaller investment firms that typically do not have the same capacity to scrutinize executive compensation, nor the reputational heft to influence entrenched boards and management teams.
Some investors are starting to push back, however. They are telling energy companies to include the S&P 500 index in their benchmark peer group. Burney said at least 42% of energy companies have agreed to cap awards if they have negative returns.
Shawn Reynolds, a natural resources portfolio manager at asset manager VanEck, said paying executives based on relative performance – and rewarding negative returns – gives them a warped definition of success.

""Executive compensation has to reflect the experience of the long-term shareholder,"" he said. ""You can't expect to lose 20% of your stock price and get paid just because the industry loses 30%.""

Market researcher Kantar said total UK grocery sales rose 14.3% to 31.4 billion pounds ($38.6 billion) in the 12 weeks to May 17 - a period which includes both the pre-lockdown rush to the shops in March, and eight weeks of stay-at-home advice from the government.
Britain has been in lockdown since March 23, though restrictions are being gradually eased.
The sales increase reflects the shift in demand from the out-of-home market, with pubs, cafes and restaurants closed in the lockdown, to at-home food consumption.
Of Britain's big four grocers, industry leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO) was the best performer with sales up 12.7%, followed by No. 2  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY) with a 12.5% increase. No. 4 Morrisons' (L:MRW) sales rose 9.8%, while Walmart-owned (N:WMT) Asda was the laggard with a 6.5% increase.
The overall star performers were the Co-operative, the No. 6 player, with a sales increase of 30.8%, and online grocer Ocado (L:OCDO), with a rise of 32.5%. And while discounter Aldi's sales rose 10.4% it did see a loss of market share.
Kantar said that in the most recent four-week period to May 17, sales growth accelerated to 17.2% year-on-year as the government announced the first easing of lockdown restrictions.
In the four weeks, the trend towards fewer, larger shops evident in April continued. Kantar said shoppers visited a supermarket 3.5 times per week on average, meaning 100 million fewer trips overall than the same month last year, and increased their spending each trip to 27.41 pounds ($33.7) – nearly 50% more than during pre-crisis times.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) expects Britain to join European nations in dropping COVID-19 quarantine plans in the coming weeks, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said in an interview on Wednesday, reporting a ""big surge"" in holiday bookings from the country. 
Last week Britain announced a 14-day quarantine from June 8 for arrivals from abroad, including citizens, as other nations, such as Italy and Spain, declared plans to ease theirs.
O'Leary, who has described the plan as ""unenforceable"", said many customers in Britain appeared to be ignoring the rules, with booking rates in recent days showing the airline's 1,000 daily flights were likely to be more than half-full in July.
""The UK and Ireland will either quietly drop them or drop them as another easing measure in the next week or two. I am confident of that,"" O'Leary said. 
""There will be movement, because people are just going to ignore it. We have seen a big surge in bookings on our flights out of Ireland and the UK to Spain, Portugal and Italy over the weekend, and that seems to be continuing this week."" 
O'Leary said the booking patterns made him ""reasonably confident"" that the low-cost giant's planes would be 50% to 60% full when it resumes flying 40% of its fleet in July, or about 1,000 flights a day. 
Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) are strong for all the main holiday destinations, including Croatia, France, Greece, Portugal and Spain, he added. Ryanair hopes a busy holiday season will boost confidence in Europe in flying for normal business activity.

1199,By Investing.com,"<span>May 27, 2020 05:43AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Banks Take up the Baton as Cyclical Rally Continues,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It’s another up day in Europe as the news flow provides ever more data points to suggest that the economy is bottoming out and, more importantly, that the policy response is becoming more coherent and effective.
In contrast to the last two days, there are pockets of red on the screen, but they are largely confined to those indices less dominated by cyclicals, which have switched from being the big underperformers to the big outperformers.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.7%, with the Spanish IBEX 35 once again leading the way with a 2.2% gain. It’s now up nearly 7% over the last week, in response to the reopening of the important tourism sector at the weekend.
The underperformers are the Netherlands, where the AEX was dragged down by losses in the tech stocks that had seemed to be the safest haven for much of the last two months:  Prosus  (AS:PRX), Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) and payments company  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN).  Likewise, Copenhagen’s OMXC index, dominated by pharma and renewable energy stocks, is also suffering from the rotation into cyclicals.
After two days when the travel and leisure sector posted the biggest gains, it’s the turn of the beaten-down bank stocks to lead the mean reversion.
The STOXX Banks index was up 4.3% at its highest level since the end of April, and has now rallied 18% in the week since the highly-regarded research house Autonomous argued that the sell-off had gone too far.
Autonomous’ analysts had argued that first-quarter results had held up better than expected, and that policy action from the EU and European Central Bank had helped to remove some of the tail risks facing the sector.
According to data compiled by Investing.com, European banks currently trade at half the value of their assets, a valuation that reflects not only the challenges of making a profit in the negative interest rate environment, but also the very real risk that a large part of their loan book will default as companies go bust and jobless households lose the means to service their debts. It’s easy to see why six of the best 11 performers in Spain this week have been banks, with their high exposure to a sector that represents 11% of GDP.
But from the outset, it has been clear that European policymakers were determined not to let a crisis that started in the real economy infect the financial system and create a destructive vicious spiral. President Emmanuel Macron’s promise that not a single company would be allowed to go bankrupt because of Covid-19 may have been an unrealistic over-simplification, but succeeded in getting the main point across.
That determination at official level is now being underlined with ‘the European Commission’s proposals for a 750 billion-euro European Recovery Fund, two-thirds of which is to be distributed as grants, not loans. While the proposals are likely to be opposed by a handful of smaller member states, the fact that Germany, the union’s paymaster, now supports the idea is a major difference between today and the euro crisis a decade ago.
The markets had judged the EU’s halting initial reaction to the crisis harshly but have shown increasing confidence in it as its institutions have pulled together over the last month. Sovereign bond yield spreads – a rough proxy for eurozone breakup risk – have shrunk to their lowest in seven weeks, another factor supporting bank valuations.
It may be hard to get excited fundamentally about the outlook for European banks, but they are uniquely susceptible to being oversold. The Stoxx 600 banks index is now approaching some tough resistance.  The reaction to today’s Commission paper – and a likely expansion of ECB stimulus next week – will show just how much (or how little) life there is left in the sector."

""We must prepare for a very difficult second quarter,"" Mark Langer told the company's annual general meeting held online.
Langer said conditions were particularly tough in Europe and America which account for about 85% of sales and which are still hit by store closures and restrained consumption patterns.
""We only expect a noticeable but gradual improvement in the market environment from the third quarter at the earliest,"" he said.
Hugo Boss warned earlier this month it expects second quarter sales to fall by at least 50% even though all its stores have reopened in China and are gradually reopening elsewhere.

1202,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>",What $5 Billion in Share Sales May Say About the Market’s Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- With European stocks rallying to the highest in almost three months, companies and big shareholders increasingly are deciding now is the time to sell.
Sellers announced almost $5 billion of stock offerings after the close of trading Tuesday, with large shareholders taking advantage of rebounding indexes to offload stakes and companies raising money to shore up cash balances amid the coronavirus crisis. The sales are fueling worries that the nascent recovery in markets may be nearing its peak.
Building-materials maker Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA sold its holding in Sika AG for 2.6 billion Swiss francs ($2.7 billion) in the largest equity offering in Europe this year, accounting for more than half of last night’s bonanza. Semiconductor company Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies AG raised more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) of fresh capital, the top shareholder in Italian payments firm Nexi (MI:NEXII) SpA marketed 781 million euros of stock and a German foundation pared its stake in Swiss train manufacturer  Stadler Rail  (SIX:SRAIL) AG by 210 million francs.
The huge volume of deals is “not a very good sign for growth and momentum stocks,” said Anthony Benichou, cross-asset sales trader at Louis Capital Markets in London. “It means that insiders see valuations as full, especially in the tech sector where we’re getting close to levels last seen during the bubble in 2000.”
Europe has seen a resurgence in sales of existing stakes after markets stabilized in April, mainly in companies that saw increased demand during lockdown measures as shopping habits changed. Most of these operate in the digital economy, like online food delivery platform Just Eat Takeaway NV and remote-access software provider TeamViewer AG. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index is up 26% from its mid-March low. The benchmark has gained three straight days this week on optimism about economies reopening as the coronavirus outbreak recedes and is heading for its highest close since March 6.
More than $15 billion has been raised on European exchanges this month alone by 84 companies through new share sales and such stake disposals, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, marking the busiest month for equity capital markets this year.
To be sure, the deluge is unlikely to slow down any time soon even if the market rally runs out of steam, some bankers say, because more companies will need to raise cash to shore up balance sheets hammered during the economic downturn or to improve their competitive positioning in after the lockdowns.
Some companies have lost so much of their market capitalization that they are virtually going to have to raise as much equity as in a new listing in the coming weeks, said Philip Noblet, head of U.K. investment banking at Jefferies.
And although sales of existing shares are fast catching up with fresh capital raising, bankers expect new share sales to dominate activity for the foreseeable future, which could be seen as good news for investors who are worried about insiders cashing out.
Though most of the overnight transactions on Tuesday came from more yield-focused sectors, some have growth company valuations. Sika trades at 34 times expected earnings in the next 12 months, its highest price-to-earnings ratio in at least 15 years, and nearly twice the ratio of 18 for the Stoxx 600 Construction & Materials Index.
Not everyone in convinced the flood of overnight share sales signals the stock market rebound from the March lows is losing steam. The surge is more likely to be a “mid-cycle recovery,” said Shaunak Mazumder, a global equities fund manager at Legal & General Investment Management.

Hopes for a co-ordinated fiscal response to the coronavirus crisis have been boosted since France and Germany made proposals for a 500-billion-euro recovery fund. 
Asian markets, however, struggled after fresh protests in Hong Kong over new national security laws proposed by Beijing, while U.S. President Donald Trump warned of a strong response to China's move by the end of this week.

At 4:10 AM ET (08:10 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.8% higher, France's CAC 40 and the U.K.'s FTSE index were up 0.9%.
Earlier Wednesday, ECB Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel indicated, in an interview with the Financial Times, that the central bank was ready to act and use any instrument ""if it judges that the medium-term inflation outlook has worsened."" Her words echoed those of the usually conservative Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau on Tuesday.
Euro area annual inflation was 0.3 % in April, down from 0.7 % in March - some way removed from the ECB’s goal of below, but close to, 2%. 
This suggests more largesse from the central bank is likely, perhaps as soon as next week’s monetary policy meeting.
Schnabel added that the German constitutional court's ruling against the European Central Bank's bond-buying scheme will not directly affect the ECB and will not lead to the Bundesbank having to exit the scheme.
On top of this, the European Commission is set to unveil a plan to help the region’s economy recover from its coronavirus slump with a mix of grants, loans and guarantees exceeding 1 trillion euros.

Tesla also said its Supercharger quick-charging service will no longer be free to new customers of its Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles (SUVs).
Auto retail sales in the United States likely halved in April from a year earlier, showed data from J.D. Power. However, sales in May are likely to improve due to pent-up demand and incentives offered by most carmakers, the analytics firm said.
Automakers including General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), are offering 0% financing rates and deferred payment options for new purchases.
Factories in the United States started to reopen earlier this month with suppliers gearing up to support an auto industry employing nearly 1 million people. 
Tesla was briefly forced to stop work at its Fremont, California, factory due to stay-at-home orders. It resumed production after resolving a dispute over safety measures with local authorities.
On Wednesday, Tesla website's showed the starting price for its Model S sedan is now $74,990, down from $79,990.
Its Model X SUVs are now priced at $79,990, from $84,990, and the lowest-priced Model 3 sedan is $2,000 cheaper at $37,990.

1209,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2020 03:36AM ET</span>",Airlines Are Gathering Momentum for a Short Haul,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the few sectors left behind in the sharp April rebound has finally taken off. European airlines have rallied hard in the past few days, spurred by bailouts and economies reopening. Full recovery may still be a long way down the line, but investors don’t want to be left behind.
The Bloomberg EMEA Airlines Index has finally broken out of a tight range that held for more than two months. The index is up 32% since May 15, but such was the extent of the sector’s drop that it’s still down 45% for the year.
There’s been a string of positive news recently for the sector. Economies are slowly reopening across Europe, and tourists on the continent are likely to be able to travel this summer, even though Germany’s decision on travel warning was postponed to June 3. At a corporate level, there has been government support or bailouts for legacy airlines such as Air France-KLM and  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY).
Bailouts and state-guaranteed loans come at a price though. Airlines are likely to end up with high levels of debt and potentially less management flexibility in cases where states become shareholders. In Lufthansa’s case, note that the EU already made some demands on airport slots, while Ryanair Holdings (NASDAQ:RYAAY) Plc said it will appeal the aid. As for Air France-KLM, the carrier already started talks with unions to cut staff and capacity.
According to airlines association IATA, 55% of government aid made available to airlines due to Covid-19 crisis will create debt. Overall, airlines’ debt is expected to surge from $430 billion at end-2019 to $550 billion at end-2020, a nearly 28% increase.
This wouldn’t be a major problem if demand was expected to pick up fast, but that’s hardly the case. For example, British Airways already warned it doesn’t see demand reaching pre-crisis levels before 2023.
Other changes prompted by the pandemic will also weigh on the sector. The U.K.’s decision to impose a fortnight’s quarantine on travelers entering or coming back to the country is a blow to the industry, given Britain is by far the biggest European market by ticket revenue, according to IATA, and also the least “state-sponsored,” as shown in the chart below.
Profitability will likely continue to suffer, especially given that company travel isn’t expected to recover rapidly either. Just a 1% impact on corporate volumes would erode airline profits by 10%,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). analysts say. They also generate 40% of revenue, with only 15% of passengers. Looking at the chart below, the rout in earnings forecast is unprecedented, and some recovery on that front may be needed to justify further gains.
Looking at single stocks, Ryanair and Wizz Air Holdings Plc are the only two “investable airlines,” Citi analysts including Mark Manduca said on Monday. According to them, both IAG (LON:ICAG) SA and EasyJet Plc are likely to raise more capital in the coming months, while there is very little equity left in Lufthansa, no matter how much money the German government provides the airline.

HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Hong Kong's exchange is launching derivatives with index provider MSCI in a deal that hurts rival Singapore and boosts its global appeal amid U.S. warnings that Chinese pressure on the city’s autonomy threatens its future as a financial hub.
The announcement comes days after China's National People's Congress said it would impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong, which U.S. government officials have warned could bring into question the city's special economic status under U.S. law.
On Tuesday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said president Donald Trump had told her ""it’s hard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub if China takes over.""
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388) said on Wednesday it will launch Asia and emerging markets futures and options contracts under a licence deal with  MSCI Inc  (N:MSCI), giving it access to a suite of MSCI equity indexes. HKEX said it will launch an initial 37 futures and options contracts.
The contracts are currently listed on Singapore Exchange (OTC:SPXCY) Ltd (SGX) (SI:SGXL). SGX said in a separate statement that it would not renew its licencing agreement with MSCI when it expires in February 2021, other than for the MSCI Singapore index. 
""What we saw in Hong Kong exchanges was a larger customer base, particularly the access to Chinese institutional and retail investors, said Henry Fernandez, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at MSCI. ""We also saw the ability to have a large market for index options and that market is the gateway to structured products."" 
HKEX shares dropped 0.3%, beating a 1% fall in the benchmark Hang Seng Index (HSI).
""The potential boost to derivative trading volumes would not only increase HKEX's revenues but also help it diversify away from its main cash equities business,"" said Elizabeth Kwik, Asian equities investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds shares in both firms
SGX shares, suspended in the morning session, fell 10% on resuming trading, their sharpest one-day fall since 2008 and were down 11.8% by mid-afternoon, 
The Singapore bourse said that the loss of the contracts could hit its 12-month net profit by between 10 and 15%.
INTERNATIONAL AMBITIONS
HKEX Chief Executive Charles Li said that international and Asia-focused products were a ""key missing part of the puzzle"" for HKEX, as investors typically came to the bourse to trade HK and mainland China linked products.
Li denied that there was any political aspect to the announcement.
""This is a commercial arrangement that has its own timing and its own processes. We are not coinciding with anything ... politics comes and politics goes,"" said Li. 
He said that he did not see recent political developments having any effect on ""Hong Kong's unique position as a connector"". 
The Hong Kong bourse, which bought the London Metal Exchange in 2012 and failed in a bid for the  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) last year, said in its 2019 three-year strategic plan that it wanted to diversify the range of products it offers, which have typically focused on its China links.

The new contracts, which will use the MSCI Emerging Markets Asia, MSCI China Free, MSCI Singapore and MSCI India indices, among others, are subject to local regulatory approval.

The online share of 13% of the grocery market in the four weeks to May 16 was up from 7% at the same time last year and 10% higher than in April, Market researcher Nielsen said.
Nielsen said 7.9 million British households placed an online grocery order, up from 4.8 million during the same period last year, including 1.1 million new online shoppers.
While online sales soared 103% year-on-year, sales growth in stores was 6.6%, despite visits to the shops being down 24%. 
But the amount shoppers spent on each visit they did make was up 45%, with an average basket value of 21.6 pounds, reflecting a change in behaviour during the lockdown.
""Following over eight weeks in lockdown, UK shoppers are more accustomed to restricted living, and have adapted their grocery shopping habits to match,"" said Mike Watkins, Nielsen’s UK head of retailer and business insight.
""Online has been a clear winner ... as shoppers take advantage of retailers’ increased delivery capacity.”
Overall UK grocery sales increased by 13% year-on-year, further emphasising a shift to the eat-out-of-home market to the supermarket sector as pubs, cafes and restaurants have been closed during the lockdown. 

The biggest gainer during the 12 week period to May 16 was market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO), with sales up 11.7%, while  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT) and Morrisons (L:MRW) rose by 11.0%, 5.7% and 9.4% respectively.

SAA is under a form of bankruptcy protection and suspended all commercial passenger flights in late March, when the government imposed one of Africa's strictest lockdowns.
""The position around the cessation of flights remains as is until SAA has a better sense of what the level 3 lockdown means in terms of domestic air travel,"" SAA's administrators, Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana, said in a statement. 
""The airline also needs to consider what the opening of the skies will mean from a commercial and load factor perspective.""
Matuson and Dongwana said they had not vetted Tuesday's statement from the airline, adding that SAA's future funding remained a key variable for any resumption of flights.
SAA has not made a profit since 2011 and has mainly relied on bailouts for survival and the government has told the administrators it would not provide further funding.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Sunday that domestic air travel for business purposes would be phased in after June 1, when the country moves to level 3 of a five-level alert system.

The S&P 500 Index’s three-month realized correlation has steadied around the 0.8 level, its highest in about eight years, even though other gauges of market stress such as the Cboe Volatility Index have retreated toward normal levels. The divergence suggests investors continue to focus on just one main driver -- the global coronavirus pandemic -- making it harder for active fund managers to beat their benchmarks.
From beginning the year with a correlation of 0.19, the gauge of how closely the top stocks in the S&P 500 move in relation to one another spiked to 0.85 in mid-March, toward the peak of the coronavirus sell-off before leveling off around 0.8. A maximum possible correlation of 1.0 would signify all stocks are moving in lockstep.
Higher correlations spell trouble for active managers looking to beat indexes through stock picking. If most equities are moving in the same direction, it’s difficult to choose one that stands out from the crowd.

Earlier this week, Regeneron had said it would repurchase about $5 billion of its shares directly from Sanofi, without altering their over-a-decade-long partnership.
Sanofi is selling the Regeneron shares at $515.00 per share - a discount of around 5.5% to Regeneron's closing price of $545.21 on May 26, and raising gross proceeds of $11.1 billion.
Sanofi will continue to own approximately 400,000 shares of Regeneron's common stock.
Sanofi could end up raising $11.7 billion, if the underwriters on the deal exercise their option to buy up a further 1.2 million Regeneron shares.
The collaboration between Sanofi and Regeneron dates back to 2003 and has resulted in five approved treatments to date - including eczema drug Dupixent - with additional candidates in clinical development.

Investment banks Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS),  Barclays  (LON:BARC), BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JP Morgan and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) worked on Sanofi's Regeneron stake sale.

1218,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 01:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Volkswagen in final talks to seal biggest M&A deals in China EV sector - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Edward Taylor
HONG KONG/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) is in final talks to seal its largest investment deals with Chinese electric vehicle (EV) firms, two sources said, as the German automaker accelerates its push into the world's largest market for environmentally friendlier cars.
The firm is poised to buy 50% of Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Holding, the parent of EV partner JAC Motors (SS:600418), for at least 3.5 billion yuan ($491 million), the people said on condition of anonymity as the matter was private.
It is also set to become the biggest shareholder of EV battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd (SZ:002074), the people said, adding both deals could be announced as early as Friday.
Volkswagen declined to comment on the deals, details of which are reported here for the first time. JAC and Guoxuan declined to comment. 
The deals highlight how Volkswagen is keen to retain its status as the largest foreign automaker in China even as government virus-busting measures decimate sales, in the face of encroaching rivals such as Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) which last year became the first foreign automaker to wholly own a car plant.
At the end of last year when 25 million vehicles were sold in China - and just before the coronavirus was first reported in December - the government targeted 25% of 2025 annual vehicle sales to be made up of new energy vehicles.
The deals would make Volkswagen the latest foreign automaker to increase ownership in China since the government started to relax ownership rules in 2018 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-autos-regulation/china-to-open-auto-market-as-trade-tensions-simmer-idUSKBN1HO0YA, with Germany's BMW AG (DE:BMWG) quick to take control of its main local venture.
Volkswagen target Anhui Jianghuai, based in the eastern city of Hefei, is fully state owned. It counts its core asset as its 25.23% stake in JAC - formally Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Corp Ltd, which has a market value of $1.84 billion.
The Anhui provincial office of the State-owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission declined to comment.
After completing the deal, Volkswagen plans to invest fresh capital in its 50:50 venture with JAC and build capacity with its modular MEB platform, an architecture enabling efficient production of various EV models, said one of the people.
JAC shares surged by their maximum 10% on the news on Wednesday, to trade at their highest level since mid-April last year.
Shanghai-listed JAC last week said its parent planned to bring in a strategic investor, which will not cause change in its control.
Volkswagen's purchase of a stake in Shenzhen-listed Guoxuan, also based in Hefei, would mark it first direct ownership in a Chinese battery maker.
It plans to buy about 27% of Guoxuan mostly via a discounted private share placement as well as from top shareholder Zhuhai Guoxuan Trading Ltd, which holds 18%, and founder Li Zhen, who owns 12%, said one of the people. Son Li Chen also owns 2.5%, showed filings to the stock exchange this month.
Based on Guoxuan's market capitalisation of $4.3 billion, a 27% stake is worth $1.16 billion.
Zhuhai Guoxuan and Li Zhen could not immediately be reached for comment.
Guoxuan has suspended trading of its stock since May 20 and on Tuesday said Zhuhai Guoxuan and Li Zhen would sell part of their holdings to an unidentified strategic investor. It said it will also issue shares to the investor via a private offering.
The deals have yet to be finalised and investment sizes may change as negotiations continue, the people said.
Volkswagen also has ventures with state-owned China FAW Group Corp Ltd and SAIC Motor Corp Ltd (SS:600104). It aims to sell 1.5 million new energy vehicles a year in China by 2025. 

""Volkswagen consistently searches for ways to strengthen and deepen our relationships with local partners,"" Volkswagen told Reuters. ""In this regard we will explore possible options together with all stakeholders to secure long-term success.""

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning, with shares in the Greater China region down after protestors planned to take to the streets for the second time this week in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong’s Legislative Council will debate a controversial national anthem bill, which triggered the latest round of protests in the city. They re-ignited on Sunday after China tabled a national security law for Hong Kong and Macau at the end of the previous week.
U.S. President Donald Trump said overnight that his administration is “doing something now” to be unveiled later this week.
“It’s something you’re going to be hearing about over the next -- before the end of the week. Very powerfully, I think,” he said.
The Treasury Department could impose controls on transactions and freeze assets of Chinese officials and businesses involved with enacting the law, with visa restrictions for Chinese Communist Party officials also under consideration.
Trump also believed that Hong Kong’s status as a financial hub will be lost if the laws are enacted, with White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany saying during Tuesday’s briefing, “I went directly to the president to get an answer on this, and he said to me that he’s displeased with China’s efforts and that it’s hard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub if China takes over.""
Investor risk sentiment soured over fears of mounting U.S.-China tensions.
“Mounting US-China tensions bodes ominous for the global economy amid pandemic fragilities,” Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, said in a note.

1221,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 26, 2020 11:09PM ET</span>","Tokyo Governor Koike to Run for Re-Election in July, Paper Says","(Bloomberg) -- Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, the first woman to win election to one of the highest-profile posts in Japanese politics, has decided to run for re-election in a vote set for July, the Yomiuri newspaper said.
The former television newscaster looks set to sail to victory, riding on public support for her management of the coronavirus crisis, including near-daily media appearances to explain her policies. A poll this week found she was rated better than Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on containing Covid-19.
Koike plans to formally declare her candidacy next month and run as an independent, the newspaper reported Wednesday, citing unidentified officials. The vote is scheduled for July 5.
The election in Tokyo would be the biggest in Japan since it was hit by Covid-19 and is likely to require measures aimed at preventing a further spread of the virus during voting in the city of more than 13 million people.
The Tokyo governor has hinted at a run for re-election for months, which would allow her to be in office when Tokyo is set to host the Olympics in 2021. But the games -- which were pushed back from this July due to the pandemic -- remain in a precarious position, with the virus still raging and costs for the $12 billion sports extravaganza continuing to mount.
Four years ago, Koike resigned from her seat in parliament to run in the capital’s election. Making strong use of social media and pledging to cut the cost of hosting the Olympics, the former Environment Minister beat 20 opponents, including one backed by Abe’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, of which she had been a prominent member.
Koike then tried to capitalize on her position by launching a bid to topple Abe, which failed when he called a snap general election before she was fully prepared.
Abe Set for Victory in Japan Election as Opponents Bicker
Despite lingering rancor, Koike is likely to have at least the tacit acceptance of the LDP, which will not run a candidate against her this time around. Party Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai told reporters this month that he saw no problem supporting her.
Lawyer and anti-poverty campaigner Kenji Utsunomiya announced on Twitter that he was planning to run, while Takafumi Horie, an entrepreneur who spent time in prison for securities fraud, is also set to throw his hat in the ring, according to the Sankei newspaper.

Industrial profits dropped 4.3% in April from a year ago, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday. That was much smaller than the almost 35% drop in March.
Profits contracted 27.4% in the first four months of the year and were down 46% at state-owned enterprises and 17.2% at private companies. Auto industry profits rose 29.5% in April after dropping 80.4% in March.
The improvement in April was due to faster production and sales, as well as an significant increase in investment returns and the comparison with a weak period in 2019, NBS official Zhu Hong said in the statement.
The slow recovery of the economy looks set to continue into May, according to a set of early indicators compiled by Bloomberg. Manufacturing is also forecast to have improved.
However, deeper producer prices deflation and sluggish external demand will likely continue to drag down company profits. Prices at the factory gate declined 3.1% in April and that is expected to get worse this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is expected to announce U.S. job cuts this week after disclosing last month it planned to shed 10% of its worldwide workforce of 160,000 employees, people briefed on the plans and a union said.
A spokesman for the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) union that represents 17,600 Boeing employees told Reuters Tuesday the company informed the union it should expect layoff notices on Friday.
Boeing declined to comment.
In April, Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun said the company had ""begun taking action to lower our number of employees by roughly 10% through a combination of voluntary layoffs, natural turnover and involuntary layoffs as necessary.""
Calhoun said in April Boeing will need to make ""even deeper reductions in areas that are most exposed to the condition of our commercial customers — more than 15% across our commercial airplanes and services businesses, as well as our corporate functions.""
SPEEA said about 1,300 of its members applied to take voluntary layoffs.
The Puget Sound Business Journal reported earlier that Boeing planned to layoff thousands of workers.
A union official confirmed the newspaper's report that Boeing had told union leaders to expect cuts of between 15 to 20% of its membership, which represents engineers and technical workers in Washington State and southern California.
Boeing is struggling as the worldwide airline sector has been rocked by the travel demand falloff from the coronavirus pandemic.
In April, Boeing recorded zero orders for the second time this year and customers canceled another 108 orders for its grounded 737 MAX plane compounding its worst start to a year since 1962.

The outbreak worsened a crisis following the second of two fatal crashes that led to the grounding of the 737 MAX in March 2019. Calhoun said on May 8 he expected to resume production of grounded 737 MAX jet this month.

Introduced in January, the trading platform allows shareholders to sell their rights entitlement to others interested in subscribing to the share sale. Reliance’s rights entitlement began trading on May 20 at 151.15 rupees -- the difference between the closing price of 1,408.2 rupees on May 19 and the rights price of 1,257 rupees -- and settled at 181.6 rupees Tuesday on the National Stock Exchange.
“This is the perfect start to the platform because you’re seeing the excitement on both the buying and the selling side,” said Sameer Kalra, a strategist at Mumbai-based  Target  (NYSE:TGT) Investing. “The progress of this platform will depend on more large-cap companies coming forward and using it.”
The rights issue of the firm controlled by Mukesh Ambani is attracting new investors after it raked in $10 billion of investments into digital services unit Jio by selling stakes to companies including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). Asia’s richest tycoon is steering the conglomerate into newer consumer businesses, and the fund raising gives investors a chance to bet on him pulling off the transformation.
French bank Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA’s unit picked up 3.3 million of Reliance’s rights entitlements at 182 rupees on May 20, according to data from the NSE. As many as 29 million of the securities traded that day, surpassing the number of Reliance shares that changed hands, the data show. Volumes have since ebbed and totaled 15.12 million on Tuesday. The entitlements can be traded until May 29.
Reliance’s rights issue to its 2.3 million shareholders offers one share for every 15 held in the company at 1,257 rupees apiece. The stock fell 0.5% to close at 1,424 rupees on Tuesday.
“Now, there is more clarity for investors as Jio will be separate from retail and petrochem businesses,” said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “The sum of the parts will be greater than the current holding company structure. This will be a good opportunity for investors from a five-year perspective.”

1228,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 26, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",Latest India Rate Cut Is Adding to Record Corporate Bond Sales,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s latest interest-rate cut last week is already showing signs of adding to record corporate bond sales, as firms build cash buffers to counter the pandemic.
The pipeline of deals is growing with at least three state issuers seeking bids for as much as 110 billion rupees ($1.5 billion) of bonds on Wednesday. That would add to the 1.4 trillion rupees already raised by mainly top-rated businesses in Asia’s third-largest economy through domestic note sales since April 1, the best start to a financial year on record.
Yields on top-rated three-year rupee bonds slid to a 16-year low on Friday, the day Governor Shaktikanta Das reduced the repurchase rate to the least since the measure was introduced in 2000 and pointed to more easing.
The unprecedented offerings underscore a push to stockpile cash as the Covid-19 pandemic hits revenue across Asia’s third-largest economy. And that’s just for the lucky companies that are able to raise money. Policy steps to channel more funds to smaller borrowers have struggled to gain traction, and most lower-rated firms have found creditors increasingly hesitant amid the crisis.
Investor appetite to lend to non triple A companies continues to be weak, said Shameek Ray, head of debt capital markets at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd.
India’s credit market was roiled by the news late last month that Franklin Templeton’s India unit, a big buyer of high-yield rupee bonds, was shutting six debt funds. There have been growing concerns delinquencies may spike as the economy is on track to shrink for the first time in more than four decades.
The rate cut came after the Reserve Bank of India from end March began funding banks’ purchases of corporate bonds to the tune of 1 trillion rupees via targeted long-term repo operations.
“The frenzy to borrow via rupee bonds was due to the RBI’s cheap liquidity operation,” said Ashish Ghiya, managing director at Derivium Genev, one of India’s largest corporate bond brokers. “Excess liquidity and the policy-rate cut should maintain the issuance momentum.”
To counter the virus-related slowdown, the government this month announced a 21-trillion-rupee economic package, which includes loan guarantees for small businesses, a special credit line for shadow lenders and a suspension of new insolvency proceedings for up to a year.

In mid-May, officials said the industry could exit a mandatory coronavirus lockdown before June 1 if safety measures were approved.
However, some Mexican governors have urged caution as new coronavirus infections and deaths ticked higher, in a sign of what is expected to be a bumpy return as complex North American supply chains are linked back together.
Fiat Chrysler on Tuesday began reopening two facilities in the central Mexican city of Toluca after a gradual restart of its operations in the northern city of Saltillo a day earlier, said a company spokesman. 
""We are opening up with only 40% of personnel at each plant. It's an orderly and secure reopening, following all the protocols the Health Secretary has given us,"" he said.
The announcement means two of Detroit's Big Three automakers have begun restarting Mexican operations. The third, Ford, said on Tuesday it was working closely with the government to comply with health protocols.
""We're hoping we can get its approval to operate,"" the company said in a statement. 
BMW said it would restart operations at its plant in the central Mexican state of San Luis Potosi on May 27.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New Jersey used car dealer was criminally charged on Tuesday with exploiting the coronavirus pandemic by trying to defraud and price gouge New York City into buying N95 respirator masks in a roughly $45 million scheme.
The U.S. Department of Justice said Ronald Romano, 58, sought quick riches in late March when his Performance Supply LLC tried to sell 7 million of the 3M-branded masks to New York City's Office of Citywide Procurement for about 500% above the typical list price.
Prosecutors said the Manalapan, New Jersey, resident created a bogus letter falsely showing that 3M Co (N:MMM) authorized the sale.
He was also accused of offering to sell 3 million Mexican-made N99 face masks to Florida's Division of Emergency Management for $5.46 million, a more than 500% markup.
Prosecutors said Romano's intentions were clear from a March 9 text to an accomplice: ""I'm working on a few deals that if I get any of them you might be buying a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE).""
They also said that after being warned on March 31 the FBI might investigate suspected price gouging, Romano responded: ""I thought we are a free market of supply and demand?""
Mark Macron, a lawyer for Romano, declined immediate comment. Romano faces wire fraud and two conspiracy charges. Two counts carry maximum 30-year prison terms. Bail was set at $200,000 in an afternoon teleconference.
""Ronald Romano saw the current health emergency as an opportunity to cash in,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a statement. ""Now Ronald Romano's short-lived second career as a purveyor of vital protective gear is over.""
3M, the world's largest maker of N95 masks, on May 4 won an injunction against Performance Supply's sale of them. The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company has filed at least 10 similar lawsuits.

William Childs, a 3M senior counsel, said the company was happy to see law enforcement's continued involvement.

1231,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>",Renault and Nissan rebuild their alliance to ride out the coronavirus storm,"By Naomi Tajitsu and Gilles Guillaume
TOKYO/PARIS (Reuters) - When  Renault  SA (PA:RENA), Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) announced the last strategy plan for their Alliance in September 2017, the goal was to become the world's biggest automaker by 2022.
On Wednesday, the Alliance partners will outline a new plan with a less lofty objective: survival.
""There will be restructuring, there will be fixed costs reductions, there will be a number of projects which will be reduced,"" a person with knowledge of the plan told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement.
The three carmakers are reeling from the coronavirus pandemic which engulfed them just as they were trying to rework their partnership after the arrest in 2018 and subsequent ouster of its chairman and chief architect, Carlos Ghosn.
Profits are plunging at all three automakers and thousands of jobs will be at risk as Renault and Nissan announce separate restructuring plans later this week. 
The reworked Alliance is expected to focus on more systematic divisions of labour, with one partner leading for a particular type of vehicle and geography while the others follow.
""The plan will have a positive spirit, based on a clear leader-follower scheme and on complementarity between companies,"" a source close to Renault said.
Years of bickering over cost sharing and capital structures have meant the Alliance has so far largely failed to convert its global scale into a competitive advantage beyond the joint procurement of parts.
The French state, which already owns 15% of Renault, will now become a not-so-silent partner in the Alliance.
Renault is seeking 5 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in state guaranteed loans to help weather the hit to sales from the global pandemic. In return, the French government wants Renault to invest in electric vehicles, advanced batteries and other technology to support jobs in France.
Another big question will be the place of German automaker  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) in the Alliance. Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) joined the Franco-Japanese partnership in 2010, promising cost savings for future vans, small engines and pick-up trucks. But common projects have since become few and far between.
Working together has posed challenges to Renault, Nissan and junior partner Mitsubishi, which joined the alliance in 2016, due to differences in corporate cultures and simmering tensions over the Alliance's capital structure.
Renault owns 43% of Nissan while Nissan has 15% of the French carmaker, but no voting rights. This structure has caused friction in Japan, ever since Renault saved its bigger partner from financial ruin in 1999. 
Ghosn championed steps toward a full merger, which Nissan has strongly opposed. 
Alliance Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard earlier this year said that the automakers had ""no other option"" but to deepen cooperation, though senior alliance sources say any talk of a full-blown merger has been shelved for now.

The case centres on the ownership of RCS's historic headquarters in central Milan, which Blackstone bought from RCS for 120 million euros ($131.71 million).
RCS, owner of newspaper Corriere della Sera, launched arbitration proceedings in Milan in 2018 to nullify the sale, saying Blackstone took control of the headquarters at too low a price, while RCS faced financial difficulties. It asked that the transaction be annulled.
Blackstone in turn has accused RCS of falsely claiming that it still owns the property and of improperly blocking it from selling it to Germany's Allianz SE (DE:ALVG).
The U.S. investment firm filed two lawsuits in New York, one against RCS and the other directly against RCS's chairman and controlling shareholder, Urbano Cairo. They were put on hold last year pending the outcome of the arbitration in Italy.
The Arbitral Tribunal ordered two expert witnesses to report separately on the condition of RCS in 2013 and on the market value of the property, the Italian company said on Tuesday.
This is a partial and nondefinitive decision and the arbitration proceeding continues, RCS added in its statement.
A Blackstone representative said the company was ""pleased that in this ruling, the arbitrators have dismissed the overwhelming majority of RCS’ claims, and have confirmed the validity of the contract in which RCS sold the building in 2013.""
The sale followed a year-long, fully transparent auction process, it was approved by RCS’s board and auditors, and was supported by a leading Italian bank, Blackstone said, adding it will continue to seek ""compensation for the meaningful and growing damages caused by RCS.""

Investing.com - Gamestop fell in after-market hours Tuesday after the video game retailer urged shareholders to back its board nominees rather than those proposed by activist investors Hestia Capital Partners and Permit Capital Enterprise Fund.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) was down nearly 1% postmarket.
Insisting that the activist investors would add no value at boardroom level, the company said ""Messrs. Wolf and Evans’ lack of retail and video game experience disqualifies them from serving on GameStop’s board, as they would be ill-prepared to advise on the strategic and operational issues facing specialty retail companies in this turbulent market environment.""
The battle for seats on the board comes at a time of transformation for the retailer as consumers have shied away from buying games in retail shops, moving toward online.
""Over the last two years, we have comprehensively refreshed our Board to oversee our business transformation strategy – GameStop Reboot. Our refreshed Board benefits from the fresh perspectives of our newest directors and the institutional memory of our longest-serving directors, all of which is critical to our successful execution of this transformation plan,"" Gamestop said."

Investing.com - Stocks posted strong gains to start the week, but they could’ve bene stronger if not for a late swoon on more worries about China-U.S. tensions.
Tomorrow investors will get a broad look at the economy from all the regional Fed banks.
There will be a measure of how U.S. oil inventories are shaping up as oil continues to climb and also earnings from the homebuilding sector.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Lockdown Beige Book Arrives
The Federal Reserve will release its Beige Book assessment of the economy at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
The report should take on extra importance for its unprecedented glimpse into the pandemic economy.
Views will come from the 12 Fed districts, giving insight into how different parts of the country handled lockdown measures and early moves to reopen.
2. API Inventories on Tap
Oil prices rose the wave of reopening optimism as well today, with WTI futures getting closer to $35 per barrel.
With anticipation of growing demand, investors will get a measure of how U.S. stockpiles look when the American Petroleum Institute gives its gauge after the bell. It arrives a day later due to Monday’s holiday.
Last week API reported a drop of 4.8 million barrels in oil inventories.
Seevol.com reported a 4.26-million-barrel decline for the week to May 22 at the Cushing, Okla. hub that stores crude delivered against expiring spot contracts of WTI.
3. Will Housing Resilience Show in Earnings?
Luxury homebuilder  Toll Brothers  (NYSE:TOL) will report earnings after the bell tomorrow and the numbers come on the heels of very surprising new home sales data.
Economists were predicting a drop of more than 20% in sales of new homes in April, but they posted a small gain.
“With incredibly attractive mortgage rates and pent-up demand from first-time buyers, there are reports of bidding wars at several times the previous pace,” Grant Thornton Associate Economist Yelena Maleyev wrote in a note. “Realtors report increased interest in virtual tours and self-guided tours of empty houses.”
Analysts predict a profit of 46 cents per share for the quarter, with sales of nearly $1.6 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com."
1238,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 26, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",Bank of Korea Seen Cutting Rates to New Record,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of Korea is expected to cut its key interest rate to a fresh record low and announce more bond purchases this week as the pandemic takes a toll on exports essential to the country’s economy.
Eighteen of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the BOK to cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, while one said it could be reduced by twice as much. The rest forecast no change at 0.75% after an emergency cut in March and unprecedented steps to extend liquidity to firms and financial markets.
Even though South Korea has made progress in controlling the domestic outbreak, the economic pullback is far from over. Exports are plunging as many trade partners struggle to end lockdowns, while consumers remain wary of traveling or shopping. Inflation has slowed sharply to near zero.
“The risk of second-wave infection remains in place and domestic economic activities are still below normal,” said DBS Bank economist Tieying Ma. “The deeply negative output gap and the rise in deflation risks should continue to put pressure on the BOK to cut rates.”
The BOK is also set to update growth and inflation forecasts. Analysts will be watching to see whether the board maintains its relative optimism after Governor Lee Ju-yeol last month said he still sees the economy eking out growth this year. Private sector economists surveyed by Bloomberg project a 0.5% contraction in 2020.
Many analysts expect the central bank to beef up bond purchases as the government’s third extra budget is underway. President Moon Jae-in said Monday the proposal would be bigger than the previous two, which were around $10 billion each. He has pledged to use the budget to fund what he’s called a “New Deal” project to boost growth and jobs once the outbreak subsides.
Korea’s Budget Plans Fan Bets for BOK to Step Up Bond Purchases
The BOK will cut once more this year, but more likely in July than this month, according to Angela Hsieh, an economist for  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Bank PLC. “The BOK may prefer to time the rate cut with the third fiscal policy package to maximize the impact, considering its limited policy ammunition.”
Unlike some of its counterparts, the BOK has never publicly mentioned what it sees as the lower bound of its key interest rate. At 0.75% though, it doesn’t have much room as South Korean policy makers are wary of taking rates too low and risking capital outflows.
The BOK has taken a series of unprecedented actions to re-energize the economy since cutting its interest rate by 50 basis points in March. It has pledged unlimited liquidity through June via repurchase agreements and started lending to brokerages. Last week, it said it would buy corporate debt including lower-rated bonds and commercial paper via a special purpose vehicle.
Thursday’s decision will be the first attended by three new board members that include Cho Yoon-je, seen as an architect of Moon’s economic agenda. The other two newcomers are also viewed as supportive of the current government stimulus, based on their comments upon joining the board last month.
The BOK is expected to release its decision around 10 a.m. on Thursday and publish its policy statement about half an hour later. New economic forecasts will be released at Governor Lee’s press conference, which typically starts after 11 a.m.

1239,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 26, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",Bank Stocks Are Either Cheap or Signal More Pain,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Something strange happened in the U.S. stock market on Tuesday.
No, it wasn’t that the S&P 500 crossed 3,000 for the first time in almost three months, generating a yelp of joy from the White House and groans from Wall Street veterans who remain perplexed at the seeming disconnect between financial markets and the American economy.
Rather, the most unusual part of the latest rally is that bank shares clearly led the advance. As of last week, Bloomberg’s 18-company S&P 500 Banks Index was down more than 40% in 2020, trailing the broader stock market by an almost unprecedented degree since the coronavirus pandemic shut down the world’s largest economy. However, the index soared 9% on Tuesday, far and away a bigger gain than any of the other 23 industry groups. 
A simple ratio of this bank index to the broad S&P 500 shows the extent to which financials have been beaten down so far in 2020 relative to other segments of the stock market. The gauge fell on May 13 to a level seen only twice before in data going back three decades, both in March 2009. The banks swiftly rebounded in the following months as the U.S. recession officially drew to a close in June of that year.
As investors weigh the drastic gains on Wall Street against the backdrop of widespread unemployment and shuttered small businesses on Main Street, the performance of bank stocks may prove to be a crucial barometer of whether markets can sustain their exuberance. Few analysts dispute that shares of financial companies are cheap on a relative basis — but sometimes prices are depressed for good reasons. Inexpensiveness alone isn’t a compelling enough reason to expect banks to bounce back as they did in 2009. Instead, perhaps more than any other industry, a lasting rally will come down to investors’ conviction in a sharp and sustained economic recovery.
Investors have a few obvious reasons to be wary of U.S. banks. For one, long-term interest rates are near record lows while traders have started to wager on negative short-term rates, even as Federal Reserve officials repeatedly question the policy. All this points to lower net interest income, a crucial metric that reflects the spread between what a company earns on its loans and what it pays on its deposits. Meanwhile, large banks have already halted share buybacks, and minutes from April’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting revealed that policy makers are debating whether they should also restrict their ability to pay dividends to shareholders during the pandemic.
Whether those downsides merit a $1 trillion wipeout, akin to the 2008 financial crisis, is not so clear cut. As Bloomberg News’s Lu Wang and Felice Maranz reported, at that time the financial industry’s earnings worsened for eight consecutive quarters, but analysts only expect profit declines to last half as long this time around. Banks are broadly considered to be well capitalized — certainly much more than they were 12 years ago when they had to be bailed out by the government. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon expressed confidence in mid-April, when the outlook was even more uncertain than today, that the biggest U.S. bank can handle “really adverse consequences.” He said on Tuesday that the U.S. could see a “fairly rapid recovery.”
“The government has been pretty responsive, large companies have the wherewithal, hopefully we’re keeping the small ones alive,” he said at a virtual conference hosted by Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB).
It’s far too soon to declare an “all clear” on the economy, but it’s starting to look as if actions from the Fed and Congress at least helped the U.S. clear the low bar of avoiding the worst-case scenario. The numbers are still awful, especially when it comes to unemployment, but data released Tuesday showed an unexpected increase in new-home sales in April compared with those a month earlier. Broadly,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C).’s economic surprise index is off its lows, indicating that recent figures aren’t quite as bad as analysts expected.
“The economic data have been so darn grim lately with job losses in the tens of millions that the green shoots of optimism from better consumer confidence and new home sales are welcome,” Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank NA, wrote on Tuesday. “We still can’t see a V-shaped recovery, but at least this is looking like the shortest recession in history which will be measured in months not years.”
If that’s the case, investors will likely look back on the past few weeks as a time when bank stocks became far too cheap compared with other parts of the market. Yet Tuesday’s seemingly huge rally still leaves financial companies worth far less than before the pandemic, and it seems reasonable to expect they’ll remain that way for a while. After all, it’s anyone’s guess just how many loans will end up going bad and saddle banks with losses. There are far more moving parts to JPMorgan’s bottom line than that of, say, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)., which fell 3% on Tuesday, the most in almost a month.
It’s never a good idea to read too much into one optimistic trading day, especially coming out of a U.S. holiday weekend in which many Americans probably got a taste of “normal” pre-pandemic activities. But on its face, Tuesday looks as if it could be something of a turning point for bank shares. The follow-through will indicate if they were just too cheap to pass up, or if the economy truly is on the mend.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 04:25PM ET</span>",Canada's Quebec provides $200 million aid to hard-hit Cirque du Soleil,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Cirque du Soleil, its spotlight dimmed by the coronavirus pandemic, will receive $200 million in aid from Canada's Quebec province, an official said on Tuesday, as part of broader efforts to revive and keep the hard-hit international entertainment group based in Montreal.
Quebec Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said the province has an agreement in principle that would give it the option to buy a majority stake in Cirque if shareholders TPG and Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd (HK:0656) decide to pull out. 
The heavily indebted Cirque was exploring bankruptcy protection in March and laid off almost all of its staff after social distancing due to the coronavirus pandemic forced it to cancel shows.
""The arrangement is that when the following shareholders, namely Fosun, the Chinese partner and TPG want to sell, we want the option to buy,"" Fitzgibbon told reporters in Quebec City.
""Of course at that point we’ll figure out if someone else wants to manage it. It's not the intent of the Minister of Economy to manage the Cirque du Soleil, I can assure you of that. At the same time, I want the control on who's going to buy. Because if you don’t have that clause, TPG or whoever else could sell to whomever.”
On Sunday, Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte told a French language TV network that he and a group of investors want to buy back into the circus company.

Cirque, which started as a ragtag group of street performers in Canada and grew into a global circus and entertainment colossus, sold a majority stake to the U.S. private equity fund TPG and its Chinese partner in 2015 in a $1.5 billion deal.

Investing.com – The Dow soared on Tuesday, though gains were kept in check by rising U.S.-China trade tensions amid a report that President Donald Trump is weighing up a range of sanctions on Beijing.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.17%, or 530 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.23%, cutting some gains to close below 3,000, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.17%.
In response to China's push to impose a security law in in Hong Kong that many believe threatens the autonomy of the city, the White House is considering a range of sanctions on Chinese official, businesses, and institutions, Bloomberg reported.
The news forced traders to rein in some of their bullish bets on stocks, which had rallied strongly on optimism over the reopening of the economy.
Financials led the charge higher for the broader market as investors piled into beaten-down bank stocks, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) up 7.10%, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) up 9% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) rising 9.25%.  
The surge in JPMorgan was also boosted by comments from CEO Jamie Dimon, who said the bank is ""very valuable"" at its current price.
Easing fears that reopening the economy could trigger a wave of infections also underpinned sentiment following data showing states that reopened before the start of May have seen a 29% reported drop in cases over the past three weeks, according to CNBC.
In another boost to reopening optimism, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that state, the epicentre of the outbreak, is ""decidedly in the reopening phase,"" with sports leagues, campgrounds and veterinarian offices set to reopen, albeit with limitations.
Efforts to reopen states nationwide has many expecting that domestic travel will pick and support battered airlines. 
UBS upgraded Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock to $41 from $37, sending its shares 12.6% higher. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was up 14.7% and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) jumped 16.3%.
Signs of progress on a potential vaccine also boosted investor sentiment, with  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) closing up 4.62% after the drugmaker said it had begun human trials for its potential coronavirus vaccine.
Merck (NYSE:MRK) climbed 1.14% after it said it had teamed up with scientific research company IAVI to develop a potential vaccine.
Energy, meanwhile, caught a bid on a sharp uptick in oil prices amid ongoing bets that output cuts by major producers and ongoing signs of a recovery in crude demand will alleviate the glut in supplies.
On the economic front, investors mulled mixed data as U.S. consumer confidence undershot expectations, but housing activity continued to rebound.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge rose to a reading of 86.6 in May from 85.7 the prior month, missing economists’ forecasts for a reading of 88. New home sales jumped to 623,000, topping economists' forecasts of 490,000."
1242,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 04:11PM ET</span>",Merck to buy Austrian vaccine maker as it jumps into COVID-19 race,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Michael Erman
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Merck & Co  Inc (N:MRK), which has largely kept to the sidelines of the race for COVID-19 treatments, said it was buying Austrian vaccine maker Themis Bioscience and would collaborate with research nonprofit IAVI to develop two separate vaccines.
It also announced a partnership with privately held Ridgeback Biotherapeutics to develop an experimental oral antiviral drug against COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Merck did not disclose the terms of the acquisition of Themis, a privately held company.
Most big pharmaceutical companies have already placed their bets on COVID-19 treatments. But Merck has been waiting for opportunities with proven track records, Chief Executive Ken Frazier said.
""We wanted to be in a position where we could choose things that have the right kind of characteristics to make a contribution for a virus that's likely to be with us for some time,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Both vaccines under development are designed to be delivered in a single dose.
The Themis vaccine, developed in collaboration with the Institut Pasteur in Paris, is based on a modified measles virus that delivers bits of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body to prevent COVID-19.
It was developed in part through funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).
Merck said it moving quickly with this candidate and expects to start vaccinating volunteers ""within weeks.""
The IAVI vaccine uses the same technology as Merck’s Ebola vaccine ERVEBO, recently approved by the European Commission and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.
That candidate, which Merck is developing jointly with IAVI, is expected to start human trials sometime this year, Frazier said.
The U.S. Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is backing the effort. 
Both vaccines are made using technologies that have resulted in licensed products, unlike some frontrunners, such as the rapidly developed vaccine from  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA), which is expected to start large, late-stage clinical trials in July.
More than 100 vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 are in development, with about 12 in human testing designed mainly to evaluate safety.
Last week, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said Merck's vaccine, and those from Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and Sanofi (PA:SASY), were a month or two behind Moderna's, but may be added to large efficacy trials this summer as they wrap up early-stage studies.
""I think we'll be in a position to participate,"" Frazier said of Merck's vaccines.
Merck intends to shoulder the cost of scaling up production of the vaccines before either has been proven to work, although it has not yet determined where they will be manufactured commercially, he said.
Doses of the Themis vaccine are already being made in France for clinical trials. Merck plans to begin early production of the vaccine it is developing with IAVI at its plant in Pennsylvania.
Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen said in a research note she expected Merck to be ""an important player in the COVID-19 vaccines and treatments landscape"" and called the approach to pursue multiple vaccine strategies ""a good means to diversify risk.""
Merck shares were up around 1.5% in late trading, as the broader U.S. stock market jumped.
Frazier said Merck had not signed any pacts with the U.S. government to deliver doses of either vaccine to Americans first, adding that it was committed to making its vaccines accessible globally and affordably. The drugmaker said it signed a memorandum of understanding with CEPI and Institut Pasteur outlining its commitment to a global vaccine that is distributed based on need.
Ridgeback's antiviral drug, EIDD-2801, is designed to block virus reproduction and has shown promise in animal studies of multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It has also been shown to be safe and well-tolerated in early stage trials. 
Frazier compared it to Gilead Sciences' (O:GILD) remdesivir, but it would be a pill, rather than an intravenous infusion. Efficacy trials will start later this year.
""If the drug works, we would be able to produce billions of doses,"" Frazier added.
The United States has recorded more than 1.6 million new coronavirus infections and over 97,000 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Unthinkable just two months ago as the world economy shut down in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. stock benchmark S&P 500 index broke through the psychologically-important 3,000 level on Tuesday, capping a 37% stock rally since its March low. 
But the market may be priced for an economic recovery that the data so far does not support, and some participants say the rally has gone too far, too fast.
It has been fueled by extraordinary interventions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, a $2 trillion stimulus passed by Congress, and hopes that the rapid development of a vaccine will mean that the worst of the damage from the global economic freeze has passed. 
""People have been locked up and when they see sparkles of hope like vaccines, that drives optimism probably ahead of where it should be and clearly ahead of the economy,"" said Richard Steinberg, chief market strategist at the Colony Group. 
Analysts cautioned that they do not expect the market to continue its rapid path upward. 
""I think we're going to give back a little bit soon as more political headlines emerge and people start thinking about problems with China, problems in Europe, problems everywhere the investor looks,"" said George Gero, managing director at RBC Wealth Management. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Chief Executive Christian Sewing said on Tuesday that markets were too optimistic.
""In my personal view, the underlying assumption for this recovery are a bit too optimistic,"" he said. ""Second- and third- order effects have not been fully priced in at this stage.""
The market spike has come against a devastating economic backdrop. The U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the most since the Great Depression. [nL1N2CP2KQ]
“It is pretty extraordinary,"" said Michael Purves, chief executive of Tallbacken Capital Advisors. ""It is a 'V' market with probably not a 'V' economic condition,"" he said, referring to the shape of the possible recovery.
Any developments that bring a vaccine closer to market will likely fuel additional gains even if economic data lag, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. 
""If things go well, we could have a vaccine by the first of the year,"" Cardillo said. ""It's a rally of hope."" 
BULLISH HERD 
It is being partly driven by five giants - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), Microsoft Inc (O:MSFT), Apple Inc (O:AAPL),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), and Google-parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) - make up approximately 20% of the weight of the S&P 500 index, pushing the broad market up as investors herd into companies that have seen increased demand during the economic freeze. 
Amazon, for instance, is up nearly 45% since its March low, while Facebook is up 62%. 
Some justify the gains by comparing the U.S. economy to China, which is about two months ahead in terms of both the virus outbreak and recovery. 
China's composite purchasing managers index fell by more than half in January, yet by April was above its reading at the beginning of the year. U.S. Composite PMI, meanwhile, began its steep drop in February and posted a nearly 35% gain in May, according to flash figures from Markit.
""Perhaps the revival within the U.S. will not be as quick nor as dramatic as it has reportedly been in China,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. ""But the economic pattern exhibited by the U.S. economy, thus far, is similar (with a lag) to the experience of China.""
Investors are looking for light at the end of the tunnel. 
New York was long the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak but Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday that Memorial Day, which fell on Monday, would show ""we turned the page on COVID-19"" and refocused on reopening. 

In a sign of survival of the financial heart of the city, the New York Stock Exchange partially reopened its trading floor.

Investing.com - Wall Street soared on Tuesday as ongoing efforts to reopen states nationwide and hopes for a Covid-19 vaccine boosted investor sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.66%, or 651 points, the S&P 500 gained 1.83% to rise above 3,000 for the first time since Mar. 5, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.77%.
The race for a potential vaccine continues to heat up, with  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) rallying about 5% after the drugmaker said it had begun human trials for its potential coronavirus vaccine.
Merck (NYSE:MRK) climbed 1.6% after it said it had teamed up with scientific research company IAVI to develop a potential vaccine.
Easing fears that reopening the economy could trigger a wave of infections also supported sentiment following data showing states that reopened before the start of May have seen a 29% reported drop in cases over the past three weeks, according to CNBC.
In another boost to reopening optimism, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday that state, the epicentre of the outbreak, is ""decidedly in the reopening phase,"" with sports leagues, campgrounds and veterinarian offices set to reopen, albeit with limitations.
Efforts to reopen states nationwide has many expecting that domestic travel will pick and support battered airlines. 
UBS upgraded Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) to buy from neutral and raised its price target on the stock to $41 from $37, sending its shares 12% higher. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was up 12% and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) jumped 15%.
Financials led the charge higher for the broader market as investors piled into beaten-down bank stocks, with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) up about 8% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) rising10%.  
Energy, meanwhile, caught a bid on a sharp uptick in oil prices amid ongoing bets that output cuts by major producers and ongoing signs of a recovery in crude demand will alleviate the glut in supplies.
On the economic front, investors mulled mixed data as U.S. consumer confidence undershot expectations, but housing activity continued to rebound.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge rose to a reading of 86.6 in May from 85.7 the prior month, missing economists’ forecasts for a reading of 88. New home sales jumped to 623,000, topping economists' forecasts of 490,000."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian labor prosecutors are suing meatpacker JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) seeking damages and better work conditions after an outbreak of the novel coronavirus at a meat plant in Ipumirim, in the southern state of Santa Catarina, according to a prosecutors' statement on Wednesday.
This is the second time in just over a month labor prosecutors have sought legal action against the meatpacker over its alleged inability to stem outbreaks of the novel coronavirus at meat production sites.
JBS said in a statement sent to Reuters that it had not received formal notice of the lawsuit and added, without elaborating, that it adhered to ""strict protocols"" against the virus.
In Rio Grande do Sul state, labor prosecutors on April 18 also filed suit after a high number of COVID-19 cases were detected at the company's Passo Fundo unit. Operations at Passo Fundo, which employs more than 2,600 people and like Ipumirim slaughters chickens, resumed on May 21 after being closed for about a month.
The prosecutors in Santa Catarina alleged JBS is not doing enough to protect its employees at Ipumirim, which was closed after a labor inspection on May 18.
""The company is considered a contagion hot spot for coronavirus not only in Ipumirim, but also in neighboring municipalities, as it employs workers from all over the region,"" a statement by labor prosecutors said.
On the day prosecutors closed Ipumirim, some 86 employees had tested positive for COVID-19, or about 5% of the approximately 1,500 employees at the site, the prosecutors' statement said.

The cases registered at the plant represented then approximately 14% of the contaminations in the west of Santa Catarina, and almost 2% of all cases in the state, the prosecutors said.

1248,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>","Armed with whistleblower tips, U.S. SEC cracks down on coronavirus misconduct","By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The novel coronavirus outbreak and economic fallout is proving to be a bonanza for whistleblower lawyers as the U.S. securities regulator cracks down on a range of related misconduct from companies touting sham cures to misuse of federal aid. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fielded about 4,000 complaints from mid-March to mid-May, a 35% increase on the year-ago period, Steven Peikin, the agency's co-head of enforcement, said this month as cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, shot up.
That is creating work for lawyers who help whistleblowers navigate the SEC's bounty program for tipsters whose information leads to penalties of more than $1 million for offenders. The agency is already working with some tipsters, lawyers said.
""Unfortunately, fraudsters often seek to exploit difficult situations like the ongoing pandemic for their own gain. The SEC frequently relies on the tips that we receive from the public,"" an SEC spokeswoman said.
Two factors appear to be driving the current surge in tips, according to lawyers: the sheer scale of the crisis has sparked a wave of misconduct across all areas of the SEC's remit, and mass unemployment has unleashed whistleblowers who may otherwise have feared retaliation by their employers.
Neil Getnick, managing partner of Getnick & Getnick, said his practice had seen a jump in whistleblower complaints.
""I expect that is just the beginning. Typically about six months in we'll see that matters will begin to crystallize, and at that point I would expect an uptick in enforcement cases,"" he said.
Getnick said a broad range of misconduct related to the COVID-19 outbreak, such as loan fraud, price-gouging, counterfeit or substandard medical goods, or healthcare fraud, could potentially find their way into the SEC's remit, due to the breadth of U.S. securities law. 
""Anything that in effect interferes with the free market operating freely, will potentially give rise to SEC liability."" 
The agency has created a new group to closely monitor the market and spot potential abuses. So far, that effort has led it to suspend trading in 31 so-called penny stocks for allegedly touting dubious COVID-19 cures, tests, treatments and medical supplies to investors. 
The SEC this month charged two of those companies, Applied BioSciences Corp and Turbo Global Partners (NYSE:GLP) Inc, for allegedly publishing misleading information on the status of their COVID-19 screening offerings. The companies did not respond to multiple emails and calls for comment.
EAGER TIPSTERS
The SEC has also begun scrutinizing companies which took emergency aid for potential disclosure issues. Lawyers also expect to see it bring charges against coronavirus-related insider trading, Ponzi schemes and ""boiler room"" stock scams.
""We expect to see the SEC bring more actions as we continue to investigate suspected COVID-19 related scams,"" Peikin and his enforcement co-head, Stephanie Avakian, said in a statement.
Stephen Kohn, a partner at Kohn, Kohn and Colapinto, said his firm has seen ""a slew of coronavirus-related tips."" The SEC has heard from investors about scams related to a large number of small private companies as well as larger, listed ""essential"" firms like meat-packing houses, he said. 
He added that many tipsters have been recently laid off and are eager to help identify issues that have surfaced at their previous employers without fear of reprisals.
With so many tips, lawyers are being selective about which cases they take on. Sean McKessy, a partner at Phillips & Cohen who previously worked to set up the SEC whistleblower office, said he was on the lookout for misconduct the SEC tends to penalize most harshly, such as companies padding earnings or disclosure violations. 

""While the SEC has so far penalized penny stock firms, the regulator is also quite vigilant about what larger companies are telling investors about how COVID-19 might impact them,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that he expects the bank will boost its credit reserves again in the second quarter by an amount ""roughly equivalent"" to the $7 billion it added in the first quarter to protect the bank from a potential wave of loan defaults.
Dimon said that it was still early, but he expects most banks will add to cash reserves because economists now estimate the U.S. unemployment rate will rise to 18% by June 30, as businesses cannot yet rehire workers let go during the economic shutdown caused by the novel coronavirus. 
""Since CECL is very forward looking, I think that banks will have to put up a lot more credit reserves this quarter,"" Dimon said, referring a new accounting rule that requires banks to take provisions now for loans a borrower may default on at any point. ""We would have a substantial increase in credit reserves in the second quarter.""
JPMorgan's first-quarter profits plunged by roughly two-thirds because it put aside $7 billion in reserves for outstanding loans to customers. https://reut.rs/2XBtsBO
Speaking at a virtual conference hosted by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Dimon said that these builds in the bank's credit reserve coffers are front-loaded and will likely taper off in the third and fourth quarters, when economists also expect the U.S. unemployment rate to fall closer to 10%.
Despite that, Dimon said there are signs the economy is regaining its footing. Customers of the largest U.S. bank are spending more on their debit cards again, bringing 2020's total spending levels back in line with that of 2019, Dimon said. 
Revenues from the bank's trading division also remain strong, similar to levels seen in March and April when JPMorgan handled record-high volumes, Dimon said.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday promised a swift review of data on hydroxychloroquine, probably by mid-June, after safety concerns prompted the group to suspend the malaria drug's use in a large trial on COVID-19 patients.
U.S. President Donald Trump and others have pushed hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment, but the WHO on Monday called time after the British journal The Lancet reported patients getting hydroxychloroquine had increased death rates and irregular heartbeats.
""A final decision on the harm, benefit or lack of benefit of hydroxychloroquine will be made once the evidence has been reviewed,"" the body said. ""It is expected by mid-June.""
Those already in a 17-country study, called Solidarity, of thousands of patients who have started hydroxychloroquine can finish their treatment, the WHO said.
Newly enrolled patients will get other treatments being evaluated, including Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD) Science's remdesivir and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)'s Kaletra/Aluvia.
Separate hydroxychloroquine trials, including a 440-patient U.S. study by Swiss drugmaker Novartis, are continuing enrollment. 
Novartis and rival Sanofi (PA:SASY) have pledged donations of tens of millions of doses of the drug, also used in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, for COVID-19.
Novartis said The Lancet study, while covering 100,000 people, was ""observational"" and could not demonstrate a causal link between hydroxychloroquine and side effects. 
""We need randomised, controlled clinical trials to clearly understand efficacy and safety,"" a Novartis spokesman said. 
The WHO said its safety-board review would examine not just Solidarity patients, but other hydroxychloroquine studies too, to determine if a pattern emerges similar to problems described in The Lancet. 
Dr. Oriol Manuel, infectious disease expert and national coordinator of the Solidarity study in Switzerland, said hitting pause now made sense.

""There are several thousand patients already enrolled, some randomised to receive hydroxychloroquine, some who did not receive any drug,"" Manuel told Reuters. ""They can do a comparison of the use of hydroxychloroquine ... to see whether there is a signal of some kind of adverse events.""

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to reopen about 100 U.S. stores, mostly with curbside pickup but some with walk-in service, the company said on Tuesday.
Apple shuttered stores worldwide as the novel coronavirus pandemic spread but has slowly opened them based on local health data. Earlier this month, the company reopened a handful of stores in Alaska, Idaho and Alabama.
Under Apple's new procedures, stores with walk-in service will require customers and employees to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering. Apple will provide masks to customers who have none. Social-distancing rules will limit the number of people in the store at one time, which Apple said could create delays for walk-in customers.
Apple plans to allow customers to handle display products, as before.
""Throughout the day, we're conducting enhanced deep cleanings that place special emphasis on all surfaces, display products, and highly trafficked areas,"" Apple retail chief Deirdre O'Brien wrote in a letter to customers.
Apple has stores in several states where local rules would have allowed it to open, but it did not immediately do so. The company has relied on local data down to the city level, sometimes even reopening in the same U.S. state at different times.

The company started shuttering its China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March. Days later, Apple closed all stores outside mainland China as the virus moved around the globe. Stores reopened outside the Greater China region in mid-April, starting in South Korea, and have continued through Europe, Asia and the United States.

BOSTON (Reuters) -  Northern Trust  Corp's decision to liquidate a $1.8-billion prime money market fund was seen as an outlier event by industry analysts on Wednesday, but one that could portend more problems depending on how the economy fares.
Money has rushed back into prime funds since the sector suffered major withdrawals in March, according to figures from researcher Peter Crane. Total prime fund assets stand at $1.1 trillion, with less than $1 billion of net customer withdrawals for the year to date.
One fund that has not seemed to benefit from the comeback is Northern Trust's (O:NTRS) Prime Obligations Fund  which recently had close to $4 billion in assets.
In filings on Monday, the company said its fund board determined to liquidate and terminate Prime Obligations around July 10, and return money to shareholders, with the action being in their ""best interests.""
The fund's manager in March had disclosed its liquidity level dipped temporarily.[nL1N2BG19H] Asked about the liquidation, Northern Trust spokesman Doug Holt said ""this decision was specific"" to the fund. 
Prime funds own a range of government, bank and commercial instruments. Other firms have injected cash into their prime funds or closed them to new investors, and the sector has received Federal Reserve support. [nFWN2C414W] 
Crane said Northern Trust's actions seem unique given the fund's small scale and the broader industry comeback. A bigger issue could be low interest rates that lead firms to waive fees, he said. 
Analyst Brian Reynolds of Reynolds Strategy LLC said more funds could liquidate if efforts to stimulate the economy don't succeed.

""The risk over the rest of the year is that more funds start to see redemptions as clients burn through cash that they just borrowed,"" he said.

Finance minister Rishi Sunak is due to announce later this week how much employers will need to contribute to the furlough scheme from August, and is also expected to set new rules on part-time working, which is currently not allowed.
To avoid employers furloughing extra staff and bringing them back part-time, with a government-subsidised wage, the finance ministry is likely to announce that scheme will stop accepting more people, the FT said, citing ""allies of the chancellor"".
Currently the British government pays 80% of the salary, up to 2,500 pounds ($3,083) a month, of almost any private-sector employee who is put on temporary leave due to the coronavirus.

(Reuters) - LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM), the continent's largest carrier, filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection on Tuesday, becoming the world's largest carrier so far to seek an emergency reorganization due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
The filing highlights the financial weakness of Latin America's carriers, following a similar bankruptcy earlier this month by the region's No. 2 airline Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p). 
But unlike Avianca, which experienced management turmoil and losses, Chile's LATAM posted profits for the last four consecutive years totaling more than $700 million. LATAM had also approved a dividend payment this year, in contrast to other carriers that have halted payouts.
One of the world's largest airlines, LATAM said it would continue to fly through its bankruptcy restructuring. 
LATAM shares sank 51% in Santiago, while ADRs remained suspended in U.S. trading.
Latin American governments, many under severe budget constraints themselves, have been reluctant to bail out their key airlines, in contrast to the United States and Europe. 
Most recently, Germany bailed out Lufthansa for a 20% stake.
Chile's Economy Minister Lucas Palacios said on Tuesday he would not rule out a bailout, although he did not propose one. 
""Lufthansa's case is completely different,"" Palacios said. ""LATAM is an international airline, its shares trade in the United States."" 
In a separate statement, Chile's finance ministry said LATAM is a ""strategic company for Chile"" and that the government would ""consider"" how it could contribute to LATAM's restructuring.
In Brazil, LATAM has been negotiating a bailout of up to 2 billion reais ($367.45 million) that has yet to materialize. 
LATAM's Brazil unit is not part of the bankruptcy, and the company said it might file for bankruptcy there as well if the negotiations for aid fall through. 
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) last year paid $1.9 billion for a 20% stake in LATAM during rosier times for the air travel industry, becoming the No. 2 shareholder in the company.
A plan to coordinate flight routes between Latin America and the United States remains in place, the airlines said. If anything, LATAM said its bankruptcy filing would seek to expedite the timeline for the necessary antitrust approvals to do so. 
In the lead-up to the bankruptcy filing, LATAM laid off 1,800 employees out of over 40,000 in total. 
""This path represents the best option,"" Chief Executive Roberto Alvo said in a statement regarding bankruptcy.
TROUBLED MERGER
LATAM is an instantly recognizable brand for South Americans, dominating international air travel in the region, as well as a leading domestic flight operator in Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Peru and Ecuador. 
In addition to Brazil, subsidiaries in Argentina and Paraguay are also not part of the bankruptcy process. 
LATAM said it raised up to $900 million to support operations through its bankruptcy reorganization from major shareholders, including the Cueto family which controls the airline and Qatar Airways.
In addition, LATAM has $1.3 billion in cash on hand. 
LATAM was born in 2012 through a merger between Chile's LAN and Brazil's TAM, spawning a carrier with large aircraft order books and major exposure to Latin America's top economy as it went through its worst recession on record. 
It has since dropped many plane orders but maintains 44 with Airbus (PA:AIR) and 7 with  Boeing Co  (N:BA). LATAM said it would seek to cancel several of those orders. 
LATAM did disclose that Delta canceled the planned purchase of four Airbus A350s from LATAM, and paid $62 million to break the deal. 
LATAM said that as of Tuesday, it had $7.6 billion in debt, including $460 million in loans tied to its Brazilian subsidiary. 
The airline was downgraded by S&P and Fitch on Friday after not paying interest and principal on $1 billion worth of debt tied to new aircraft purchases.
Investment bank  Moelis & Co  (N:MC) is in talks to represent bondholders owning around $3 billion in debt owed by LATAM, a source told Reuters.

The company paid President and Chief Executive Officer Paul Stone $700,000, and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Jamere Jackson $600,000 as retention bonuses, Hertz said in a filing to the U.S. regulators.
Last week, the board of the company, which counts billionaire investor Carl Icahn as its largest shareholder with a nearly 39% stake, allowed it to seek chapter 11 protection in a U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware.
The firm is reeling under travel bans and lockdowns imposed to curb the spread of the new coronavirus. Since the virus outbreak, a large portion of Hertz's revenue, which comes from car rentals at airports, have evaporated. 
With nearly $19 billion of debt and roughly 38,000 employees worldwide as of the end of 2019, Hertz is among the largest companies to be undone by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Employees who received the retention bonus would forfeit the right to participate in the company's 2020 annual bonus plan.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped and the S&P 500 breached 3,000 points on Tuesday as optimism about a potential coronavirus vaccine and a revival in business activity helped investors overlook simmering Sino-U.S. tensions.
The benchmark index traded above the key psychological level for the first time since March 5, but came off session highs as White House adviser Larry Kudlow said President Donald Trump was ""so miffed with China on virus and other matters that the trade deal is not as important to him as it once was"".
Still, all 11 S&P sector indexes were trading higher, with cyclical financials (SPSY), industrials (SPLRCI) and energy <.SPNU> stocks jumping between 3.5% and 5%.
The S&P 500 has risen about 37% from its March lows on a raft of central bank and government stimulus and is now just about 11% below its February record high.
On Monday, California decided to reopen in-store retail businesses and places of worship from one of the most restrictive shutdowns in the United States.
""People have been locked up and when they see sparkles of hope like vaccines, that drives optimism probably ahead of where it should be and clearly ahead of the economy,"" said Richard Steinberg, chief market strategist at Colony Group in Florida.
Data showed U.S. consumer confidence nudged up in May, adding to hopes the worst of the impact of the shutdown in economic activity was probably in the past.
At 11:41 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 605.49 points, or 2.47%, at 25,070.65, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 50.32 points, or 1.70%, at 3,005.77, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 66.52 points, or 0.71%, at 9,391.11.
U.S. biotech group  Novavax  Inc (O:NVAX) jumped 14.7% as it joined the race to test coronavirus vaccine candidates on humans and enrolled its first participants.  Merck & Co  Inc (N:MRK) added 2.3% as it announced plans to develop two separate vaccines.
But with U.S. unemployment soaring beyond 14% and macroeconomic data pointing at a deep recession, analysts warned financial markets could be betting on too fast a recovery.
""The impact on the economy and corporate earnings will be seen for several quarters (and) I'm not sure if it has been completely baked into the equity prices,"" Robert Wyrick, chief investment officer at Post Oak Private Wealth Advisors in Houston, Texas told the Reuters Global Markets Forum.
Beaten down travel-related stocks soared, with S&P 1500 airlines index <.SPCOMAIR> up 10.8% and cruise operators including Carnival Corp (N:CCL) more than 12.3%.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners more than 6-to-1 on the NYSE and 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.
The S&P index recorded 13 new 52-week highs and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 96 new highs and seven new lows.

1269,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Global airlines body raises alarm over bailout debts,"PARIS (Reuters) - Heavy debts inherited from government bailouts and other fund-raising moves will delay the airline industry's recovery from the coronavirus crisis, a trade body said on Tuesday.
Global airline debts are set to rise by more than a quarter to $550 billion by the end of the year after governments announced $123 billion in total support, the International Air Transport Association said.
That includes $67 billion of liabilities that must be repaid and $11.5 billion in equity financing.
On top of the $123 billion from taxpayers, another $52 billion comes from commercial sources such as bank loans.
With the amount of new equity raised dwarfed by debt the airlines have taken on, their balance sheets will on average be weaker when they emerge from the crisis.
That means the industry's woes will last longer than the time it takes for passenger demand to recover, IATA said.
""The treatment is creating a problem with the patient which will need to be dealt with once we get into the recovery period,"" Chief Economist Brian Pearce told reporters.
""If we don't see any improvement in the restart period, we are certainly fearful that we are going to see a number of failures."" 
The warning came as Chile's LATAM (SN:LTM) filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection.
IATA data showed the lion's share of bailouts came in the United States and western Europe, where Germany has agreed a 9-billion-euro package for Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).
""Airlines particularly in Latin America need strong government support,"" de Juniac told a news conference.
IATA meanwhile urged governments to keep politics out of border controls after Britain and France became embroiled in a row over quarantine rules.
France has signalled it will impose equivalent measures after Britain announced a 14-day quarantine for people arriving from mainland Europe.
De Juniac said border restrictions related to the epidemic should be driven by science.
""Tit-for-tat quarantine measures are unacceptable,"" he said, adding IATA would not comment on individual states.

UK airlines have said the quarantine would be devastating for the airline sector. Britain says the measure is needed to slow the spread of disease.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) is hoping for a quick nod from the European Commission for its 9 billion euro ($9.8 billion) bailout agreed on Monday to make sure the cash arrives in time for the company to stay afloat.
""This should be a matter of days"", one of the people said.
Lufthansa's supervisory board is expected to meet Wednesday to sign off on the rescue deal and the invitation for an extraordinary shareholder meeting is expected shortly thereafter, the sources said. 
Lufthansa's owners need to agree to the bailout, which includes Germany taking a 20% stake in the carrier and the injection of 5.7 billion euros in non-voting capital. The vote is not expected to take place unless the EU has signed off on the rescue deal.
The European Commission has asked Lufthansa to waive landing rights for 6 out of 300 planes altogether at Frankfurt and Munich airports, where Lufthansa has a two-thirds market share.
The number of planes and corresponding numbers of airport slots can differ as planes on short-haul flights may have 5-6 slots a day compared to just one for planes on long-haul. 
Lufthansa's total fleet comprises 760 aircraft, although Chief Executive Carsten Spohr has said that 100 will remain grounded due to lower demand following the COVID-19 pandemic.
NordLB analyst Wolfgang Donie said giving up slots amounting to 3 planes per hub would be manageable.
The airport slots could then be given to rival airlines, increasing competition, which the EU does not want to see compromised by state bailouts. 
""State aid rule do allow to support the aviation sector while ensuring that competition and consumers are not at a disadvantage"", a spokeswoman of the European Commission said, declining to comment on details of the Lufthansa case.
Lufthansa called for fair treatment compared with other bailed-out peers and also declined to comment on specifics. 
In a sign that rivals do see Lufthansa getting an unfair advantage, Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary spoke out on Tuesday. 
""Ryanair will appeal against this latest example of illegal state aid to Lufthansa, which will massively distort competition,"" he said in a statement.
Lufthansa had after weeks of negotiations agreed a deal with Berlin to help it to cope with what is expected to be a protracted travel slump.

German chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany would fight for remedies not being too stringent, German media reported.

Last week, Uber said it would focus on its core businesses in ride-hailing and food delivery and cut staffing globally in an attempt to become profitable despite the coronavirus pandemic.
""The impact of Covid-19 and the unpredictable nature of the recovery has left Uber India SA with no choice but to reduce the size of its workforce,"" Uber India and South Asia President Pradeep Parameswaran said.
Laid off employees will receive a minimum of 10 weeks worth of payout, medical insurance coverage for the next six months and other help, Parameswaran added.
The ride-hailing taxi business in India came to a halt in late March as the government enforced a countrywide lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. The lockdown has since been eased, but companies across sectors face challenges as demand for their services has dropped.
Uber's main rival in India - SoftBank Group-backed Ola - said last week it would cut about 1,400 jobs as the lockdown brought down revenue by 95% in the last couple of months.

Uber did not say how many workers it employs in India, but a source told Reuters the company employed around 2,400-2,500 employees before Tuesday's job cuts were announced.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets surged at opening on Tuesday as the official arrival of summer in the shape of the Memorial Day weekend appeared to have awakened the optimist in everyone on Wall Street.
Rising hopes that the pharma sector will produce a vaccine against the Coronavirus before the year-end, coupled with the sight of pent-up demand being unleashed at beaches and parks across the country over the weekend, pushed major indices to their highest in over two months. 
By 10 AM ET (1000 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 591 points, or 2.4%,at 25,050 points, its highest since early March, while the S&P 500 was up 2.1%, breaking through the 3,000 barrier, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4%.
Sentiment was supported by the latest news from the hunt for a vaccine to treat the Coronavirus, something that is widely seen as a necessary precondition for consumers to return to pre-pandemic levels of activity with confidence. 
On Friday, the nation's top doctor Anthony Fauci had told NPR that his timeline for having a virus ready to distribute within 12 months of the outbreak's beginning was still intact.
 Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock rose 12.5% to a new record high after announcing the start of human testing of its experimental vaccine in Australia. In contract to the drugs being developed by the likes of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Novavax's is based on technology that has already been proven in other antiviral drugs. Novavax has tripled in the last three weeks as its testing process has moved forward.

Analysts are looking with increasing favor on beaten-down cyclicals, amid signs of a rebound in May business surveys.
""If forward-looking data continues to improve, then cyclical stocks might finally begin to outpace defensives, following a highly unusual two-month rally in which defensive stocks were usually the leaders,"" said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist with  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), said in a weekly video briefing.

1299,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Brazil stocks to slog through worst year since 2008 as pandemic strikes,"By Gabriel Burin and Abraham Gonzalez
BUENOS AIRES/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks will keep slogging through a year that is shaping up as their worst since the global financial crisis of 2008 due to concerns over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on local companies, a Reuters survey showed.
In the most likely scenario, the benchmark Bovespa stock index (BVSP) would close this year 22.4% lower than at the end of 2019, further scarring Latin America's No.1 economy, already hit by a recession of historic proportions.
Only three months ago, Brazilian stocks were expected to rise 16.7% in 2020. The Bovespa is down 25.9% so far in the year, on its way to ending a four-year rally that was supported lately by President Jair Bolsonaro's reform plans. 
The index is forecast to finish 2020 at 89,700 points, according to the median estimate of 14 strategists and analysts polled May 12-26. Forecasts from 74,792 to 100,000 points implied potential annual losses in the range of 13.5%-35.2%.
The median view would deliver a gain of 4.7% on local equities compared to Monday's closing values, which were still weak even after the index climbed 34.7% from a nearly three-year low in March at the apex of the virus panic.
""With the economy re-opening, the Bovespa can follow a global upward movement but the rise will be mitigated by local political risk,"" said Ilan Arbetman, an equity research analyst from Ativa Investimentos in Río de Janeiro.
Brazilian stocks have lagged Wall Street's turnaround, fueled by hopes of a quick normalization in U.S. activity. Investors in Brazilian assets remain on edge in the face of persistent turmoil within the government over policy.
The country lost its second health minister in a month after Bolsonaro demanded wider use of unproven anti-malarial drugs to fight the coronavirus in one of the pandemic's worst global hotspots.
Corporate balance sheets have yet to reflect the full impact of quarantine steps adopted mostly in April. 
""It will be tough for companies before recovery signs begin appearing in the third quarter,"" said Arbetman.
Separately, Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC index (MXX) is forecast to close 2020 down about 8% at 40,000 points, in contrast with expectations for gains of more than 10% in a February poll. Risks for Mexican stocks are skewed to the downside. 
""We might see some pressure on corporate results for the second quarter. And after that, an increase in volatility due to the U.S. presidential campaign,"" said Juan Rich, stocks strategy director at Ve por Más in Mexico City.
A growing rift between the government and local business leaders is another source of concern. Last week, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador slammed criticism of new rules giving the state more control in the energy sector.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kentucky Fried Chicken on Tuesday will begin testing an overhauled sandwich featuring a bigger chicken filet and other modifications that could reignite last year's Great Chicken Sandwich Wars with rivals Popeyes and Chick-fil-A.
KFC, a unit of  Yum! Brands Inc  (N:YUM), will sell the new version of its chicken sandwich for 26 days - or until supplies run out - at 15 locations in and around Orlando, Florida for $3.99. 
The larger chicken filet will come on a brioche bun with thick pickle slices and mayonnaise. That appears to be similar to traits that have made rivals' sandwiches such a hit with customers.
""We realized that our sandwich wasn't the one to beat and that wasn't okay for us,"" Andrea Zahumensky, KFC's chief marketing officer in the United States, told Reuters.
Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, a unit of Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR), introduced a chicken sandwich and social media campaign in August 2019 that launched a war with the dominant chicken brand by market share, privately owned Chick-fil-A.
U.S. same-store sales for Popeyes soared and remained high, up 29% in the first quarter of 2020. KFC sales for the same period dropped 8%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. 
Popeyes this month launched its first store in China – in Shanghai – to huge crowds.
Even burger-centric McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) began testing a chicken sandwich by December on the urging of franchisees eager to tap into the trend.
KFC began reworking its existing chicken sandwich in the middle of 2019, Zahumensky said, testing pickles with different thicknesses and brines and working with six different bakeries to try at least 10 variations of buns. 
KFC made another move last year, with a trial of a plant-based fried chicken product that sold out within about five hours, Zahumensky said. [nL3N25M31C] [nL1N29Y0W6]

""It was a great year for fried chicken,"" Zahumensky said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange will partially reopen the trading floors at its iconic 11 Wall Street building on Tuesday for the first time since March 20 when the bourse was forced to go all-electronic due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Intercontinental Exchange Inc's (N:ICE) NYSE floor will be different, with protective masks, strict social distancing requirements, and just around a quarter of the people, NYSE Chief Commercial Officer John Tuttle said in an interview. Still, he says the reopening is meaningful. 
""The floor represents so much more than the several tens-of-thousands of square feet it occupies,"" he said. ""It's a symbol of America, and it's a symbol of capital markets; it's a symbol of the economy and after two months of the country and essentially the world being offline, we want to lead from the front.""
The NYSE said most of its designated market makers, who oversee trading in the exchange's 2,200 listed companies, will continue to work from home, as will most exchange employees. 
The 100 or so traders, regulatory, and operational staff heading into the building, in a still-largely deserted lower Manhattan, have been asked to avoid public transportation, and everyone entering will be screened for signs of the virus.
The NYSE floor is the last physical U.S. stock trading venue, as a slew of all-electronic competitors have emerged and eaten away at the Big Board's once dominant market share.
Since the move to electronic-only trading, there have been no major disruptions, even with record volumes and volatility, prompting rivals to say the floor, where stocks have changed hands since 1792, has no real utility.

The NYSE says recent data show there was less volatility and tighter bid-ask spreads for NYSE-listed stocks when floor brokers were present, translating into millions of dollars a day in savings for investors.

Swiss watch exports plunged the most in at least two decades as the coronavirus pandemic led to factory closures, shuttered shops and travel bans.
Shipments plunged 81% to 328.8 million francs ($310 million) in April, according to the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry. That’s the biggest drop in at least two decades.
Swiss watchmakers are already bracing for the worst year in the modern history of watchmaking as the coronavirus outbreak led to a virtual standstill of production and shuttered stores. Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert on May 15 warned of “grave economic consequences” that could last three years.
“Trends are unlikely to improve materially until the back half of the year,” Thomas Chauvet, an analyst at Citi, wrote in a note to clients.
China was the best-performing market with a drop of 16%, accounting for a third of Swiss watch exports. Most other countries saw exports decline by more than 60%.

1306,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 26, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>","As Uber Drivers Hope for Unemployment or U.S. Loans, a Lucky Few Get Both","(Bloomberg) --
Ron Parise has spent about 50 hours a week for the last two years on the roads of Cape Coral, Florida, shuttling tourists and snowbirds between their rentals and the airport for Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). All that came to a sudden stop in late March, when the arrivals gates went quiet and Parise’s wife insisted he stay home to avoid exposing himself to the coronavirus.
Parise, 73, used his newfound free time to apply for any public assistance program for which he thought he might qualify. Nothing came through until early this month, when he received $11,500. It’s a small-business loan forgivable under certain conditions, part of the $659 billion Paycheck Protection Program, which is designed to encourage companies to keep paying employees during the pandemic. Parise believes he qualifies because he owns a one-man business to support his job driving.
The state of Florida initially told Parise he wasn’t eligible for unemployment insurance, but he recently began receiving checks under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which gives relief to independent contractors who have been impacted by the pandemic.  
This created an ethical dilemma for Parise, and perhaps a legal one, too. The small-business money is supposed to keep bosses like Parise from laying off workers— in this case, just Parise. Unemployment benefits are intended for people who have lost their jobs. “I don’t want to seem like I’m double dipping,” he said. “I’m happy to stay home and collect the government money if I can.” Parise said he hasn’t decided what to do but is leaning toward taking taking both and paying back the loan before it comes due in two years.
While Uber considers its drivers to be independent contractors, some like Parise set up small businesses to manage their income from driving. The designation helps minimize personal and tax liabilities and for Parise, validates his status as an entrepreneur in his own right. “I’m more of an independent business person,” he said. “I hire Uber to send me customers.”
Deciphering the rules around the government’s financial-assistance programs is a widespread challenge, and ride-hailing drivers face a particularly complicated route. The pandemic has left most of them unable to find enough work to get by. Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft haven’t altered their stance that drivers are independent contractors, not employees, disqualifying them from unemployment insurance in most states. The companies have directed drivers toward at least three alternatives, including the two Parise applied for.
Congress created Pandemic Unemployment Assistance to help provide financial relief to workers normally ineligible for unemployment benefits, and Uber successfully lobbied for its drivers to be included. States manage the federally funded program, and implementation has been patchy at best. Many drivers have yet to receive money or even confirmation they’ll get it eventually, said Harry Campbell, who runs a popular website for drivers called the Rideshare Guy. “Some people are getting unemployment,” he said. “Some aren’t.”
The financial-aid programs for small businesses have been similarly inconsistent. Tied up in the practical questions of where drivers can turn for help is an unresolved fight over whether Uber and Lyft’s workers should be considered employees of the companies. Many drivers, along with labor groups and Democratic public officials, have said the companies are cheating drivers out of benefits and offloading the costs onto taxpayers. “They are using the moment to crystallize the fact that, in their view, these workers should not have the benefit of employee status,” said Brian Chen, a staff attorney at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. 
Ride-hailing companies oppose efforts by drivers to access traditional unemployment benefits from states, which are financed through payroll taxes. Uber and Lyft are contesting a California law intended to classify workers like their drivers as employees, and the state recently sued them in response. Most drivers, said Chen, would receive more generous benefits from state programs, an assertion Uber contests. “Congress fully funded pandemic unemployment assistance for gig workers so that every state, many of which face historic deficits, could give these workers immediate financial support at no cost to their own state funds,” said Harry Hartfield, a spokesman for Uber.
Lyft and Uber would have been on the hook for $413 million in unemployment insurance costs over the last five years in California alone, according to a study published this month by the University of California, Berkeley’s Institute for Research and Labor. A similar analysis by officials in New Jersey said Uber would have faced a bill of $530 million for unemployment and disability from 2014 to 2018. Tally up the 48 other states, and you’re looking at a significant additional cost for two companies that have never been profitable.
“I don’t want to seem like I’m double dipping”
New York courts have ruled multiple times in favor of Uber drivers seeking unemployment benefits in the last year, but only after a lengthy process that’s onerous for both applicants and the state, said Nicole Salk, a senior staff attorney with Legal Services NYC who has represented several drivers in such cases. “It causes problems for the whole system.” she said.
Amara Sanogo, a driver in the Bronx, is living off his credit cards and helping his three children with their Zoom video curriculum as he waits for a response from the state about whether he qualifies for benefits. When he applied nearly two months ago, Sanogo set up an online account on a state website and was told he’d get updates there. “Every day I check that account,” he said. “There are no more messages.” New York’s Labor Department is now advising gig economy workers to apply to the federal program instead of the state’s.
For drivers who set up a business to manage their Uber income, there are signs of significant interest in the small-business programs. Ron Walter, a driver in the Denver area who primarily works for Uber and Grubhub Inc., wrote a blog post about his experience applying for a PPP loan, which companies don’t need to pay back as long as they keep paying employees and adhere to other guidelines. Walter’s blog post contained a link encouraging other drivers to apply through a website called Womply.com, which charges lenders a commission for sending them leads. Dozens of drivers clicked through the link and filled out applications, according to data Walter received from Womply that was reviewed by Bloomberg.
Walter got a loan of $4,800 and anticipates he’ll have to pay it back. He didn’t apply for other government programs, he said, because it didn’t feel right. Since Walter mostly delivers food, he said he’s actually doing pretty well. He can squeeze more deliveries into every hour and gets paid more. “Traffic is a lot better, and parking is a lot better because everybody is staying home,” he said. But as the economy worsens, Walter worries demand is not going to last. At some point, he said, “people run out of money.”

1307,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",Sanofi shares down despite $13 billion Regeneron payday,"PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Sanofi (PA:SASY) fell on Tuesday despite the French drugmaker's impending $13 billion payday from selling most of its 20.6% stake in U.S. partner Regeneron (O:REGN).
By 1111 GMT, shares in Sanofi were down 1%, in line with the broader European health index (SXDP).
The stake sale, part of a major overhaul under new CEO Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD), will see Regeneron repurchase $5 billion of its stock with the rest set for a public offering. Sanofi will keep some 400,000 Regeneron shares -- a stake of less than 1%. 
Its existing collaborations with the company will continue.
The partnership goes back to 2003 and helped Sanofi to return to profits with the development of several key medicines including eczema treatment Dupixent, which has become a star product for both companies.
Based on Regeneron's closing share price of $569.91 on Friday, the transaction translates into proceeds of around 12 billion euros ($13.15 billion).
""We believe it is a good strategic decision to free up financial resources and to exit from a minority stake with no real strategic value,"" said Bryan Garnier analyst Jean-Jacques Le Fur in a note.
In recent months, Sanofi has simplified its structure and ended research efforts in diabetes and cardiovascular drugs to focus on more lucrative treatments in rare diseases and cancer. 
""The head of research and development John Reed has often said that he would like the group to be more involved in the gene therapy space for example,"" said Le Fur.
The companies' rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara is being tested for treating Covid 19.
Although it will discontinue accounting for its ownership in Regeneron and restate its 2019 earnings, Sanofi said it was still expecting earnings per share to grow by around 5% at constant exchange rates this year. 
The guidance from this new base however implies 2020 earnings per share of 5.83 euros, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) wrote in a note, 6% below its estimates.

1308,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Hedge funds target France as short-selling bans lifted,"By Maiya Keidan
LONDON (Reuters) - A cluster of big name hedge funds have started betting against French companies, moving in after the lifting of a short-selling ban imposed earlier this year to calm financial markets, an analysis of regulatory filings showed.
France joined Italy, Spain, Belgium, Austria and Greece in dropping short-selling bans last week. They had banned the practice for many stocks two months ago to curb extreme stock market volatility caused by economic uncertainty that has resulted from the coronavirus lockdowns.
Hedge funds engage in so-called ""short-selling"" by borrowing a stock from an institutional investor, such as a pension fund, and selling it back when the shares fall, pocketing the profit.
Financial market regulators have banned short-selling during bouts of stock market turbulence in the past because of a perception it can add to market instability.
Regulatory filings in the seven days since the bans ended showed that France accounted for more than half the 125 regulatory notifications of changes to short positions against companies in the six markets.
Citadel, Marshall Wace and Millennium are among hedge funds that have taken out short positions on French companies over the past week, with  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) among the most prominent targets. 
British hedge fund Sandbar Asset Management took the opportunity to double its short position in Air France to 1.2% of the company's equity capital on May 20, from 0.6% on March 17.
London-based Marshall Wace also added to its bet against Air France last week. It rose to 2.72% on May 20 from 2.66% on March 31.
Hedge fund Millennium has made a short bet on payments company Worldline (PA:WLN), while automaker Peugeot and cable industry leader  Nexans  (PA:NEXS) have also attracted hedge fund short sellers.
American hedge fund Citadel added to short positions in automotive supplier  Valeo  (PA:VLOF) and CGG (PA:GEPH), a manufacturer of geophysical equipment.
European short-selling laws mean only bets against companies of 0.5% and above need to be publicly disclosed. It was also not known if hedge funds had offsetting long positions.

Citadel, Millennium, Sandbar and Marshall Wace all declined to comment on their short positions.

Travel and leisure were among the businesses hardest hit by coronaries lockdown as countries closed borders, leaving airlines grounded, and strict social-distancing rules closed restaurants, cinemas and pubs.
But Germany and Spain's plan to ease travel restriction for the peak summer holiday season revived their stocks. TUI (L:TUIT), British Airways owner IAG (L:ICAG), easyJet (L:EZJ) and  Whitbread  (L:WTB) shares jumped 15% to 30%, driving London stock indices higher.
London stocks were top gainers as they played catch-up with continental European stocks, which soared on Monday. The travel and leisure stocks sub-index jumped to its highest levels since April 30.
""There is a lot more hope that travel restrictions across Europe will be eased in time for the summer holidays,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com. ""If the summer holiday season can be saved, it would be a big plus after most of us wrote it off.""

1311,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",COVID-19 lawsuit takes on McDonald's like it was a rowdy bar,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - As U.S. businesses reopen, worried workers and their advocates are borrowing a legal strategy commonly used to shut down rowdy topless bars to try and force employers to strengthen protection against further spread of the coronavirus.
Workers and their families at McDonald's Corp's (N:MCD) Chicago restaurants have filed a class-action lawsuit against the fast-food chain that does not seek money for sick staff, but compliance with health guidance such as providing clean face masks. 
The strategy was unsuccessful against a meatpacking plant but experts said it could work against McDonald's and other companies, and a business group warned about a flood of cases.
""The damage done by inadequate safety practices is not confined to the walls of a restaurant but instead has broader public health consequences,"" Tuesday's lawsuit said.
Like an April lawsuit against a meatpacking plant, the case targets McDonald's as a public nuisance, a legal strategy previously used to shutter strip clubs and the famed Limelight nightclub in Manhattan.
Typically, workplace safety is a matter for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which has the authority to inspect businesses and issue citations. By focusing on community health, the lawsuit attempts to move outside OSHA's jurisdiction and into the courts.
McDonald's workers around the country have protested and demanded safety gear.
In Chicago, workers filed at least four complaints with OSHA, but the agency declined to inspect work sites, according to the lawsuit. 
OSHA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Unions have criticized the agency for lax enforcement and failing to issue mandatory standards for businesses to stem the spread of COVID-19.
""When you don't have an assertive OSHA you get these creative approaches,"" said Michael Duff, a professor at the University of Wyoming College of Law. 
McDonald's called the allegations inaccurate. The company criticized the SEIU service union that is supporting the plaintiffs and said the chain has issued a 59-page guide its restaurants must follow to protect staff and customers. 
The Fight for $15 group, which campaigns to raise the U.S. minimum wage to $15 an hour, is also helping the workers. 
OSHA has said it is investigating thousands of complaints nationwide and that flexible guidance is better than rigid standards. 
The public nuisance doctrine stems from medieval England, where it was used to promote safer roads and to fight infectious diseases. 
To prevail, plaintiffs must prove a defendant interfered with a public good, like the community's health. Unlike a typical lawsuit, it does not generally require proof that the defendant directly injured someone. 
Rather than prove someone was infected with the coronavirus at McDonald's, the workers must instead show the company created an unsafe workplace that posed an imminent threat of contributing to its spread.
A similar public nuisance lawsuit filed in April against a Smithfield Foods Inc meat processing plant in Missouri was dismissed because the judge said workplace safety was a matter for OSHA.
But Smithfield was already being investigated by OSHA and unlike McDonald's, there were no confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Missouri plant.
The Institute for Legal Reform, an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business group, has warned the pandemic could prompt a flood of ""abusive"" lawsuits, and cited the McDonald's public nuisance case in a call with reporters this week.
""The danger is one case survives and like moths to light you’ll see cases all over the place,"" said Michelle Richards, a law professor at the University of Detroit Mercy.
Richard Ausness, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, downplayed the risk of a flood of cases, but said the mere filing of such a lawsuit could push a business to help its workers.

""Who wants to be accused of maintaining a public nuisance? It just sounds awful,"" he said.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Coronavirus spreads in Brazil's oilfields, as five offshore operators register cases","By Gram Slattery and Marta Nogueira
RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Norway's Equinor ASA (OL:EQNR) and Anglo-French firm Perenco are among at least five oil producers that have registered coronavirus cases among employees or contractors at facilities off the coast of Brazil, according to industry and regulatory sources.
Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L:RDSa) and Brazil's Enauta Participacoes SA (SA:ENAT3) have registered one case each, and hundreds of cases have been recorded at oilfields operated by state-run Petrobras (SA:PETR4).
The infections illustrate the threat the virus poses to workers toiling in cramped quarters miles offshore and have raised questions about the effectiveness of extensive testing efforts to contain the pandemic's spread on platforms.
Alongside industries like mining and meatpacking, oil production has come under intense scrutiny during the pandemic as employees are forced to work, sleep and eat in confined areas. 
That is particularly true on offshore oil rigs, service vessels and so-called ""floatels,"" where a single infection can multiply quickly.
In most other nations, outbreaks have been contained to a handful of rigs. U.S. industry group National Ocean Industries Association said it had registered just 99 cases of coronavirus among offshore workers in the United States, according to data shared with Reuters last week.
In Brazil, which last week became the country with the second highest number of coronavirus cases after the United States, that number is significantly higher. 
Oil regulator ANP had registered 544 active coronavirus cases as of Thursday among workers who had accessed offshore facilities. That figure does not include workers who have recovered and the total number of infections remains a mystery.
Equinor has registered approximately 60 cases as of last week, largely at its Peregrino field, according to a source with direct knowledge of data collected by regulators and a source with knowledge of the company's operations.
Perenco has registered approximately 40 at its Pargo field, according to the government source and a source with knowledge of the company's operations.
Asked about the issue, Shell and Enauta told Reuters they have each registered one case.
In a statement provided to Reuters, Equinor acknowledged that it had registered cases but did not provide details of how many. Perenco declined to confirm or deny that any employee had been infected by the virus. 
All four companies emphasized their commitment to protecting workers.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4), as Petrobras is formally known, has registered well over 300 cases among offshore workers, including contractors, the government source said.
The company has acknowledged infections, and said that as of Saturday it had 181 active cases among all of its 46,416 total employees, but that number does not include contractors or employees who have recovered.
The company said it has adopted several safety measures such as large-scale testing, and that the number of cases has stabilized in recent days.
ALL MEASURES TAKEN
Many oil firms are ramping up universal testing and mandating long quarantine periods among workers before they go on board platforms and sterilizing platforms. Yet that has not been enough to contain all offshore outbreaks. 
The infections at Equinor's sprawling Peregrino field, its largest international production asset, spread through workers doing construction work at a new oil platform and the outbreak occurred in multiple waves, the two sources said.
At times, efforts to contain the virus have led Equinor to suspend some construction operations, they said.
The company told Reuters that workers were infected ""despite all the preventative and proactive measures"" taken.
Shell said that its one employee tested positive for the virus upon disembarking from a vessel hired by the company and was in quarantine. No other workers appeared to have been infected, it said.
Enauta said one of its contractors had contracted the virus and has since recovered.
Petrobras has been unable to provide universal testing for workers and contractors before going on board platforms, upsetting unions.
According to the government source and a fourth source with knowledge of Petrobras operations, testing has rolled out at different paces in different regions of Brazil, partially impeded by difficulties finding labs willing and able to process the results.

A Petrobras spokeswoman told Reuters the company has been ramping up its testing capacity as market availability allows, and now tests all workers before they embark except in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open at a two-month high on Tuesday, with Wall Street returning the Memorial Day holiday to see more countries opening up, strengthening hopes that the global economy is moving towards a recovery.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT),S&P 500 Futures traded 55 points, or 1.9%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 166 points, or 1.8%. The Dow Futures contract rose 491 points, or 2%. 
U.S. financial markets were shut Monday for Memorial Day.
The New York Stock Exchange will mark its own reopening milestone on Tuesday as it partially reopens its trading floor.
Earlier Tuesday, Japan, the third largest economy in the world, lifted its state of emergency after a marked fall in new coronavirus cases in Tokyo and other hard-hit regions. The Nikkei 225 closed up 2.6%, to hit a new one month high.
In Europe, Spain, one of the hardest hit countries in the region, will welcome tourists from July 1 with no quarantine, while Germany could lift all travel restrictions in Europe by mid June, according to a report. In the U.K. all non-essential retailers will be able to reopen in England from June 15.
Adding to the positivity is the news that American biotech company  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) said it has begun trials for a coronavirus vaccine in Australia. The company’s stock is over 18% higher premarket.
All of this has tended to overshadow the simmering tensions between Washington and Beijing, including Chinese President Xi saying his country will step up preparedness for military combat, as well as a warning from the World Health Organization that countries with declining numbers of Covid-19 cases could still see an “immediate second peak”.
The first quarter earnings season is continuing to wind down, with retailers again the main companies reporting this week. Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Dollar General (NYSE:DG), Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) and Burlington Stores (NYSE:BURL) are among some of the companies reporting earnings.
Economic data are thin on the ground Tuesday, with the main release being the publication of the Conference Board’s consumer confidence index for May. Confidence plunged to a record low in April as tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs in response to lockdown orders across the country.
Elsewhere, oil futures pushed higher, helped by the reopening of the Japanese economy, signs of more travel in Europe and the news that India will start domestic flights. Closer to home, Delta Air Lines  (NYSE:DAL) stock was up 6.0% despite the bankruptcy filing of Latam, the carrier in which it bought a 20% stake last year for $1.9 billion.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 2.6% higher at $34.12 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.6% to $36.09.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.6% to $1,725.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0953, up 0.5%.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 06:37AM ET</span>",'How about next June?' Small meat processors backlogged as virus idles big plants,"By P.J. Huffstutter and Rod Nickel
CHICAGO/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Inside the small-scale Iowa abattoir Stanhope Locker and Market, owner Shaunna Zanker yawns with exhaustion as she listens to yet another farmer asking her to slaughter his pigs.
""I'm so sorry, but we're booked through March of next year,"" Zanker said on the phone. ""How about next June?""
Slaughter operations like Zanker's are booming as novel coronavirus outbreaks at major U.S. and Canadian meat plants force farmers and meat-loving consumers to seek out alternatives to a crucial supply-chain link. 
Since 1946, this Stanhope, Iowa, shop – one of 1,500 independent American slaughterhouses - has processed a few farm animals from local farms each week and sold cuts of beef and pork to the public. 
Now the family-owned business and others like it are overwhelmed and are forced to turn away farmers. Large meat plants across the United States and Canada are closed or running at reduced capacity. The result: not enough places to slaughter hundreds of thousands of cattle and pigs, and store shelves with little or no meat in major exporting countries that normally have abundant supplies.
Small-scale slaughterhouses account for a miniscule part of the market: Around 80% of U.S. beef is produced by four large companies. Some 1% of American hogs or less are processed at small-scale meat lockers, economists say. 
The consumer rush for meat is straining supplies at TL Keller Meats in Litchfield, Ohio, and forced them for the first time ever to ration sales: Five pounds (2.3 kg) of ground beef per person and two packs of burger patties per family.
Owner Tom Keller and his 23 employees are processing as fast as they can. In March, they slaughtered 104 cattle, twice the rate a year earlier. 
""People are going mad trying to fill their freezers,"" Keller said after putting in a 13-hour day. 
PANIC BUYING
North of the border, Canada's main cattle-producing province, Alberta, is struggling to deal with reduced production at the country's two main beef plants, owned by Cargill Inc (CARG.UL) and JBS SA (SA:JBSS3), both in the province.
The farms where cattle are raised to slaughter-ready weight, known as feedlots, are being turned away by the big plants, which have a backlog of cattle. 
So some are calling Marc Lustenberger, owner of the Meat Chop abattoir near Penhold, Alberta, who already has a brisk business cutting meat for farmers to sell directly to consumers. 
“There's lots of panic buying,"" Lustenberger said. ""Looks like it's not going to stop anytime soon.""
In March and April, Alberta's Red Deer Lake Meats slaughtered twice as many pigs and cattle as it normally does. The provincial agriculture department called Red Deer butcher Darrel Barrett to ask him to pick up some of the slack from the two-week closure of Cargill's plant.
""Which is absurd, with Cargill slaughtering 4,500 head a day,"" Barrett said. ""We're lucky if we do 20 a week."" 
Like other Alberta butchers, Barrett is also busy cutting meat for farms that are suddenly doing booming sales directly to consumers.
One customer, rancher Ben Campbell of Black Diamond, Alberta, pre-sold 10,800 pounds (4,900 kg) of grass-fed beef in two months, one-third more than he sold all of last year.
Small ranchers like Tim Hoven, who runs an organic beef farm near Eckville, Alberta, have years-long relationships with small butchers that are now seeing massive demand. Neighbors, used to delivering to the big plants, are left with cattle that have nowhere to go.
""They're in a tough spot because they're small and they're at the bottom of the list to get that kill spot at these big plants,"" said Hoven, whose meat sales have tripled. 
""They can't get that spot at the small plants"" either.
'NEW WAY TO BUY FOOD'
At Uniontown, Alabama-based BDA Farm, sales have jumped more than 800% in two months, said partner Allen Williams (NYSE:WMB).
""Initially it was panic buying, but it has gone far beyond that now,"" Williams said. ""They're discovering an entirely new way to buy food and they're discovering it's pretty dad-gum convenient.""
""We're selling out of absolutely everything, every single week. But we're running into a choke point - we can't get it all processed."" 
Back in Iowa, Zanker hangs up the phone. It's the 10th farmer to call that day. 
Next, a woman calls asking if Stanhope Locker and Market has meat for sale. They do. The woman lives two hours away. Others have driven further, Zanker said. 

""I had one person call, telling me they had gotten a hog for free,"" Zanker said. ""I told them, 'There's nowhere to take them. Congratulations, you now have a pet.'""

1317,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 26, 2020 06:18AM ET</span>",The Bond Market Thinks It Knows What’s Coming Next From the Fed,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve has already unleashed a barrage of new policies to keep the economy out of depression. Investors reckon it’s lining up another one.The Fed’s version of the strategy known as yield-curve control is expected to involve capping yields on government bonds of a chosen maturity -– by buying however much it takes. For central banks that already cut short-term interest rates to zero, it’s a way to signal that they’ll stay low for an extended period, while helping pin down longer-term borrowing costs too.Japan has been doing this for years, and Australia adopted the idea in March as the coronavirus struck. The Fed, which has responded to the pandemic by bulk-buying Treasuries and showering business and local government with credit, may not be ready to follow suit right now. U.S. states are tentatively emerging from lockdown, and policy makers will want to see how economic activity picks up.
But with unemployment at levels not seen since the 1930s, and Congress deadlocked over another round of fiscal stimulus, Fed officials have been publicly warning that more action will likely be needed. They’re taking another look at their own toolkits, in a policy review due to conclude this year. And the idea of tamping down Treasury yields keeps coming up.
Fed Governor Lael Brainard is a proponent. Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said in a webcast last week that Fed policy makers will probably get a briefing about how other central banks have done it.“We do expect yield-curve control by year-end,” said Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities in New York. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues paint a bleak picture of the economy’s near-term prospects, and they’ll need a strategy to deal with that, she said. “They can’t keep a negative economic outlook without easing monetary policy further.”
Blurred Lines
Other countries have tried negative interest rates, and some investors are betting that U.S. central bankers will follow that path too. But in October, Fed officials unanimously rejected the idea. And Clarida said Thursday that “nothing that has happened since then has changed my mind.”
The Fed is already buying trillions of dollars of government debt this year, as the U.S. borrows in record volumes to fight the virus slump. That combination, echoed across the developed world, is blurring what on paper are supposed to be sharp dividing lines between central banking and fiscal policy.
Yield-curve control, another example of that unconventional mix, would involve a tactical shift by the Fed. Instead of announcing a pre-set volume of Treasury purchases, as it has done under quantitative easing programs, it would buy (or conceivably sell) the debt in whatever volume is needed to maintain the chosen yield.Capping debt costs for the government, the argument goes, will benefit other borrowers in the economy too because those rates are benchmarks in key industries such as housing. Fed officials who favor the strategy also see it as a way of putting an exclamation point on their intentions to keep the short-rate low for a period of time.Japan, which pioneered yield-curve control in 2016, chose to pin 10-year rates at zero. When Australia adopted the idea in March, it plumped for 3-year debt and a target yield of 0.25%. The U.S. is more likely to follow the Australian example and focus on the short end of the curve, investors say.
That could mean maturities of two or three years, Tiffany Wilding, an economist at Pimco, told Bloomberg TV last week. Mansoor Mohi-uddin, a senior macro strategist at NatWest Markets in Singapore, predicts somewhere between two and five years.“That would allow longer-term yields to move above those targets and keep the curve upward-sloping, which enables financial institutions to generate profits,” Mohi-uddin said.
Wartime Precedent
Treasuries have already stabilized after some violent swings in the early days of the pandemic crisis, when at one point the entire yield curve crashed below 1%, with many maturities reaching all-time lows.The 10-year note, a benchmark for global borrowing, has fluctuated around 0.7%, more than double its record low in March. Two-year yields have been trading below the 0.25% level that marks the top of the Fed’s target range, while 5-year yields are slightly above it.And the yield gap between these securities and longer-dated debt has been widening -– especially as the Treasury has tilted issuance toward the latter. It sold 20-year bonds on Wednesday for the first time since the 1980s.
Long-dated securities were part of the deal last time the U.S. experimented with a policy of yield-curve control. To help finance World War II, the Fed agreed to cap 30-year bonds at 2.5%.This time around, focusing only on shorter-term debt would help allay concern that central-bank independence is being subordinated to fiscal needs, according to Zach Pandl, a strategist at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), who says yield-curve control is an option for the Fed along with more QE and even possibly negative rates.
“This would be about providing monetary stimulus rather than keeping Treasury’s borrowing costs fixed,” said Pandl. “If economic conditions change, and the recovery is faster than expected, the Fed would have the ability to move away from yield curve control and tighten policy.”For now, according to minutes of its last rates meeting in April, the Fed is more concerned about demonstrating a commitment to staying loose.
Officials discussed tying the benchmark interest rate to an inflation or unemployment goal, or pegging it around zero for an extended period. And a few suggested that capping short- to medium-term yields could strengthen the signal of their guidance on the short-term rate.
“Yield curve control would reinforce that the Fed is going to keep rates low, and allay fears it will be overly reactive by removing accommodation at the first sign of inflation,” said Jonathan Cohn, a strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN).

1319,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 06:00AM ET</span>",Israel taps local desalination firm IDE over Hong Kong rival,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel on Tuesday chose local company IDE Technologies over a Chinese-linked rival to build the country's largest desalination plant to tackle water shortages in one of the driest parts of the world.
IDE competed for the tender against Hutchison Water, whose main investor is Hong Kong's CK Hutchison Holdings (HK:0001).
Israel's chief ally, the United States, which is uneasy about Chinese involvement in Israeli critical infrastructure, had expressed misgivings about Hutchison's bid.
""The bid by the Israeli firm was better, by a significant margin, the price was cheaper, by a significant margin, than that of the other bidders - including the Chinese, who did indeed reach the final stage,"" Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz told Israel Radio.
The project, to be financed by a consortium of banks including Bank Leumi (TA:LUMI), Germany's KfW [KFW.UL] and the European Investment Bank, will increase Israel's desalination capacity by 35% and lower water costs, the government said in a statement.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, during a visit to Israel this month, told public broadcaster Kan that Chinese participation in Israeli infrastructure and communications systems could jeapordise U.S. cooperation. He did not specifically reference the desalination plant.
""It does not seem to me that this desalination facility is a top priority for them (the United States),"" Israel's Steinitz said. ""In any event, all's well that ends well.""
The reverse osmosis plant, the largest of its kind, will be built in Soreq, central Israel, near an air base which hosts U.S.-Israeli missile tests.
The Soreq plant is expected to come online in 2023, with annual production capacity of 200 million cubic metres. 
It will be the sixth desalination plant Israel has built along its Mediterranean coast as the country braces for the risk climate change and regional conflicts could aggravate water shortages.

1320,By Investing.com,"<span>May 26, 2020 05:43AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Lockdown Is Over (Part II): Let's Go Down the Pub,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The recovery trade in Europe is finally on.
The benchmark Stoxx 600 hit an 11-week high morning trade on Tuesday as U.K. institutions reopening after the long holiday weekend played catch up with a rally that had started on Monday in response to the lifting of various lockdown measures, notably Spain’s reopening of its tourism sector.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the Stoxx 600 was up 1.1% at 348.98, having earlier hit an intraday high of 349.72, its highest since March 10. The tourism-sensitive Spanish IBEX 35 outperformed again with a gain of 1.4%, while the U.K. midcap index, the FTSE 250, rose 3.2% in anticipation that the government will be forced to relax lockdown measures that its own staff can’t be bothered to observe. Pub operator  Mitchells & Butlers  (LON:MAB) stock rose 26.5% (partly inspired by last week's deal between Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) A/S B (CSE:CARLb) and Marston’s (LON:MARS).
While that’s not a clear breakout from the sideways trading range of recent weeks for the Stoxx, the odds must be that it is pulled higher when U.S. markets also reopen after the Memorial Day holiday later on Tuesday.
It’s possible to argue with the long-term benefits of buying into stocks whose business model has been ruthlessly exposed by the pandemic. But in the short term, at least, many institutions will be forced back into sectors that have underperformed in the last two months or risk missing their own performance benchmarks.
Hence the startling outperformance – for a second straight day – of the travel and leisure sectors. IAG (LON:ICAG) and EasyJet (LON:EZJ) shares rose more than 20%, while  Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA  (OL:NWC) stock rose 17% and Melia Hotels (MC:MEL) rose another 17%.
“Late innings but not the last,” analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a weekly note to clients. They argued that sentiment towards the recent rally has started to shift, away from skepticism and the conviction that it was being fueled only by central bank support, towards the acceptance of a more fundamental improvement in the economic outlook.
Analysts have been saying for months that they expected the bottom of the downturn to occur in the second quarter. The modest improvements in Germany’s Ifo Business Climate on Monday, and in the GfK consumer confidence survey out earlier on Tuesday, appear to back that up.
But the more important factor is surely that investors are reacting to what they are seeing and hearing themselves. There are more people out of doors, more cars on the streets (including those of U.K. government advisors checking their eyesight), and the direction of travel as regards government policy has clearly changed for the better, with countries reopening borders, relaxing lockdowns and – according to German reports – preparing to lift travel warnings for tourists.
On top of all this, there appears to be more stimulus on the way: Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau came out strongly in a speech for acting “rapidly and powerfully”, comments interpreted by many as a signal that the European Central Bank will expand its latest bond-buying program, the so-called PEPP, at its council meeting on June 4.
What’s not to like?

""We have around 1,000 staff at head office and of those we will reduce 300,"" Eurowings Chief Executive Jens Bischof told a briefing in Duesseldorf.
Germany threw Lufthansa a 9 billion euro ($9.8 billion) lifeline on Monday, agreeing a bailout which gives Berlin a veto in the event of a hostile bid for the airline.
Bischof, in remarks embargoed for publication on Tuesday, did not give figures for job reductions in other operational areas at Eurowings, which employs a total of around 4,000 staff.

He said the outcome would depend on negotiations with staff representatives and how work is allocated in future between Lufthansa and Eurowings. It would likely take until 2023 before activity returns to last year's levels.

1322,By Investing.com,"<span>May 26, 2020 03:49AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Higher; Travel Sector Soars As Reopenings Gather Speed,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets rose Tuesday, helped by the sight of more and more economies reopening for business and by growing signs that the worst of the downturn may be over.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 1.3%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 1.7%, outperforming after returning from Monday’s holiday.
The pace of economic revival has picked up markedly in the last week, with Spain's announcement of the reopening of its tourist sector having a particularly big impact. Reports also suggest that the German government wants to end a travel warning for tourist trips to 31 European countries from June 15, ending a further constraint on a major part of consumer spending in the region.
Japan too has ended states of emergency in its last five prefectures, including Tokyo. And in Europe 
“A full reopening of Japan, and vaccine hopes from the United States, has shunted Hong Kong worries to the back of the equity market’s minds,” Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacific., wrote in a note, reported by Bloomberg. “The peak-virus trade continues to maintain its strong positive momentum.”
In corporate news, Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) stock rose over 6%, continuing Monday’s gains after the German government agreed a 9 billion euro ($9.8 billion) bailout, which gives Berlin a veto in the event of a hostile bid for the airline. The agreement, which cements Lufthansa's near-complete monopoly on domestic flights within Europe's largest economy, still faces hurdles in gaining EU antitrust approval.
With other bailouts now seen as more likely and with the economic headwinds apparently fading, travel sector stocks are soaring again. IAG (LON:ICAG), the owner of British Airways, gained over 15%, easyJet (LON:EZJ) over 10%, Ryanair (LON:RYA) over 9% and Air France KLM  (PA:AIRF) more than 8%. Additionally, Travel group Tui (DE:TUIGn) surged 18% after its CEO said the company will resume flights at the end of June.
Turning to the autos sector,  Aston Martin  (LON:AML) soared 32% after the UK luxury carmaker confirmed that Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG, would become its chief executive officer.
Also, French carmakers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Peugeot (OTC:PUGOY) jumped 5% and 3% respectively as President Emmanuel Macron said support for the hard-hit car sector will be ""massively amplified"".
The crude oil market has pushed higher, helped by the news that Japan, the third largest economy in the world, was reopening as well as the resumption of domestic flights in India.
At 3:55 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 3.5% higher at $34.42 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.2% to $36.30.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.4% to $1,729.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0935, up 0.3%."

The ruling on a disputed contract was seen as opening the door to a wave of similar litigation.
AXA also said it would provide a further 500 million euros ($546 million) in aid for small companies.
Chief executive Thomas Buberl said AXA planned to compensate business interruption losses to the majority of restaurant owners whose contracts were similar to the one studied by the court.
""These contracts represent less than 10% out of total contracts with restaurant owners and I am confident that we will find a solution,"" Bubbler said.
""We want to compensate a substantial part of these contracts, we want to do it quickly"".
French insurers have already announced plans to invest 1.7 billion euros in domestic companies, particularly in the hospitality sector. AXA said on top of that, it would invest 500 million euros in the capital of small and mid-sized companies.

""The idea is clearly to reinforce those companies which are weakened by this crisis,"" Buberl said.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 03:20AM ET</span>",Frozen UK property funds face existential crisis,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - British property funds are set to remain frozen for months as the market is impossible to value due to the coronavirus crisis, and some may need to change structure to survive, industry sources say.
Ten big open-ended property funds tracked by Morningstar, with a total of 6.5 billion pounds ($8 billion) under management, stopped investors from getting their money out in mid March, saying valuers could not accurately assess real estate assets in a plunging economy.
With question marks over the future of office working, the retail industry in crisis and the housing market only just reopening, the price of property is set for a major readjustment, but a dearth of transactions means the scale of change is still unclear.
""This is a crisis unlike any other,"" said Ben Sanderson, a director at Hermes Real Estate Investment Management
""In the short term, it's going to be hugely challenging.""
Many of the Morningstar-tracked funds are aimed at retail investors who could take their money out daily, managed by household names like  Aviva  (L:AV) and  Legal & General  (L:LGEN).
Such funds also suspended during the 2008/09 financial crisis and after the 2016 Brexit vote because their hard-to-sell assets meant they could not meet daily redemption requests.
But this crisis has extended further into the 70 billion pound UK property fund sector.
For the first time, funds aimed at institutional investors like charities and pension funds have also locked their doors.
These funds typically only allow redemptions monthly or quarterly. 
Twenty of the 29 institutional-focused funds in the MSCI/AREF UK All Balanced Property Fund Index have suspended or deferred redemption payments, according to a Reuters survey, including funds managed by BlackRock (N:BLK), Federated Hermes (N:FHI), Savills and  Schroders  (L:SDR). 
Three with different structures have remained open and six did not respond to requests for comment. 
CONFIDENCE DAMAGED
Industry sources said it was unlikely funds would unfreeze before September, and what happens then is unclear.
Suspensions enable funds to treat customers equally, preventing a rush for the exits which means slow movers get a lower price for their investments. 
The funds say these suspensions are related to valuation problems and, unusually, do not follow a flood of redemption requests.
However, Morningstar data shows 126 million pounds left the top funds it tracks in the first half of March before they suspended, compared with 103 million for the whole of February and 43 million in January.
Investors may flee once funds reopen.
""Suspensions damage the confidence of investors,"" said Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell.
Retail funds say they have high levels of cash, helping them cope with any redemptions. 
Institutional funds say their investors take a long view, and will continue to favour real estate for diversification and yield.
But for those funds which do need to sell assets to raise cash, it will be difficult.
Jessica Berney, manager of the 2.6 billion pound Schroder UK Real Estate Fund, said the fund had completed three large transactions since the virus outbreak, but there have been no new deals in the market since then.
Buyers are waiting - Ronald Dickerman, president of U.S. property investor Madison, said the firm would like to ""provide liquidity"" to the funds' investors - but sources say any sales would likely be at discounted prices.
Funds could close if they cannot meet redemption requests. Veteran UK investor Neil Woodford's equity income fund suspended trading last June before closing in October.
To avoid future suspensions, funds may change structure.
Alastair Sewell, senior director, fund and asset management at ratings agency Fitch, said regulatory pressure could see funds follow peers in countries like Finland or Germany, where real estate investors must hold investments for anything from three months to two years.

Funds could also become investment trusts, which contain a fixed number of units.

""The board has determined that now is the time for new leadership to deliver our plans,"" Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin Lagonda's Executive Chairman said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares forged ahead on Tuesday while U.S. stock futures breached a major chart barrier as investors brushed past Sino-U.S. trade tensions to more stimulus in China and a re-opening world economy.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) took the lead with a rise of 1.7% to its highest since early March when the economic impact of the coronavirus was just becoming clear.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 1.6%, while South Korea (KS11) rose 1.5%.
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 climbed 2% to clear the 3,000 chart level. EUROSTOXX 50 futures added 0.98% and FTSE futures 2.2%.
Chinese blue chips (CSI300) firmed 0.8% after the country's central bank said it would strengthen economic policy and continue to push to lower interest rates on loans.
While largely reiterations of past comments, they helped offset the war of words between Washington and Beijing over trade, the coronavirus and China's proposals for stricter security laws in Hong Kong.
""U.S.-China tensions continue to simmer in the background, but equity investors appear more interested on the prospect of economies reopening around the globe,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB.
""On this score, Japan ended its nationwide state of emergency, Spaniards have returned to bars in Madrid wearing masks and England will reopen some businesses on June 1.""
There were reports Tuesday that Germany wants to end a travel warning for tourist trips to 31 European countries from June 15 if the coronavirus situation allows.
Bond investors suspect economies will still need massive amounts of central bank support long after they reopen and that is keeping yields low even as governments borrow much more.
Yields on U.S. 10-year notes were trading at 0.67% having recovered from a blip up to 0.68% last week when the market absorbed a tidal wave of new issuance.
The decline in U.S. yields might have been a burden for the dollar but with rates everywhere near or less than zero, major currencies have been holding to tight ranges.
The dollar was a fraction firmer on the yen on Monday at 107.83  but well within the 105.97 to 108.08 band that has lasted since the start of May.
The euro was a shade firmer at $1.0916 (EUR=), having spent the month so far wandering between $1.0765 and $1.1017.
Against a basket of currencies the dollar was 0.2% lower at 99.620 (=USD), but still sandwiched between support at 99.001 and resistance around 100.560.
Analysts at CBA felt the dollar could break higher should China-U.S. tensions actually threaten their trade deal.
""Although not our central scenario, if the U.S. or China were to withdraw from the Phase One deal, USD would sharply appreciate while CNH, AUD and NZD would decline,"" they wrote in a note to clients.
In commodity markets, gold edged up 0.2% to $1,733 an ounce. 
Oil prices were supported by falling supplies as OPEC cut production and the number of U.S. and Canadian rigs dropped to record lows for the third week running. 

Brent crude futures rose 71 cents to $36.24 a barrel, while U.S. crude gained $1.14 to $34.39.

Contracts on the S&P 500 rose to 3,000.50, the highest since March 6, as of 1:04 p.m. in Tokyo, adding to gains during overnight trading from their closing level of 2,953.00 on May 22. The underlying S&P 500 closed at 2,955.45 on Friday. U.S. financial markets were shut Monday for Memorial Day.
“It’s the grand re-opening that matters, with the S&P 500 within earshot of the psychologically fundamental 3,000 mark,” Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, wrote in a research note. “If traders can put some headroom above that level, the view that this rally is only a bounce from oversold will most certainly give way to the wall of money argument, triggering another considerable round of bear market capitulation.”
U.S. index futures extended gains on Monday after German businesses surveyed by Ifo showed cautious optimism in May, with a gauge of expectations rising after the previous month’s plunge. The report preceded data showing South Korea’s consumer confidence jumped in May from the lowest level since the global financial crisis as progress in curbing the coronavirus outbreak somewhat eased concerns about the economy.
Japan’s stock market advanced as the nation inched toward resuming more activities Tuesday after a dropoff in virus cases led the government to end its state of emergency and bring a new focus to rebuilding a battered economy. Meanwhile, Hong Kong’s leader defended China’s moves to impose sweeping national security laws in the territory amid renewed protests and growing international concern over what it would mean for the city’s future autonomy.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 01:11AM ET</span>","'This could be the one that gets me,' says oilfield service veteran","By Liz Hampton
(Reuters) - Tim Harris was preparing to relocate for an assignment with energy services firm  Halliburton Co  (N:HAL) for the fifth time in 15 years when his career came to a halt. 
A third-generation employee, Harris rose through the ranks at the top shale-oil services provider to oversee oilfield crews. He sailed through several busts, with the exception of a 9-month break in 2016. 
But April's historic price crash, which has left U.S. crude prices down 50% since January, put him and tens of thousands of oil service veterans out of work. The cuts have gone deep into the ranks of managers, taking seniority and skills gained through past downturns. 
Such cuts, which are expected to accelerate this year, spell trouble for firms when it comes to restaffing and tapping know-how from prior busts, said some industry executives interviewed by Reuters. 
Halliburton this month cut 22% of its headquarters staff while Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) recently reshuffled its executive team and warned of ""significant"" expenses for job cuts this quarter. Oil major BP (NYSE:BP) plans to cut half its senior managers in coming months. 
Since March, some 66,300 oilfield jobs, or 8.5% of the sector's workforce disappeared, according to an analysis by trade group Petroleum Equipment and Services Association. For all of 2016, when crude oil prices slumped amid a supply glut, employment in the sector fell 17.4%. 
""Losing talented people is a concern,"" said Kevin Broom, a PESA director who did the analysis. ""We're going to need that knowledge and expertise when demand returns.""
Harris has cut his oil ties, moving to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), where he accepted an entry-level manager's job in light of the 14.7% April U.S. unemployment rate. 
The oil industry could struggle to re-hire experienced managers if other sectors rebound first, said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council. 
Career website LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).com has dozens of goodbye posts from workers with 15- to 30-year careers in the oilfield, many with top firms Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes Inc. More than two dozen tributes appeared recently from mid- to senior-level Schlumberger executives. 
""I'm joining the crowd posting my departure via retirement from Schlumberger after 34-years,"" Jatinder Kalra, a team leader, wrote in a heartfelt post. 
""It's Armageddon for oilfield service companies,"" said Andrew Graham (NYSE:GHM), a 20-year Schlumberger veteran cut in April. He was the only member of his sales team in the last bust to keep his job. This time, ""There's no work,"" he said. 
Graham was attending a family celebration when his mobile phone buzzed with news that top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia ended a pact that limited their oil production.
""I told my wife, 'This could be the one that gets me,'"" Graham recalled in an interview with Reuters. 
In some ways, the scale of the latest job reductions is unprecedented. Fracking services provider ProPetro Holding Corp (N:PUMP) cut 89% of its workforce, according to state workforce filings. 
Halliburton, which cut over 8% of its North American staff last year and furloughed 3,500 employees in March, since has cut another 2,000 jobs in Texas alone. 
""This is truly a tragedy for many of these mid-level to senior executives,"" said Ed Hirs, an energy researcher at the University of Houston.
 Primoris Services  Corp (O:PRIM) operations manager Ray Scriven was cut in late March via a Zoom call. Despite losing his job, he said he could understand why highly skilled workers were let go.

""I know they're faced with decisions they've never had to make before,"" Scriven said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - China's aviation regulator may make it difficult for Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) to merge regional arm Cathay Dragon into its main brand because of infractions during last year's pro-democracy protests, two sources said.
The airline is looking to cut costs, streamline marketing and consolidate pilot contracts around Cathay Pacific and low-cost arm HK Express (NYSE:EXPR), the sources said on condition of anonymity.
Rival Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) is doing the same with regional arm SilkAir and budget arm Scoot.
But the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) would view such a move as an expansion and could block Cathay from keeping access to 20 mainland routes flown only by Dragon.
The Cathay Pacific brand flies only to Beijing and Shanghai, while Dragon destinations include smaller cities like Fuzhou and Nanjing. 
China's aviation regulator stepped up inspections of Cathay planes last fall after warning the airline that staff participating in anti-government protests in Hong Kong would no longer be allowed to fly to mainland destinations or even in Chinese airspace.
During that period, Cathay's chief executive resigned and the brand received enough demerit points for minor infractions under the strict CAAC system that the regulator can deny an application to add mainland destinations and aircraft, including Dragon's, three sources said.
The six demerits received, according to two of the sources, mean it could take a year from the date of the most recent one, near the end of last year, to be allowed to expand, CAAC demerit rules posted online say.
Cathay, which is doing a strategic review amid the collapse in demand related to the coronavirus, declined to comment on its plans for Dragon, its demerit points and its talks with the CAAC.
""Given the very dynamic situation we are currently in, we are not taking anything off the table and we can't rule out anything to ensure our airline business will come out from the crisis stronger and more competitive,"" the company said in a statement.
The CAAC did not respond to a request for comment. 
The regulatory pushback has contributed to weeks of delays in Cathay's plans to meet with its pilot's union to discuss structural changes it first flagged to them in a letter on April 22, the sources said. 
A meeting has been tentatively set for June 10, one of the sources said. The union declined to comment.
The airline is considering moves such as moving veteran pilots to cheaper contracts as it looks to cut costs, the sources said. 
The removal of the Dragon brand would mean some of those pilots move to Cathay Pacific and others to HK Express, the sources said, with early retirement offers and layoffs also possible. 
Dragon has a fleet of 25 Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A330 widebodies and 23 A320 family narrowbodies. 

Cathay has already said it will shift 16 new A321neos for Dragon to HK Express, which operates only narrowbodies and has only one destination on the mainland, Ningbo.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian stocks will not recoup this year's losses anytime soon and 2020 will mark the worst annual performance in nine years on fears of a deep downturn in the economy and business activity, a Reuters poll of market strategists found.
Over 55% of 34 strategists who answered a separate question said the benchmark BSE Sensex Index (BSESN) would revisit this year's low of 25,638.90 hit on March 24. All but one said it would happen by the end of September.
While the index has recovered nearly 20% since hitting a record low - a day before the nationwide lockdown started on March 25 - it is still down around 26% so far this year.
That is despite $266 billion of economic stimulus announced by the government and the aggressive liquidity measures and interest rate cuts from the Reserve Bank of India.
The BSE index was forecast to gain 4.2% to 31,960 by the end of 2020 from Friday's close above 30,672, according to the median forecast from the latest poll. It was taken before the RBI's latest unscheduled meeting on Friday, where it cut the repo rate by another 40 basis points to a record low of 4.00%.
If the poll forecast is correct, that would leave the index down by 22.5% for this calendar year, its worst performance since 2011 and a massive downgrade from 43,560 predicted in the last Reuters poll three months ago.
While the BSE Sensex was then expected to climb to 35,500 by mid-2021, and to 38,000 by the end of 2021, it would still be well below the record high of 42,273.87 hit on Jan. 20 this year, before the first coronavirus case was reported in India.
""Indian equities now look fairly attractive compared to other emerging market equities. But a likely economic contraction this year and a slow recovery beyond that means potential gains (in stocks) will be limited,"" said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics.
Over 85% of strategists - 29 of 34 - who answered an additional question said the current macroeconomic backdrop and higher unemployment poses a ""high"" or a ""very high"" risk to their outlook for the next three months.
(GRAPHIC - Reuters Poll: India stock market outlook - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/polling/xegpbykjwvq/India%20equity.PNG)
More than 60% - or 18 of 29 respondents - said corporate earnings performance would hit a trough in the current quarter or next.

""We believe the index can revisit the lows during the current quarter results season between June and August. The lockdown is going to have a severe impact on the earnings results and recovery will be very gradual from there on,"" said Jyoti Roy, equity strategist at Angel Broking.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) plans to invest in Farasis Energy's planned $480 million IPO, aiming to ensure a stable supply of batteries from the Chinese firm as it ramps up electric vehicle production, three people familiar with the matter said.
The plan has yet to be finalised and is subject to change, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the discussions were private. The size of the potential investment was not immediately clear, they added. 
The two firms struck a deal last year for Farasis to supply Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) with lithium-ion battery cells and Farasis is building a factory in Germany.
Daimler and Farasis declined to comment on the potential IPO investment. 
Eleven-year old Farasis gained approval last week to raise about 3.44 billion yuan in an initial public offering on China's Nasdaq-like STAR board. The float, which is slated for the current quarter, could value the company at up to 30 billion yuan ($4.2 billion), sources have previously said.
Like many other global automakers under pressure to meet tougher emission standards in Europe and China, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz vehicles plans to ramp up EV production. It currently procures batteries from China's CATL (SZ:300750) for its China-made EQC electric car.
Automakers are keen to build deeper relationships with battery makers to manage supply, either by investing in the companies or signing long-term contracts. 
Sources said in January that Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) was looking at taking a 20% stake in Chinese battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd (SZ:002074).
Farasis, which is based in Ganzhou city in the eastern province of Jiangxi, will use the IPO proceeds for a lithium-ion battery project and to replenish its working capital, according to its preliminary prospectus. 
The company, which has plants in Ganzhou and Zhenjiang, also counts China's BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co Ltd (SS:600733) and Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (SS:601633) as major customers.

A combination of smooth re-openings, improving infection rates, high retail-investor cash levels and the historically extreme relationship between growth and value stocks all support conditions for a risk-on rotation in the next couple of months, strategist Dennis DeBusschere wrote in a note Monday.
“Another round of fiscal support and a treatment/cure are critical for a persistent value rotation,” DeBusschere said. “The next two months could be the sweet spot for that trade as a fiscal stimulus is likely before the end of July and the huma- ingenuity trade (vaccine/cure development) remains positive” in Evercore ISI’s view, he wrote.
Value stocks have continued their long period of underperformance against growth peers amid the Covid-19 market uncertainty. The Russell 1000 Growth Index is up 2.5% year-to-date, while its value counterpart is off 20%. Without a macroeconomic turn, the case for value stocks remains weak, Bloomberg Intelligence Chief Equity Strategist Gina Martin Adams said May 15.
Quant Factors Are Swinging the Most Since 2009 in Stock Whiplash
If reopenings remain smooth, it reduces the chance that a second wave of Covid-19 will cause significant economic disruption -- which in turn boosts the medium-term economic outlook and increases the attractiveness of equities, DeBusschere wrote. It would also reduce credit spreads, causing stocks with lower credit ratings to outperform near-term, he added.
“The P/E spread between the top quintile of historical growth and traditional value stocks is extreme,” DeBusschere wrote. “Investors need to be prepared for a violent move toward value if there is better-than-expected economic news or development of a vaccine.”

Investing.com – Asian stocks were on the rise after U.S. biotechnology company  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) raised hopes for a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus.
The company has started clinical trials for vaccine and targets preliminary results by July. Phase 2 of the trial will start once phase one is successfully completed, and is expected to take place in several countries including the U.S.
“Administering our vaccine in the first participants of this clinical trial is a significant achievement, bringing us one step closer toward addressing the fundamental need for a vaccine in the fight against the global COVID‑19 pandemic,” Novavax's CEO Stanely C. Erck said in a statement.
The news helped to improve investor sentiment, unnerved by rising U.S.-China tensions in the aftermath of a proposed national security law for Hong Kong and Macau.
Sentiment was also boosted as lockdown measures continue to be loosened globally and governments attempt to undo the virus’ economic damage.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 led the gains, jumped 2.07% by 10:24 PM ET (3:24 AM GMT). Japanese shares reached a ten-year high after the states of emergency was lifted for the last five prefectures, including Tokyo.
""U.S.-China tensions continue to simmer in the background, but equity investors appear more interested on the prospect of economies reopening around the globe,"" said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB, told Reuters.

Paulo reported late on Monday.
According to the paper, which cites sources with knowledge of the matter, Latam is considering filing for Chapter 11 in the U.S. and equivalent bankruptcy protection in Chile and Brazil, where are the company's largest operations.
In a statement to Reuters, Latam said it ""does not comment on speculation"" and that if it had something to report, it would do through official channels with regulators. 
PJT Partners did not immediately reply to a request for comment late on Monday. 
LATAM was downgraded by S&P and Fitch on Friday after the company confirmed it did not pay interest and principal on three tranches of 2015 $1 billion enhanced equipment trust certificates (EETC). 
Now the company has 15 days to resolve the payment or it can be declared in default by creditors according to cross default clauses.
In a Monday report, credit research company Lucror Analytics said the chances for a debt restructuring transaction or bankruptcy protection filing were rising. 
Lucror estimates LATAM is burning through around $7 million in cash daily in the second quarter and had $1.3 billion in cash in April. 

Lucror notes, though, that the company may receive support from Brazilian development bank BNDES, although the credit could take time to materialize and the loan could only be used to support LATAM’s Brazilian operations. Financial support is not expected from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which owns 20% of LATAM’s shares.

1342,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 25, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Finance Has a Security Blanket,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- China’s decision to impose a national security law on Hong Kong has spurred speculation of capital flight and an erosion of the city’s status as an international financial center. As a venue for share offerings, at least, the near-term future is looking bright. For that, the territory can thank worsening U.S.-China relations.
U.S.-listed Chinese technology companies are lining up to sell stock in Hong Kong, seeking refuge from an environment that has become increasingly less hospitable. Nasdaq-traded JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. are planning secondary listings in the city next month, following a trail blazed by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. in November. Optimism that more companies will join them drove shares of Hong Kong’s exchange operator up more than 6% on Monday.
There’s every reason to expect these stock offerings to do well, and push Hong Kong back up the rankings of the world’s largest fundraising centers. So far this year, the city is the sixth-largest market by capital raised. It topped the table for the whole of 2019 when New York-listed Alibaba sold $13 billion of stock, underscoring the existence of a strong local investor base for China’s most successful companies.
The reception for Alibaba suggests that Asian institutional investors want to be able to trade China’s leading enterprises in their own time zone. JD and NetEase are also among the nation’s technology champions. Beijing-based JD competes with Alibaba in e-commerce, while Hangzhou-based NetEase is behind some of the most popular mobile games in China. Beyond these two, search-engine operator Baidu Inc. is considering delisting from Nasdaq and moving to an exchange nearer home, Reuters reported last week. The coronavirus has exacerbated tensions between Washington and Beijing, while scandals such as fabricated sales at  Luckin Coffee  (NASDAQ:LK) Inc. have spurred politicians to push for tighter regulation, giving Chinese companies an incentive to list elsewhere.
Hong Kong is an obvious choice. The city burnished its appeal for U.S.-traded companies last week when the compiler of the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index said it would change its rules to admit secondary listings and companies with dual-class share structures. Stocks that join the benchmark can expect inflows from passive investors such as exchange-traded funds that track the index.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). reckons that 23 of the 249 Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. meet Hong Kong’s criteria for a secondary listing, which require companies to have a market value of $5.2 billion or, alternatively, a combination of $129 million in annual sales and a $1.3 billion market cap. JD tops the group with a value of $73 billion.
An even more alluring prize would be inclusion of secondary listings in Hong Kong’s stock-trading links with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, which would enable mainland Chinese investors to buy these shares. Alibaba wasn’t included in the stock connect, to the disappointment of some investors. China’s government could yet decide to make this happen.
It’s a reminder that Beijing has levers at its disposal to help shore up Hong Kong’s economy and financial industry, which accounts for a fifth of the city’s gross domestic product — as it did after the SARS epidemic in 2003, when half a million people demonstrated against the Hong Kong government’s first, aborted attempt to introduce national security legislation. 
Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. surged the most in 18 months Monday even as unrest returned to the city. Listing of American depositary receipts may double the exchange operator’s revenue,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said. The Hang Seng Index, meanwhile, stabilized after slumping 5.6% on Friday.
An exodus of businesses, people and capital may yet imperil Hong Kong’s role as an international financial center. The IPO outlook suggests that, rather than a sudden demise, that’s likely to be a long drawn-out process.

1343,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",Germany stamps authority on Lufthansa with $9.8 billion lifeline,"By Arno Schuetze and Michael Nienaber
FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany threw Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) a 9 billion euro ($9.8 billion) lifeline on Monday, agreeing a bailout which gives Berlin a veto in the event of a hostile bid for the airline.
The largest German corporate rescue since the coronavirus crisis struck will see the government get a 20% stake, which could rise to 25% plus one share in the event of a takeover attempt, as it seeks to protect thousands of jobs.
Lufthansa has been locked in talks with Berlin for weeks over aid it needs to survive an expected protracted travel slump, with the airline wrangling over how much control to yield in return for financial support.
Germany's central government has spent decades offloading stakes in companies, but remains a large shareholder in former state monopolies such as Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY) and Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY). Berlin also still has a 15% holding in Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), which it took on during the global financial crisis. 
Other airlines including Franco-Dutch Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and U.S. carriers American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) have also sought state aid after the coronavirus hit global travel.
Germany's Finance and Economy Ministries said on Monday that Lufthansa, whose shares closed up 7.5% at 8.64 euros, had been operationally healthy and profitable with good prospects, but had run into trouble because of the pandemic.
""The support that we're preparing here is for a limited period,"" Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said of the deal, under which Germany is buying new shares at the nominal value of 2.56 euros apiece for a total of about 300 million euros.
Berlin, which has set up a 100 billion euro fund to take stakes in companies struck by the coronavirus crisis, said it plans to sell the Lufthansa stake by the end of 2023.
""When the company is fit again, the state will sell its stake and hopefully ... with a small profit that puts us into a position to finance the many, many requirements which we have to meet now, not only at this company,"" Scholz added.
Conditions of the deal include the waiver of future dividend payments and limits on management pay, Lufthansa said, adding that the government will also fill two seats on its supervisory board, with one becoming a member of the audit committee.
SILENT PARTICIPATION
Under the bailout package, details of which were earlier reported by Reuters, the government will also inject 5.7 billion euros in non-voting capital, known as a silent participation.
Part of this could be converted into an additional 5% equity stake, either to protect Lufthansa against a hostile takeover or in case coupon payments of 4% in 2020 and 2021, increasing to 9.5% by 2027, are missed by the airline.
""This (bailout deal) will prevent Lufthansa from being sold out,"" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said, adding that it would help to save thousands of jobs but did not include any extra environmental conditions on top of planned measures.
Lufthansa will separately receive a 3-billion-euro three-year loan from state-backed KfW and private banks.
The state's WSF rescue fund plans to refrain from exercising voting rights at regular shareholder meetings under the bailout deal, which still requires approval by shareholders as well as the European Commission, Lufthansa said.
Altmaier declined to give details about the remaining sticking points in negotiations with the European Commission, but he said he was convinced that Brussels would give the green light for the bailout.
""We liaised with Brussels on all big rescue packages with which we avoided millions of unemployed and prevented a lot of companies from bankruptcy. They were all approved at the end... so this gives me hope that we'll also find a solution in this case,"" Altmaier told ARD public television.
Germany is still discussing with Europe's competition watchdog which airport slots it will have to give up to ensure the bailout does not hamper competition, a person close to the matter said.
""Scrutiny is extremely thorough as it is the first large equity-based bailout in the pandemic,"" the source said. 

German newspaper Handelsblatt reported that Chancellor Angela Merkel told fellow conservatives during a closed-door meeting on Monday that Berlin would fight to ensure that remedies were not too stringent.

Minister Tarcisio Freitas also said the government's plan to revive economic activity after the pandemic forecasts 30 billion reais ($5.5 billion) in public investment in infrastructure. Freitas spoke during a webcast hosted by  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA.
The licenses to operate 22 airports were initially expected to be auctioned this year, but private investors asked for a delay in the process to try to estimate future demand, he said. Now these auctions are expected for March 2021, according to the minister.
There will be a second phase with 21 airports, including some that have the highest traffic, which licenses will be auctioned in 2022.
Although current airports operators are asking for reductions in payments to the government due to the drastic drop in demand, Freitas said he expects the auctions to be successful.
Freitas also mentioned the abandoned deal between  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), saying the government is considering further measures to help the air transportation sector and indirectly help Embraer. Freitas mentioned the bailout to airlines  Azul SA  (N:AZUL),  Latam Airlines  Group SA (SN:LTM) and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4).
Freitas still hopes to auction the pulp export terminals at Santos, the largest port in Latin America, expected for August. He predicted an auction to operate the Fiol railway, in the northeastern state of Bahia will take place at the end of 2020, while Rumo SA (SA:RAIL3) is expected to renew its license to operate railway Malha Paulista on Wednesday.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",Nissan and Renault shelve merger plans to repair their alliance: sources,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Nissan (T:7201) have shelved plans to push towards the full merger former leader Carlos Ghosn craved and will instead fix their troubled alliance to try to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, five senior sources told Reuters. 
Nissan has long resisted Renault's proposals for a full-blown merger as executives felt the French carmaker was not paying its fair share for the engineering work it did in Japan, sowing discord that some feared could wreck the partnership.
Now, with carmakers around the world reeling from the pandemic, the partners are planning to overhaul an alliance that largely failed to convert its global scale into a competitive advantage beyond the joint procurement of parts.
Both struggling carmakers are set to announce mid-term restructuring plans this week that will serve as a peace treaty designed to resolve the long-standing tensions, the five people familiar with the overhaul told Reuters. 
""After the rain, the earth hardens,"" said one senior Nissan source, citing a popular Japanese proverb that means relationships become stronger after a period of strife.
All five sources within the alliance, which also includes Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak with media.
Nissan and Renault are each planning substantial restructuring and cost cuts that could affect tens of thousands of jobs, with the Japanese company to announce its measures on May 28 and its French partner likely to follow the next day.
Before that, Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault are holding a joint news conference on May 27 during which they are expected to outline the philosophy behind their new ""leader-follower"" approach to the alliance.
The sources said the companies were unlikely to disclose many details at the events this week of how the new approach will be used to share costs as the companies were still working on specific projects.
However, the crisis at both carmakers has accelerated efforts to resolve the disagreements that have stymied collaboration and cost-sharing in technology and product development for five years, the sources said.
Mitsubishi, Nissan and Renault all declined to comment officially about alliance plans.
'LEADER-FOLLOWER'
The alliance has steadily ramped up output over the years, delivering over 10 million vehicles for the first time in 2017, the first full year after Mitsubishi joined the partnership. 
But persistent quibbles over sharing the costs of innovation and new vehicle development soured relations and stalled plans to forge an even tighter alliance.
Nissan executives believe their engineers are substantially more productive than their Renault colleagues and the way the French carmaker proposed to combine technology and product development did not properly account for Nissan's intellectual property, three of the sources said. 
""Nissan engineers on average produced 40% more than their Renault counterparts in a given amount of time spent on a job,"" one insider told Reuters in January.
After his arrest in 2018 in Tokyo on charges of financial misconduct, former alliance head Ghosn said his detention was part of a plot by Nissan executives to bring him down and block any merger.
Earlier this year, relations looked strained to a point where the 21-year alliance was at risk of collapse.
However, the turnaround plans due are now likely to be combined to forge what the sources described as a more equitable way of sharing technology and resources, while preserving the distinctiveness of the alliance brands.
Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta and Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard are both key advocates of the new approach that they're calling a ""leader-follower"" system, the sources told Reuters.
The plan is for one company to lead the development of a type of vehicle or technology with the other following, taking a page out of the play-book Gupta used to revive Renault's commercial vehicle business, as well as reinvigorate Nissan's.
When he was in charge of the French business, Nissan used Renault's vehicle architectures as the building blocks for its city delivery vans while Nissan in turn provided the Renault group with technology for pickup trucks.
OFF THE TABLE
A test of the new approach could come in a several places around the world, such as how Renault and Nissan work together in Europe and perhaps South America, as well as how Nissan and Mitsubishi cooperate in Southeast Asia and Japan. 
Under the new working relationship, Nissan could take the lead in Europe on crossover sport-utility vehicles (SUVs), while operating as a ""follower"" in commercial vans and small city cars, using versions produced by Renault, the sources said.
Nissan's factory in Sunderland in the United Kingdom is of particular importance, they said.
Renault and Nissan are planning to turn the assembly plant into a hub for sport utility vehicles such as Nissan's Qashqai and Juke, and potentially their Renault counterparts, the Kadjar and Captur. The companies are working on the plans, though it's not clear when a final decision will be made, the sources said.
Whether Renault vehicles could be built profitably at the plant is unclear, given the uncertainty over tariffs as Britain leaves the European Union, according to one of the sources. 
""It should be a pure economic transaction, but it's also likely a political decision, too,"" he said.
In the Philippines, Mitsubishi will likely help make cars for Nissan as it already has a plant there while the two will beef up cooperation in Japan's micro mini car business, which makes up about half the country's passenger car market.
The latest effort to salvage the Renault-Nissan alliance comes at a time of rising global economic nationalism and protectionism that represent a risk to the partnership.
But for now, the new approach means the two companies will sideline any discussion of a complete merger, the sources said. Renault owns a 43.4% controlling stake in Nissan, which owns non-voting 15% stake in the French carmaker.

""Will merger talk be revived in the future? No one knows. Everybody has to be prepared for that. But as far as I know, it's not being pursued anymore,"" said one of the senior alliance sources. ""It is totally out of our sight today.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Air Canada 's (TO:AC) bid for Canadian tour operator  Transat AT Inc  (TO:TRZ) may result in higher prices and less choice for flights between Europe and Canada, EU antitrust regulators said on Monday as they opened a full-scale investigation into the deal.
Shares of Transat closed down about 7% at C$7 on Monday. 
Montreal-based Air Canada is hoping Transat will boost its leisure travel business and help it better compete with rival WestJet Airlines (TO:WJA).
The European Commission said the deal could significantly reduce competition on 33 routes between Europe and Canada.
The EU antitrust enforcer said other European airlines were just distant competitors and that WestJet was not a sufficiently strong rival.
""This is a challenging time, especially in markets severely impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, but a return to normal and healthy market conditions must be based on markets that remain competitive,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
Transat said in a statement that it was studying the commission's decision.
The company also said it had notified Air Canada that it intends to activate the first of the three one-month extensions of the outside date set for the deal, which is now postponed to July 27 from June 27. 
The deal is now expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020, Transat said. The company had initially said it anticipated the deal would close early this year.
Transat and Air Canada had declined to offer concessions to address the commission's concerns during the European Union's preliminary review of the deal. 

Regulators set a Sept. 30 deadline for their decision. The Canadian Competition Bureau in March also voiced concerns.

A first round of capital raising has yielded 3.2 billion euros from over 20 investors and another 1 billion euros in debt was raised for a fund known as LAC 1, Bpifrance said
French institutional investors include Covea,  Axa  (PA:AXAF), CNP Assurances,  BNP Paribas  Cardif (PA:BNPP), Generali (MI:GASI), Groupama, Groupe VYV,  Societe Generale  (OTC:SCGLY) Assurances (PA:SOGN), the Caisse des Dépôts,  Natixis  (PA:CNAT),  Aviva  France (L:AV),  Scor  (PA:SCOR), and CCR, as well as telecoms operator Orange (PA:ORAN) and the Unibel and Financière Dassault family offices.
Bpifrance and Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co had already indicated in February that they would invest one billion euros each in the fund.
Bpifrance has said it aims to eventually raise up to 10 billion euros for the fund, which aims to provide stable long-term investment in French companies adapting their business models or shareholder bases but also facing activist investor campaigns.
Bpifrance sought to drum up investment in the fund saying it would generate attractive yields by deploying capital in about 15 companies with a time horizon of 10 years.

Mexican officials in mid-May said the automotive industry could exit the coronavirus lockdown before June 1 if approved safety measures were in place.
The three Japanese firms have yet to announce official re-launch dates. Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and  Nissan Motor Co Ltd  told Reuters on Monday that they were preparing to gradually resume operations, and Honda Motor Co Ltd last Friday said it had begun a gradual return to operations.
Mexico has reported 68,620 total infections and 7,394 deaths since the pandemic reached the country in late February, prompting worries over re-opening the economy too soon. Last week the governor of Puebla state, home to major Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Audi (DE:NSUG) factories, said conditions ""do not exist"" for the auto industry to reopen.
U.S. auto part maker  Lear  Corp (N:LEA) asked 600 employees to report for work on Monday at its Rio Bravo plant in northern Mexico that supplies  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) and Ford (N:F), it said in a message to workers. The plant had been the site of a coronavirus outbreak that Lear said killed 18 workers.
The company told Reuters it was implementing safety protocols, but that no production had begun in any Mexican facility. 

Three Lear employees said they worked over the weekend at Rio Bravo. In a message directed at workers who had completed safety training, Lear offered a 300-peso ($13.30) bonus per 12-hour shift on Saturday and Sunday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) said on Monday it has created a new global financing team, a group that will span across divisions under one group in order to serve clients in a faster and simpler fashion. 
The new team will be led by Remi Mennesson, who will join the Swiss lender in November 2020, and report to the firm's four co-presidents, said a memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the bank. 
One of the reasons for the creation of the new team was to align employees working in global wealth management, investment bank financing and risk management under one umbrella. In addition, UBS said it will increase the bank's financing capabilities in the regions it operates and expand its product offering to meet the financing needs of all clients. 
""It is creating efficiency, so any type of lending, corporate derivatives or structured financing will now go through this one team. It is a global team that is able to really, in an organized way, meet all of our clients' needs on a local and global level,"" said UBS co-president of the investment bank Rob Karofsky. 
Mennesson joins UBS from  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) and previously worked at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 

The team will initially focus on corporate derivatives and structured solutions developed through the bank's Structured Equity Solutions Group and Special Situations Group.

1353,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",French billionaires raise stakes in defence of publisher Lagardere,"By Gwénaëlle Barzic and Dominique Vidalon
PARIS (Reuters) - France's business elite closed ranks around publishing group Lagardere (PA:LAGA) on Monday with LVMH's Bernard Arnault and  Vivendi 's (PA:VIV) Vincent Bollore swooping in to bolster its defences against London-based hedge fund Amber Capital.
Arnault, France's richest man, has bought a 25% stake in Lagardere Capital & Management (LCM), the personal holding company of Arnaud Lagardere, the heir of founder Jean-Luc Lagardere. The move shores up its finances after LCM's debts exceeded the value of its 7.3% stake in the Lagardere Group.
A source familiar with Arnault's purchase said it cost less than 100 million euros ($109 million) and was driven by his friendship with Jean-Luc Lagardere, who died in 2003.
Bollore's Vivendi, meanwhile, increased its stake in Lagardere SCA to 16.48% making it the second-largest shareholder after activist fund Amber Capital, which last month failed to shake up the so-called ""commandite"" governance structure, which concentrates power in the hands of Arnaud Lagardere.
Bernard Arnault and Arnaud Lagardere had told Vivendi about the move, a source close to Vivendi said.
""Vivendi welcomes Bernard Arnault's arrival very positively. It is a friendly approach and shows that he believes, like Vivendi, in the future of the Lagardere group's activities"", the source said.
Lagardere's business is focused on book publishing houses including Hachette, the world's third largest book publisher, and travel retail, with stores in airports and train stations.
Bollore already owned more than 13% of Lagardere SCA via Vivendi and analysts said that he and Arnault may be eying Lagardere's assets.
For Vivendi this could be media and entertainment assets and for Groupe Arnault, a partnership in travel retail, they said.
""The deal further reduces the likelihood that the “commandite” structure will be dismantled as it solves the potential solvency issue that Arnaud Lagardere was facing,"" Kepler Cheuvreux analysts wrote in a note.
""We believe Vivendi and Groupe Arnault will try to accelerate Lagardere’s refocusing strategy while eying some assets,"" the analysts said.
Shares in Lagardere closed up 16.15% at 13.02 euros.
Lagardere has been locked in a battle with Amber Capital for four years. The hedge fund has raised its stake in Lagardere to 18% in recent weeks, but Lagardere shareholders this month rejected the activist investor's call to replace Lagardere's supervisory board.
Amber declined to comment on Arnault and Vivendi's moves.
Lagardere has long been under fire for its sprawling business mix and for underperforming on the stock market. 
The link-up between Groupe Arnault and LCM will ""strengthen the corporate structure and financial capacities of LCM. The family groups led by Bernard Arnault and Arnaud Lagardere will act in concert with regard too Lagardere SCA,"" the statement said.

(Reuters) - Canadian banks, whose dividends yields climbed during the financial crisis, are again gaining favor with investors, as their pledges to maintain payouts gives them an edge over global counterparts who have shunned them. 
Canadian banks are currently offering dividend yields of 5.7% versus U.S. banks' 4.2% and European lenders' 1.7%, according to Datastream.
(GRAPHIC: Canada bank yields outstrip European, American rivals - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdpzqyndvw/Pasted%20image%201590422653409.png)
Dividends are seen as evidence of good financial health and encourage loyalty from investors, particularly in the current low-yield environment.
Canadian lenders have seen the smallest declines in share prices versus peers in Europe and the United States in the past three months.
(GRAPHIC: Canadian bank shares higher than international rivals - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopaknynpa/Pasted%20image%201590422235819.png)
""Globally, there continues to be a pursuit for yield … and there are simply not many places where you can get yield anymore,"" said Kash Pashootan, Chief Executive Officer of First Avenue Investment Counsel.
""That has forced investors into the dividend-generating equity realm ... Canadian banks are a natural beneficiary of that,"" he added. 
(GRAPHIC: Banks' dividend yield - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/rlgvdwbmypo/index.html)
SHARP CONTRAST
In contrast, top UK banks axed 2019 dividend payments after pressure from the regulator and are likely to review their plans for 2020.
Banks across the euro zone are also tearing up plans to return cash to shareholders.
In the United States, authorities have pushed for banks to preserve capital.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities analyst Ebrahim Poonawala pointed out that Canadian banks were one of the few developed market lenders to not cut dividends in 2008.
This was in part because of stronger balance sheets and capital levels, helped by conservative regulatory limits.
(GRAPHIC: Canadian banks' dividend - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xegvbkwgrpq/index.htmlon) 
Sprung Investment Management President Michael Sprung, however, argues that despite the higher payouts, the negative impact of exchange rates and the hit to the country's resources industry will keep demand from foreign investors in check.

""The Executive Board also supports the package"", Lufthansa said, adding that the bailout still need consent from shareholders as well as the European Commission.
The bailout comprises an equity injection by the government, which will take a 20% stake by buying new shares at the nominal value of 2.56 euros apiece or for a total of about 300 million euros. The WSF plans to sell its shareholding by end-2023.
Separately, the WSF will make a capital contribution of 5.7 billion euros in the form of a so-called silent stake, which is unlimited in duration and can be terminated by company on a quarterly basis in whole or in part.
A part of that silent stake can be swapped into an additional 5% equity stake if Lufthansa does not pay the coupon or Germany moves to protect Lufthansa against a takeover.
The coupon on the silent participation starts with 4% and rises to 9.5% by 2027.

""This is when the general management will formalize what it calls a 2 billion (euro) cost-cutting plan, in which further staff reductions and even site closures can be expected,"" CGT representative Fabien Gache said in a video posted online.

The French carmaker, which last year posted its first loss in 10 years, is expected to detail a drastic three-year savings plan at the end of the week.
Renault, which has been in a carmaking alliance with Japanese group Nissan (T:7201) for the past two decades, was rocked by the November 2018 arrest of the alliance's architect and long-time boss Carlos Ghosn on charges of financial misconduct. Ghosn denies the charges.
The company has also suffered declining sales in key markets even before the coronavirus pandemic hammered demand for vehicles and threw production into disarray.

LONDON (Reuters) - Stocks gained modestly on Monday after a survey showed German business morale rebounded in May, while investors kept a close eye on escalating U.S.-China tensions in a thin trading session.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s gauge of world stocks gained 0.4%, nearing a 2-1/2 month high. The pan-European STOXX 600 index and U.S. stock futures were up around 1% each. 
Lockdown measures introduced in mid-March have put the global economy on track for a recession this year. Only unprecedented stimulus by global central banks has held up world markets in recent weeks.
With nervous investors wary of adding to their equity holdings over concerns on what a post-lockdown world would look like, Germany's Ifo institute survey for May gave some relief.
The index rebounded more than a Reuters poll expected in May, recovering from its worst decline on record in April as a reopening of Europe's largest economy boosted corporate expectations.
""The low point of the slump should now be behind us and there even is the chance for a short-lived strong rebound in the coming months,"" ING economists told clients.
But analysts voiced caution, given the uncertainty ahead from the pandemic, with Ifo itself still expecting a double-digit contraction in Europe's largest economy in the second quarter.
""We shouldn't probably overemphasize the data because we have so much distortions from the coronavirus,"" said Jens Peter Sorensen, chief strategist at Danske Bank in Copenhagen, referring to difficulties survey respondents may face in evaluating the impact of the pandemic on economic indicators. 
More optimism came from Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted the state of emergency for Tokyo and four remaining areas on Monday - although he warned that it could be reimposed if the new coronavirus started spreading again. 
The government is also considering fresh stimulus worth 100 trillion yen ($930 billion).
But with financial markets in Singapore, Britain and the United States closed for public holidays on Monday, market moves were relatively small and held within well-worn ranges.
CHINA-U.S. TENSIONS
Stock markets were also set to make gains despite signs of renewed strains in Sino-U.S. relations over the weekend. China's move to impose a a new security law on Hong Kong has heightened concerns about the stability of the city and global trade prospects, and upset the United States.
The dollar, which tends to behave like a safe-haven asset during market turmoil and political uncertainty, touched a one-week high against its rivals in earlier trading, but erased gains in late London trading.
Ties between the two countries have deteriorated since the coronavirus outbreak, over which they have exchanged accusations of cover-ups and a lack of transparency.
""Rising tensions between the U.S. and China around Hong Kong, trade policy and who is responsible for the 2020 economic dislocation are threatening to end the post March-trough rally,"" said Perpetual analyst Matthew Sherwood.
Italian bonds showed little reaction to an expected counter-proposal from more hawkish states to France and Germany's 500 billion euro recovery fund proposal, holding near six-week lows hit on Friday. 
The euro steadied around the $1.09 levels, recovering from earlier losses, as the focus shifted to a proposal the European Commission is expected to put forward on Wednesday. 
Oil prices, which had been driven higher for the past four weeks, were steady on Monday, with U.S. crude oil up 0.75% to $33.49 a barrell and Brent up around 0.2% to $35.21

Spot gold was off 0.3% at $1,728.1 an ounce.

KARLSRUHE, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) must pay compensation to owners of vehicles with rigged diesel engines in Germany, a court ruled on Monday, dealing a fresh blow to the automaker almost five years after its emissions scandal erupted.
The ruling by Germany's highest court for civil disputes, which will allow owners to return vehicles for a partial refund of the purchase price, serves as a template for about 60,000 lawsuits that are still pending with lower German courts.
Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to cheating emissions tests on diesel engines, a scandal which has already cost it more than 30 billion euros ($33 billion) in regulatory fines and vehicle refits, mostly in the United States. 
U.S. authorities banned the affected cars after the cheat software was discovered, triggering claims for compensation.
But in Europe vehicles remained on the roads, leading Volkswagen to argue compensation claims there were without merit. European authorities instead forced the company to update its engine control software and fined it for fraud and administrative lapses.
Volkswagen said on Monday it would work urgently with motorists on an agreement that would see them hold on to the vehicles for a one-off compensation payment.
It did not give an estimate of how much the ruling by the German federal court, the Bundesgerichtshof (BGH), might cost it. 
Volkswagen shares were 0.5% lower at 1040 GMT. The BGH's presiding judge had signalled earlier this month he saw grounds for compensation. 
COSTS MOUNT
""The verdict by the BGH draws a final line. It creates clarity on the BGH's views on the underlying questions in the diesel proceedings for most of the 60,000 cases still pending,"" Volkswagen said. 
A lower court in the city of Koblenz had previously ruled the owner of a VW Sharan minivan had suffered pre-meditated damage, entitling him to reimbursement minus a discount for the mileage the motorist had already benefited from.
The court at the time said he should be awarded 25,600 euros for the used-car purchase he made for 31,500 euros in 2014.
""We have in principle confirmed the verdict from the Koblenz upper regional court,"" said BGH presiding federal judge Stephan Seiters. 
Volkswagen had petitioned for the ruling to be quashed altogether by the higher court, while the plaintiff had appealed to have the deduction removed.
A Volkswagen spokesman said that outside Germany, more than 100,000 claims for damages were still pending, of which 90,000 cases were in Britain. 
The carmaker also said it had paid out a total of 750 million euros to more than 200,000 separate claimants in Germany who had opted against individual claims and instead joined a class action lawsuit brought by a German consumer group.
The carmaker said last month it would set aside a total of 830 million for that deal.
In a separate court, Volkswagen agreed last week to pay 9 million euros to end proceedings against its chairman and chief executive, who were accused of withholding market-moving information before the emissions scandal came to light.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",Investing in Spanish Nissan factory cheaper than closing it: Spanish official,"By Isla Binnie
(Reuters) - Nissan Motor (T:7201) would find it cheaper to invest in its Barcelona factory than to close it, a senior Spanish industry ministry official said on Monday, pegging the estimated cost of a shutdown at more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). 
Europe has long been a difficult market for automakers due to overcapacity, stiff competition and tight regulations, and economic shutdowns to stem the spread of the coronavirus have piled on more pressure. 
People with knowledge of the matter have told Reuters Nissan may be considering closing its factory in northeastern Spain, but has made no decision yet. 
Spain's secretary for industry, Raul Blanco, said he had received no official confirmation of Nissan's plans for the plant, which along with related facilities in the area employs 3,000 people. The company is due to unveil a strategy update this week.
""It is much cheaper to invest than to leave,"" Blanco said, adding it would cost the company more than 1 billion euros to settle labour and contractual issues in closing what would be its last facility in Europe outside of Britain.
The factory needs around 300 million euros in what he said was overdue investment.
""The situation is very difficult and we have to be realistic,"" Blanco told reporters on a conference call. ""Nissan has not invested in the plant for 10 years.""
Referring to any potential closure, he said: ""This is not a friendly situation.""
The automotive industry accounts for around 10% of Spain's economic output, according to government trade and investment body ICEX. 
""The plant's situation has worsened but it is fully competitive if it is put to work and the right investments are made for the next 10 years,"" Blanco said.

1363,By Investing.com,"<span>May 25, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Vamos a la Playa (Lockdown is Over),"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The scent of post-pandemic freedom is in the air again, which must mean it’s time to buy tourism stocks.
Melia Hotels (MC:MEL) stock leaped over 24% on Monday as Spain’s biggest hotel operator rejoiced at Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s announcement on Saturday that the country will reopen its hotels to tourists from July.
“Spain needs tourism, and tourism needs safety in both origin and destination. We will guarantee that tourists will not run any risks, nor will they bring any risk to our country,” Sanchez said. ““We’re sending everyone a message today: Spain will be waiting for you from July.”
Melia stock still has plenty of room to recover further: the shares are still down by nearly half from January and trading at barely a third of their level of two years ago, before the U.S.-China trade war hit the eurozone economy.  
International Consolidated Airlines Group (MC:ICAG) (LON:ICAG), the parent company of Spain’s Iberia and Vueling, also shot up by over 10%, while airport operator Aena (MC:AENA) rose 5.7% and  Amadeus  (MC:AMA), a software company that primarily serves the travel industry, rose 5.5%.
Spain was forced to impose the tightest lockdown regime in Europe, alongside Italy. Like much of the continent, it was slow to recognize the speed and extent of the coronavirus’ spread, and the pandemic threatened to hit its economy harder than most other countries in the region, due to the disproportionate effect it has had on the travel and tourism sector. Tourism accounts for around 11% of Spanish GDP, compared to some 4% the European Union as a whole.
Spain’s announcement has electrified the whole European travel sector:  Flughafen  Wien AG (VIE:VIEV), the operator of Vienna airport, rose over 10% on the hopes that the Austrian summer season might yet be saved (even though it depends mostly on Germans who arrive by car), while Frankfurt airport operator  Fraport  's (DE:FRAG) stock rose 7.6% (helped also by the partial resumption of Lufthansa flights announced at the weekend) and Aeroports de Paris SA (PA:ADP) stock rose 4.4%. Tour operator Tui (DE:TUIGn) stock rose 11.7% in Germany, while Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) rose 9.4%. The benchmark Stoxx 600 was up 0.8%, while Spain's IBEX 35 rose 1.7%.
The big question now is - how many people will be confident enough to risk the flight, the confined spaces of the hotel and the proximity of other holidaymakers?   And will the likes of Tui, which announced 8,000 job cuts two weeks ago in response to the collapse in demand, have enough resources in the right places to ensure that they benefit from a season that had already been written off (Tui in its full-year results pointedly referred only to bookings for the coming winter season)?
Either way, anything that the industry can salvage from here should be a bonus, given the apocalyptic expectations currently baked into prices.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>",Australia gives companies a six-month break from earnings forecasts,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will relax its company disclosure obligations for six months, including allowing firms to hold off on earnings forecasts in a move to protect them from lawsuits during the coronavirus crisis. 
The move is the second intervention by the government to clamp down on the booming class-action industry, with Treasurer Josh Frydenberg last week introducing tighter regulations on litigation funders.
""The heightened level of uncertainty around companies' future prospects as a result of the crisis also exposes companies to the threat of opportunistic class actions for allegedly falling foul of their continuous disclosure obligations if their forecasts are found to be inaccurate,"" Frydenberg said in a statement. 
The government will temporarily amend corporate laws so that from May 26 and for six months, companies and their officers would only be legally liable for market statements if there had been knowledge, recklessness or negligence.
""In response, companies may hold back from making forecasts of future earnings or other forward-looking estimates, limiting the amount of information available to investors during this period,"" Frydenberg said. 
The changes will ""make it harder to bring such actions against companies and officers' during the coronavirus crisis,"" he added.
The class action industry in Australia had a later start than in the United States but has grown quickly since legal changes allowed for such lawsuits in 1992, helped by a favourable regulatory environment. 
The government's move to introduce greater regulatory oversight for litigation funders last Friday came on the same day that it unveiled a A$60 billion ($39 billion) error in its own estimates of how much wage subsidies would cost the nation.

1368,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 25, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>","Stocks May Climb Anew, and Virus Could Prove Boost, Jen Says","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stocks could see another leg to their rebound rally this year, and investors ought to consider the potential for positive long-run economic implications from the coronavirus outbreak, veteran analyst Stephen Jen said.
“I am hesitant to project an overly confident positive view on equities” when a legendary investor like Stanley Druckenmiller is bearish, Jen, who runs hedge fund and advisory firm Eurizon SLJ Capital in London, wrote in a note Sunday. Even so, “it seems to me that there are many reasons to expect U.S. equities to end the year meaningfully higher than they are now.”
Jen’s key assumption is effective therapies and vaccines emerging within a few months. He also sees an economic rebound, boosted in part by the power of U.S. fiscal “multipliers” -- where each $1 of government outlays generates more than that amount in growth. With American household wealth largely intact, consumers could be more likely to spend than save the fiscal help they get, Jen indicated.
Over the longer term, while some market participants have focused on the risks of structural drags on growth, and their potential impact on corporate earnings and stock prices, Jen sees the possibility of positive effects.
“The heightened state of emotions in the U.S. to defeat this virus” may have wider implications for policymaking going forward, he wrote. “I expect sustained efforts at scientific research, large spending on healthcare, and organizational changes to the state and federal governments be made to prepare the U.S. for similar shocks.”
“The U.S. economy remaining in an open-ended hobbled state” is unlikely, he added.
Big Projects
Comments over the weekend from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo may hint at some of the potential Jen is alluding to. Cuomo said that simply returning to pre-coronavirus activity levels will be inadequate.
“I don’t believe it is going to be enough just to go back to where the economy was,” he said. Government will need to stimulate the economy by getting “some big projects going,” such as building a new airport, Cuomo said.
Greater efforts at addressing income and wealth inequalities may be one consequence of the crisis, according to Jen, and not just in the U.S.
“I expect the world to be more competitive and the aggregate productivity growth to be higher than in the past 20 years,” he wrote. “Investors ought to consider this pandemic being the trigger for sustained policy reorientations in many countries in the coming years, in areas unrelated to the pandemic.”

1370,By Investing.com,"<span>May 25, 2020 01:30AM ET</span>",Alibaba Sees Stocks Slide After Projecting Slow Growth,"By Gina Lee
Investing.com –  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding (HK:9988) saw its shares slide after projecting slow revenue growth in 2020.
The Chinese e-commerce giant forecast sales growth of around 27.5% to CNY 650 billion ($91.1462 billion) for the year on Monday, below analyst estimates and down from the previous sales growth of 35%.
Meanwhile, rival JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) forecast better-than-expected results for the second quarter.
The company has lost more than $70 billion of its market value since the virus outbreak in January. It posted a March quarter revenue of CNY 114.3 billion. Although the revenue beat expectations, it was Alibaba’s slowest pace of expansion since records started.
The slowing growth reflects a tepid outlook for China’s economic recovery from the economic impact of COVID-19 and added to fears of ever-escalating U.S.-China tensions.
China formally tabled new national security laws for Hong Kong and Macau at the opening session of the National People’s Congress on Friday, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening strong action should the laws be enacted. The news triggered protests in Hong Kong on Sunday, with police firing tear gas and a water cannon.
Chinese foreign Minister Wang Yi warned that the U.S. was edging towards a “new Cold War” with China on Sunday.
Taiwan, an ongoing spat about the origins of COVID-19 and Hong Kong are issues ramping up tensions between the two countries, threatening to derail a hard-fought phase one trade deal and further contributing to Alibaba’s slow revenue growth.

The administrators at Deloitte are not paying aircraft and engine lessors but have asked them to sign standstill agreements to refrain from repossession to let the buyer decide on the future fleet, showed the affidavit published by the Federal Court of Australia on Monday.
Lessors would normally be able to repossess planes from June 19, which is 60 calendar days after the appointment of administrators.
But the coronavirus pandemic has decimated travel demand, giving lessors few alternative options for placing the planes.
""Negotiations with the Aircraft Lessors have been advanced to the point where an indicative in-principle agreement has been reached with lessors representing the vast majority of the Virgin Companies' fleet which are subject to lease or financing arrangements,"" administrator Salvatore Algeri said.
Bain Capital and Indigo Partners have confirmed they are among parties looking to buy Australia's second-biggest airline, which entered voluntary administration last month owing nearly A$7 billion ($4.57 billion).
BGH Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners have also been shortlisted, people with knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters.
Binding offers will be required from a smaller set of short-listed candidates by June 12 and a sale could be approved at a creditors' meeting in August, the administrators have said.
The bidders have not publicly revealed plans for the fleet but the winning party will be responsible for negotiating with lessors about whether to keep some or all aircraft, potentially on altered contract terms, the Deloitte documents showed.
Virgin Australia has a monthly rental liability of A$40 million for the 117 leased aircraft and engines in its fleet, but is only bringing in A$25 million of monthly revenue due to the collapse in demand, the documents showed.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Monday morning, with investors digesting an escalation of U.S.-China tensions after protestors took to the streets in Hong Kong on Sunday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.39% by 10:55 PM ET (3:55 AM GMT). Thousands participated in Sunday’s protests after China formally proposed new national security laws on Friday during the opening session of the National People’s Congress. Police fired tear gas and a water cannon in the shopping area of Causeway Bay to curb the assembly.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned that the U.S. was potentially pushing toward “a new Cold War” with China after U.S President Donald Trump promised strong U.S. action if the laws are passed. Two U.S. Senators proposed sanctions on entities enforcing the law and the U.S. Commerce Department added 33 Chinese companies and institutions to a blacklist on Friday.
“Risk sentiment proved resilient, on Friday night, to concerns about the fallout from China introducing national security legislation in Hong Kong. Weakness in Asian equities gave way to a flattish European session, and mild positivity in the US,” Hayden Dimes at ANZ Research said in a Monday morning note.
But outside of the Greater China area, markets remained bullish and equities were 30% higher than their March lows, with various stimuli measures kicking in and lower cases numbers in some countries prompting loosened lockdown measures, prompting hopes of a swift economic recovery.
“One big threat to the recovery in markets is the escalating war of words between the U.S. and China,” Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Investors, told Bloomberg.
“The main focus will likely remain on continuing evidence that the number of new COVID-19 cases is slowing in developed countries, progress towards medical solutions, the reopening of economies and signs that economic activity is picking up.”
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.07% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.36%. Investors will continue to monitor developments during the week from the National People’s Congress.
Meanwhile, the ASX 200 led the gains as it rose 1.40%. South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.50% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1.23%. The Japanese government is considering lifting its state of emergency in Tokyo later in the day."

Its stock slid as much as 4% in Hong Kong Monday, after a drop of almost 6% in New York before the weekend. The e-commerce giant forecast sales growth this year of at least 27.5% to more than 650 billion yuan ($91 billion), down from 35% previously and slightly below analysts’ estimates. While it posted a better-than-expected 22% rise in March quarter revenue of 114.3 billion yuan, that marked its slowest pace of expansion on record.
Online shopping began to bounce back from March, executives said Friday. But the tepid outlook demonstrates the world’s second-largest economy has yet to fully shake off Covid-19, with consumers still hesitant about spending on big-ticket items. Asia’s most valuable corporation is tackling also the rise of rivals such as ByteDance Ltd. and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. And the Tmall operator is going head-to-head with Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. for internet leadership in everything from online media to payments and cloud computing. JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc., the No. 2 Chinese online retailer, forecast better-than-expected revenue this quarter.
“The market is a bit disappointed despite the strength given 2Q guidance of 20-30% YoY growth for JD and 99% GMV growth in 1Q20 for PDD,” CICC analyst Natalie Wu wrote. “We regard Alibaba’s advantage as a market leader as intact and unchanged in the longer run, though it may take several quarters for market sentiment to swing back.”

Alibaba has lost more than $70 billion of market value since the coronavirus first erupted in January, and now has to grapple with not just an uncertain global economic environment but also any potential fallout from U.S.-Chinese financial tensions. On Friday, executives sought to assuage concerns about a U.S. bill that mandates much closer accounting scrutiny of U.S.-listed Chinese companies and may bar them from American bourses.
Chief Financial Officer Maggie Wu said Friday Alibaba’s financial statements have been consistently prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP accounting measures and were beyond reproach. “The integrity of Alibaba’s financial statements speak for itself, we have been an SEC filer since 2014 and hold ourselves to the highest standard,” she told analysts on a conference call. “We will endeavor to comply with any legislation whose aim is to protect and bring transparency to investors who buy securities on U.S. stock exchanges.”
The bigger short-term challenge is in reviving growth: Alibaba’s bread-and-butter customer management or marketing business grew just 3% in the March quarter. Much of that stems from weaker consumer sentiment during the coronavirus-stricken quarter, when total Chinese e-commerce rose just 5.9% or at less than a third of 2019’s pace, according to government data. Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analysts led by Thomas Chong wrote that Alibaba’s guidance was in fact a positive when viewed against an array of uncertainties gripping the post-Covid 19 global economic environment.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
User engagement and transaction volume have rebounded in April and May to precrisis levels, which bodes well for normalized sales growth ahead, especially as merchant-support measures are gradually rolled back.

Rival PDD posted a revenue rise of 44% on Friday, down sharply from 91% in the previous quarter but ahead of expectations. Its sales and marketing expenses jumped 49%. PDD’s shares climbed 15% Friday.
Alibaba’s March-quarter net income was 3.2 billion yuan, down 88% from a year ago when it booked an 18.7 billion yuan one-time gain on investments. In February, Alibaba declared a waiver of some service fees for merchants struggling financially during the outbreak on its main direct-to-consumer Tmall platform. In April, the company rolled out a new 10-billion-yuan subsidy program for Tmall users to buy electronics, encroaching on JD.com’s traditional turf. These initiatives may further compress margins for the June quarter.
“The challenging part is for them to achieve the same amount of growth this year,” said Steven Zhu, a Shanghai-based analyst with Pacific Epoch. “Just because they are too big, for the same amount of growth, they need to spend much more effort.”
But executives were confident in a gradual e-commerce recovery over the year. Beyond its main business, younger divisions such as its cloud computing arm should buoy the bottom line. That division’s revenue jumped 58% in the quarter.
“Despite a challenging quarter due to reduced economic activities in light of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, we achieved our annual revenue guidance,” Wu said in a statement. “Although the pandemic negatively impacted most of our domestic core commerce businesses starting in late January, we have seen a steady recovery since March.”

The Melbourne-based firm was sued in April 2019 by shareholders who alleged the company engaged in deceptive conduct and breached stock market disclosure obligations.
The suit was filed in the New South Wales Supreme Court in Sydney by law firm Quinn Emmanuel.
The class-action lawsuit was among many filed against financial firms after a public inquiry in 2018 - dubbed the Royal Commission - uncovered widespread misconduct in the finance industry, including charging customers for service not rendered and the deception of regulators.
IOOF said it would make no payments to the plaintiffs, their lawyers, financial backers or any other members of the class action as part of the settlement. It did not provide details on how the agreement was reached.
Quinn Emmanuel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Shares of IOOF rose as much as 5.5% to a two-week high of A$4.570, against a 1.7% rise in the broader market (AXJO).
The agreement brings additional relief to IOOF, which was among the worst affected by the Royal Commission inquiry.
In September, the banking watchdog lost a landmark case after a court ruled it had not proved its case alleging the wealth manager had breached pension law.
By that time, the firm had lost half its market value and suffered the departure of its top executives.

Tokyo reported 14 new coronavirus cases Sunday, the highest since May 16, after just two cases were confirmed on Saturday. The total for the past seven days is 50, below the threshold of 70, or 0.5 people per 100,000, which the government has outlined as being needed to lift the emergency.
Abe declared an emergency in the capital and some other areas from April 7, later expanding it nationwide. From mid-May he began lifting it in places where the rate of new infections subsided. The Tokyo region -- the worst-hit by the virus -- was the final and largest site of infection.
Tokyo, with its surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama, has a combined population of about 35 million people and an annual output of 182.2 trillion yen ($1.7 trillion), which in global terms would make it the 11th largest economy on the planet.
While a European-style lock down isn’t legally possible in Japan, the state of emergency enabled local governments to instruct businesses to close or operate for shortened hours, and to ask residents to stay at home.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has laid out guidelines for reopening the economy as people gradually resume activities kept on hold for almost seven weeks. Neighboring South Korea has already seen a major cluster spread among nightclub-goers after loosening restrictions. Meanwhile, Abe has vowed to work with regional governments to prepare for a second wave of infections that experts say is almost inevitable.
While Japan has suffered far fewer coronavirus infections and deaths than any of its Group of Seven peers, Abe’s handling of the outbreak has reinforced concerns that his government has grown complacent after seven years in power. He has been criticized for delaying an emergency declaration when local cases began to surge and for being slow to close Japan’s borders to Chinese visitors.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>","In China's auto market, worries grow that cashback deals and gifts presage damaging price war","By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
HANGZHOU, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Cashback offers, up to 10 free oil changes, generous prepaid gasoline cards - these are just some of the giveaways China's auto dealerships are using to woo customers out and about after spending much of February and March in lockdown.
For the most part, they are getting the job done.
Cui Peng, a Geely (HK:0175) sales manager in the eastern city of Hangzhou, says unit sales at his dealership jumped 30% in April from March and they are hoping for 25% growth in May.
That is partly due to delayed demand after China shut down to contain the coronavirus. But it is also thanks to an offer of six free engine oil changes, worth around 3,000 yuan ($420), for customers who buy models such as the Binyue sport utility vehicle.
""Although car retail prices are not much different from usual, customers get to enjoy these complimentary services that do not impact our budget much in the short term,"" he said.
In the nearby city of Ningbo, a Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) dealership offering 10 free oil changes saw April vehicle sales return to pre-virus levels and is aiming for sales in May to climb 10% month-on-month, its marketing manager Chen Xiaotian told Reuters.
Even some luxury brands were offering deals, with one Lexus store in Hangzhou enticing customers with thousands of yuan in cashbacks.
Visits and phone calls by Reuters to dozens of dealerships in the world's biggest auto market showed most have notched up double-digit percentage jumps in unit sales for April compared to March and many expect May sales to grow at least another 10%.
Their efforts helped China log its first positive growth in vehicle sales in nearly two years, up 4.4% in April from the same month a year earlier.
But the industry remains deeply worried. Any momentum from demand that was locked up in February and March is expected to peter out by the end of May. After that, the outlook for consumer spending is bleak as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hammer the global economy, including China's exports.
Moreover, industry executives believe the generous deals currently being offered to customers are priming the market for a return to price wars.
Feng Xingya, general manager of state-owned automaker GAC (SS:601238) which has partnerships with Toyota and Honda Motor Co (T:7267), believes a bruising price war is on the cards.
""When there is not much demand amid a pickup in production, price competition will obviously increase,"" he told an investor conference in April, adding GAC ""cannot be afraid of or refuse to enter any price war.""
Slipping back into price war mode would be easy enough in a crowded market where pandemic-hit automakers are desperate to gain what sales they can.
The industry has already been there twice in the recent past. In 2018, sticker prices took a hit as China's auto market began to weaken after two decades of strong growth while in mid-2019, dealers offered big incentives after the chaotic implementation of new emissions standards.
""Offering gifts and cashbacks suggests a lack of substantial customer demand,"" said Alan Kang, a senior LMC Automotive analyst, adding more brands could offer incentives across more segments to maintain market share.
Kang believes China auto sales will be either flat or show slight growth in the second half of this year.
Dealers noted customers had recently become far more price sensitive.
""We are repeatedly asked by customers about whether Hangzhou will roll out policies to support car demand such as subsidies,"" said Avery Wu, marketing manager at a Hangzhou-based Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) dealership.

She added some customers were holding off on purchases in the belief that such subsidies will be forthcoming.

1378,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2020 07:09PM ET</span>",China’s $941 Billion Sovereign Fund Seeks More Resilient Assets,"(Bloomberg) -- China Investment Corp. is looking for more resilient assets in markets battered by the coronavirus pandemic as the nation’s $941 billion sovereign wealth fund seeks to boost long-term returns, Executive Vice President Zhao Haiying said.
The Beijing-based company added to its investments in credit markets in recent months, especially investment-grade loans in the U.S., after the Federal Reserve eased a liquidity crunch, Zhao said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Saturday. CIC, as the fund is known, also bolstered holdings in healthcare and information technology stocks and added exposure in regions like Asia where there was “less uncertainty” about the spread of the virus, she said.
CIC, led by Chairman Peng Chun, is finetuning its investment strategies. It sees a diversified portfolio as the best way to weather its biggest test since inception in 2007. A plan to boost alternative and direct investments to 50% of global assets by the end of 2022 remains unchanged, with the private portfolio, which includes real estate and private equity, avoiding any “serious damage” even as cash flows slow, Zhao said.
“As a long-term investor, we want to invest in growth,” Zhao said in Beijing. “Given the many external shocks, you need to be more focused on the more resilient areas, strategies and themes, and avoid fragile areas.”
Hedge-Fund Allocations
CIC’s overseas investments returned about 17% last year based on unaudited results, she said, as global stocks rallied. That comes close to a record 17.6% gain in 2017 and reverses a loss in 2018 when equities tumbled.
The pandemic and the collapse in global oil markets have caused more serious disruptions to other sovereign wealth funds. Norway, for example, is planning to draw a record 382 billion kroner ($38.2 billion) from its wealth fund, forcing the world’s largest sovereign investor to embark on a historic asset sale to generate cash.
Although CIC doesn’t have big annual expenditure needs, the firm checked on its liquidity requirements early in the year to maintain its position as a long-term investor, such as the ability to meet capital calls, Zhao said. CIC’s derivatives investments avoided the liquidity squeeze seen in some other complex products, she said.
While the steep declines in global equity markets earlier in 2020 made stocks the hardest hit asset class for many investors, there has since been a “very good rebound,” Zhao said. Fixed-income investments helped mitigate volatility in equities, and CIC’s hedge-fund allocations, among the world’s largest, also played a “positive role” in absorbing the market impact.
Little Tilt
Zhao said the situation is less stable in emerging markets. She called for more cooperation among governments and cautioned against policy missteps, citing rising geopolitical tensions and long-term issues like debt burdens.
“The liquidity crisis may be over and the darkest may be behind us,” she said. “But we must be very careful to avoid going back to the ICU.”
CIC’s asset allocation strategies have been kept largely stable this year but the company did “tilt a little bit” to avoid excessive short-term volatility and “permanent losses,” Zhao said, without elaborating.
“Being a long-term investor doesn’t mean ignoring short-term volatility,” she said. “It’s like riding a bicycle -- you need to look both right in front you and 10 meters ahead.”

1379,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Hong Kong’s IPO Momentum Is Now Clouded by Political Turmoil,"(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong’s stock exchange was having a good week until Beijing crashed the party.
Seen as one of the potential big winners from a bill last week by the U.S. Senate to limit listings of Chinese companies, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. now faces what could be an even more rocky year than 2019, when political unrest cooled trading and brought revenue growth to a near standstill.
The bourse’s shares on Friday had their biggest tumble in a year as investors absorbed Beijing’s proposal to impose security legislation on the semi-autonomous city. Besides potentially sparking more protests, the bill raises uncertainty over the city’s status as a financial hub, stirring doubts about the prospects of foreign investments and fears of capital flight.
The planned crackdown adds peril for Chief Executive Officer Charles Li’s vision for the exchange to become a gateway to China, just as his plan was starting to gain momentum. Li has pushed through a number of changes to lure more of China’s corporate giants to list in the city, away from New York. The U.S. Senate bill unveiled last week was seen as adding further momentum to the push.
Before Friday “it was clear that the U.S.-listed Chinese companies could come back and raise funds in Hong Kong,” said Castor Pang, head of research at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International Hong Kong. “Now frankly no one can be so sure.”
Reforms over the past years have allowed the exchange to attract Chinese tech behemoth  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Holdings Inc. to do a $13 billion dual listing last year. Companies such as JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc. are planning to follow suit next month.
Further optimism was stoked last week by changes to the city’s benchmark Hang Seng index to include China’s corporate giants and a move by Nasdaq Inc. to clamp down on Chinese listings.
The big question now is over the fallout of the Chinese security bill, in particular if it will impact the movement of capital, and any potential U.S. blow back.
President Donald Trump said Thursday that the U.S. will “address very strongly” any crackdown, while two senators proposed a bill that would sanction enforcers of the proposed law. The U.S. has also delayed an annual report on Hong Kong’s special status, further threatening the city’s economy.
Hong Kong is for now still seen as largely insulated from the U.S.-China turmoil and has the proper legal framework to protect investors’ rights, said Louis Tse, a Hong Kong-based managing director of VC Brokerage Ltd. Maintaining that confidence will be key since the bourse will need major institutional investors in Europe and the U.S. to take part in big IPOs returning from New York, Tse said.
“There will be measures to soothe the harm done to the Hong Kong market,” he said. “One doesn’t kill the goose that lays the golden eggs, right?”

1380,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>","Aston Martin chief to leave, Mercedes-AMG CEO to replace him: source","By Edward Taylor and Aishwarya Nair
(Reuters) -  Aston Martin  (L:AML) Chief Executive Andy Palmer is leaving the business as part of a management shake-up and will be replaced by Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
The luxury carmaker said in an emailed statement that it is reviewing its management team but declined to comment on Palmer's fate.
Palmer and Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), which owns a 5% stake in Aston Martin and supplies the carmaker with Mercedes-AMG engines, also declined to comment.
The Financial Times newspaper had reported earlier that the Aston Martin chief was going to leave as part of a shake-up of its leadership, with an official announcement expected on Tuesday.
Palmer had not been informed of the upcoming announcement, the newspaper reported. 
Aston Martin, famed for being fictional secret agent James Bond's car of choice, has seen its share price plummet since floating in October 2018.
The 107-year old British luxury carmaker earlier this month posted a deep first-quarter loss after sales dropped by almost a third due to the impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
The company has been banking on its sport utility vehicle to drive sales in a new segment, and said production was on track. 
In January, dire conditions forced the company to bring in Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll who bought a roughly 20% stake for nearly 200 million pounds ($263 million), as the ailing carmaker sought to raise funds. 
The coronavirus pandemic and shutdowns caused by it have hit demand and forced factories around the world to suspend production, negatively impacting many industries, including car manufacturers. 

""We were obviously fairly significantly hit by COVID-19, starting with China in January but more clearly in what we saw as it came across towards Europe and the United States,"" Palmer told Reuters earlier in May.

Companies from the steel, aviation and aerospace sectors are among those facing acute problems and the offer of the Treasury will apply across all sectors of the economy, according to the newspaper.
Sunak's allies cited by FT said the Treasury will not initially look at taking equity stakes in companies that are struggling, with the preferred option being extension of loans.
However, the Treasury told the newspaper that it may consider support on a ""last resort basis"" in ""exceptional circumstances.

For the first quarter of 2020, China's commercial banks realized net profits of 600.1 billion yuan ($84.2 billion), up 5% year-on-year, mainly due to the expansion of banks' assets and lower management costs, according to an article by the research bureau of the People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY). 
The possibility could not be ruled out that banks could log zero or even negative profit growth within 2020, due to mounting bad loans and a fast draining of cash buffers, as the difficulties in the real economy spills over into the financial area, the PBOC warned in the article. 
China's banks need to further support the real economy which faces various challenges due to the coronavirus outbreak, in particular small and micro enterprises, as there is some room for banks to surrender part of their healthy profits, the article said. 
In an effort to cushion the economy, small and midsize companies can delay paying loans and interest by a further nine months, through March 2021, and lending to SMEs by big commercial banks should grow more than 40%, Premier Li Keqiang said Friday.
In March, China's largest state banks said the impact of restrictions on movement imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus could pull down asset quality as borrowers struggle to repay loans.

Bain said in a statement it was ""preparing a second-round proposal to become the owner and operator of Virgin Australia ... with a long-term mindset and commitment to a well-funded, successful airline"".
The private equity firm is one of four parties shortlisted by administrators to buy Virgin Australia, Reuters has reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The others are Indigo Partners, BGH Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners. 
Binding offers for Australia's second-biggest airline will be required from a smaller set of short-listed candidates by June 12, with a sale expected by the end of that month, the Deloitte administrators have said.
The company entered voluntary administration last month owing nearly A$7 billion ($4.6 billion), making it the biggest Asia-Pacific casualty of the coronavirus crisis hitting the global aviation industry.
""We know aviation isn't going to return to normal any time soon, but Bain Capital is here for the long haul with deep funding to navigate these difficult times,"" said Bain Capital Sydney-based managing director Mike Murphy.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The more than a century old car rental firm Hertz Global Holdings (NYSE:HTZ) Inc filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday after its business was decimated during the coronavirus pandemic and talks with creditors failed to result in much needed relief.
Hertz's board earlier in the day approved the company seeking Chapter 11 protection in a U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware, according to court records. Its international operating regions including Europe, Australia and New Zealand were not included in the U.S. proceedings, the company said.
The firm, whose largest shareholder is billionaire investor Carl Icahn with a nearly 39% ownership stake, is reeling from government orders restricting travel and requiring citizens to remain home. A large portion of Hertz's revenue comes from car rentals at airports, which have all but evaporated as potential customers eschew plane travel.
With nearly $19 billion of debt and roughly 38,000 employees worldwide as of the end of 2019, Hertz is among the largest companies to be undone by the pandemic. The public health crisis has also caused a cascade of bankruptcies or Chapter 11 preparations among companies dependent on consumer demand, including retailers, restaurants and oil and gas firms.
U.S. airlines have so far avoided similar fates after receiving billions of dollars in government aid, an avenue Hertz has explored without success.
The Estero, Florida-based company, which operates Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty car-rentals, had been in talks with creditors after skipping significant car-lease payments due in April. Forbearance and waiver agreements on the missed payments were set to expire on May 22. Hertz has about $1 billion of cash. 
The size of Hertz's lease obligations have increased as the value of vehicles declined because of the pandemic. In an attempt to appease creditors holding asset-backed securities that finance its fleet of more than 500,000 vehicles, Hertz has proposed selling more than 30,000 cars a month through the end of the year in an effort to raise around $5 billion, a person familiar with the matter said.
On May 16, the board appointed executive Paul Stone to replace Kathryn Marinello as CEO. Hertz earlier laid off about 10,000 employees and said there was substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Hertz's woes are compounded by the complexity of its balance sheet, which includes more than $14 billion of securitized debt. The proceeds from those securities finance purchases of vehicles that are then leased to Hertz in exchange for monthly payments that have risen as the value of cars fall.
Hertz also has traditional credit lines, loans and bonds with conditions that can trigger defaults based on missing those lease payments or failing to meet other conditions, such as delivering a timely operating budget and reimbursing funds it has borrowed. 
Hertz earlier signaled it could avoid bankruptcy if it received relief from creditors or financial aid the company and its competitors have sought from the U.S. government. The U.S. Treasury has started assisting companies as part of an unprecedented $2.3 trillion relief package passed by Congress and signed into law.
A trade group representing Hertz, the American Car Rental Association, has asked Congress to do more for the industry by expanding coronavirus relief efforts and advancing new legislation targeting tourism-related businesses.
Even before the pandemic, Hertz and its peers were under financial pressure as travelers shifted to ride-hailing services such as Uber (NYSE:UBER). 
To combat Uber, Hertz had adopted a turnaround plan, aiming to modernize its smartphone apps and improve management of its fleet of rental cars.

Hertz traces its roots to 1918, when Walter Jacobs, then a pioneer of renting cars, founded a company allowing customers to temporarily drive one of a dozen Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co Model Ts, according to the company's website.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2020 12:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. accuses China of blocking U.S. flights, demands action","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government late on Friday accused the Chinese government of making it impossible for U.S. airlines to resume service to China and ordered four Chinese air carriers to file flight schedules with the U.S. government.
The administration of President Donald Trump stopped short of imposing restrictions on Chinese air carriers but said talks with China had failed to produce an agreement. 
The U.S. Transportation Department, which is trying to persuade China to allow the resumption of U.S. passenger airline service there, earlier this week briefly delayed a few Chinese charter flights for not complying with notice requirements. 
In an order posted on a U.S. government website and seen by Reuters, the department noted Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and United Airlines want to resume flights to China in June, even as Chinese carriers have continued U.S. flights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The order said Air China (OTC:AIRYY), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp, China Southern Airlines Co, Hainan Airlines Holding Co and their subsidiaries must file schedules and other details of flights by May 27. The department warned it could find Chinese flights ""contrary to applicable law or adversely affect the public interest.""
United declined to comment. The other U.S. and Chinese carriers, the Civil Aviation Authority of China (CAAC) and China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The department said in a statement it has ""protested this situation to the Chinese authorities, repeatedly objecting to China’s failure to let U.S. carriers fully exercise their rights and to the denial to U.S. carriers of their right to compete on a fair and equal basis with Chinese carriers"" and called the situation ""critical.""
On Jan. 31, the U.S. government barred from entry most non-U.S. citizens who had been in China within the previous 14 days but did not impose any restrictions on Chinese flights. Major U.S. carriers voluntarily decided to halt all passenger flights to China in February.
Delta and United are flying cargo flights to China. Delta had requested approval for a daily flight to Shanghai Pudong airport from Detroit and Seattle, while United had asked to fly daily to Shanghai Pudong from San Francisco and Newark airport near New York and between San Francisco and Beijing.
The number of weekly scheduled combination flights operated between the two countries by U.S and Chinese carriers fell from 325 in January to 20, by just the four Chinese carriers, in mid-February, before the carriers increased them to 34 in mid-March, the U.S. order said.
The CAAC in late March said Chinese airlines could maintain just one weekly passenger flight on one route to any given country and that carriers could fly no more than the number of flights they were flying on March 12, according to the U.S. order.
But because U.S. passenger airlines had stopped all flights by March 12, the CAAC notice ""effectively precludes U.S. carriers from reinstating scheduled passenger flights to China,"" the department said.
CAAC told the U.S. government during a May 14 call that China is considering removing the March 12 schedule pre-condition but the ""restriction to once-weekly service on one route to China would remain in place,"" the order said.

Earlier on Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department added 33 Chinese companies and institutions to an economic blacklist for alleged human rights violations and to address U.S. national security concerns involving weapons of mass destruction and other military activities.

""Medium-term, we will certainly be able to get by with fewer staff - primarily, as we continue to automate business,"" Gottstein said in the interview, published on Saturday. ""Many processes can still be streamlined. That is one of my priorities. But we also want to grow, especially in our business with very wealthy clients and in our Asian business."" 
Gottstein, the former head of Credit Suisse's Swiss business, who became CEO in February, does not expect Credit Suisse to post a loss this year, even as he expects higher credit losses for the bank's Swiss and international business in the next six to 12 months on global fallout of the coronavirus pandemic than the bank has seen over the past five years. 
""I'm convinced we will absorb (these losses) and are correctly positioned from a strategic standpoint,"" he said, noting the bank's return on tangible equity in the first quarter had exceeded its full-year target.
Gottstein expects employees to spend 10%-20% of their time working from home in the future, he told the newspaper, leading to savings on office space.
The bank will also benefit from a reduction in travel, as video conferencing takes off, he said, and in the future will operate fewer branches, as online banking receives a lasting boost following coronavirus lockdowns.
""As universal banks, we can learn a great deal from (digital providers such as Revolut and N26), especially when it comes to offering customers services via digital channels in the simplest, quickest and most convenient way possible,"" Gottstein said. ""In the coming months, we will respond to these new competitors with various offerings.""
Under Gottstein's predecessor, Tidjane Thiam, Switzerland's second-biggest bank had repositioned itself to focus on wealth management while whittling down its investment bank.

Kuehne+Nagel, which employs 83,000 people, will likely cut jobs in locations such as the United States that unlike some European countries does not have a system of short-time working to fall back on to prevent massive layoffs, he told Germany's Die Welt in an article published on Saturday.
He sees globalisation slowing, with a trend towards regionalisation. 
""The group could have 20-25% fewer workers than before the crisis,"" he said. ""We will emerge from the crisis smaller.""
The 2020 result will definitely be worse than a year ago, said Kuehne, adding nobody knows how long the crisis will last and how deep it will be. The company has already scrapped its dividend.
""The moments of truth come in the April to June period,"" he said. ""Transport volumes have declined significantly. The decisive question is, will the world economy begin a gradual recovery in June.""
""I expect that economic production will be lower for years to come,"" Kuehne told the newspaper.
China is unlikely to emerge weakened from the crisis, he said, even though it is the origin of the coronavirus, likely in a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan. 

""This crisis was started by carelessness within the Chinese food supply. For me it is unbelievable such primitive conditions still exist,"" he said. ""And still, China -- with its readiness to invest in projects like the new Silk Road -- has an unbelievable strength. I wish we had a strong United States as a counterweight, but it is poorly governed by Donald Trump. This could be an opportunity for a strong, courageous Europe.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group representing many major automakers on Friday backed the Trump administration's decision to weaken Obama administration fuel efficiency standards but said it opposed further reductions in requirements.
In March, the Trump administration issued final rules requiring 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026 - far weaker than the 5% increases in the discarded Obama-era rules - but abandoned its August 2018 proposal to freeze requirements at 2020 levels through 2026.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and others -- on Friday intervened in a litigation on behalf of the Trump administration, saying it believed the Environmental Protection Agency and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ""lawfully exercised their discretion in setting their standards in accordance with the applicable statutory requirements.""
The group added the new standards ""properly balance improvement in fuel economy and (greenhouse gas) emissions performance.
The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) in April asked a federal appeals court to order the administration to reconsider its plan, saying it should have further reduced or frozen the requirements. The group argues the agencies ""failed to adequately consider the adverse traffic safety impacts of their chosen fuel economy standards.""
The auto group opposed CEI's legal challenge.
Five automakers -- including Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) -- that announced separate agreements with California on fuel economy standards in 2019 are not participating in the legal intervention.
Representative Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, criticized the automakers' announcement, noting they previously intervened on behalf of the Trump administration in support of a separate regulation to strip California of its right to set emissions rules.
""The American auto industry can either lead or be led,"" she said.

California and 22 other U.S. states also plan to challenge the March rewrite, saying the administration should not have relaxed the Obama rules.

PARIS (Reuters) - A Paris court ruled that insurer AXA (PA:AXAF) must pay a restaurant owner two months' worth of coronavirus-related revenue losses, the restaurateur's lawyer said on Friday, potentially opening the door to a wave of similar litigation.
The ruling will be of interest to restaurants, cafes and nightclubs in Britain and the United States which are also threatening legal action against insurers who have not paid out on business interruption policies.
 Axa  said it would appeal. 
The case was brought by Stephane Manigold, who owns four Paris restaurants. He filed a lawsuit demanding AXA cover his operating losses after a government order in mid-March to close bars and restaurants to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
When he learned of Friday's verdict at his office, Manigold high-fived a colleague and his supporters applauded. ""This is a collective victory,"" he told Reuters. He later cried as he spoke to reporters in front of one of his shuttered restaurants. 
The court said the administrative decision to close the restaurant qualified for insurance cover as a business interruption loss. 
""This means that all companies with the same clause can appeal to their insurers,"" Manigold's lawyer, Anais Sauvagnac, said.
AXA said a small number of its clients in the French hospitality sector were covered for COVID 19-related losses because they bought a special policy. But most clients in the sector did not have that policy and did not quality for compensation, AXA said.
If all COVID 19-related losses were deemed covered by insurance, French insurers would have to compensate 20 billion euros ($21.8 billion) per month, industry estimates show.
Whatever the outcome in AXA's court case, prolonged legal wrangling might prompt the French insurance regulator to insist insurers put aside additional reserves to offset legal risk, said Benjamin Serra of Moody's (NYSE:MCO) ratings agency.

This, Serra said, ""would impact insurers' profitability this year.""

(Reuters) - A group representing some of the largest U.S. employers has asked Congress for a year-long ban on mergers and acquisitions among hospitals and doctors groups that received government money to cope with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Pacific Business Group on Health, whose members include Boeing (NYSE:BA), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), said in a letter addressed to congressional leaders this week that it feared that further consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to higher costs.
Physician practices’ revenues have plummeted across the United States since shutdowns were imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, as patients stay home except for emergencies. 
Even before the pandemic, well-funded hospital systems were taking over smaller doctors groups and hospitals to increase market share.
PBGH said it fears these larger players will be even better positioned to buy struggling practices coming out of the crisis, raising healthcare prices for employers. The group asked for a year-long M&A ban for any healthcare provider receiving any of the $170 billion government relief approved for the industry. 
""Anti-competitive practices are increasingly concerning to large employers. What we’re seeing happening right now is the collapse of independent primary care,"" Elizabeth Mitchell, chief executive officer of PBGH, told Reuters.Politicians and regulators have already been scrutinizing mergers in the hospital industry. 

The Federal Trade Commission moved to block a merger between two Pennsylvania hospitals in February, on the grounds that consolidation would mean the systems would have fewer incentives to keep costs down.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday it would add 33 Chinese firms and institutions to an economic blacklist for helping Beijing spy on its minority Uighur population or because of ties to weapons of mass destruction and China's military.
The U.S. Commerce Department's move marked the Trump administration's latest efforts to crack down on companies whose goods may support Chinese military activities and to punish Beijing for its treatment of Muslim minorities. It came as Communist Party rulers in Beijing on Friday unveiled details of a plan to impose national security laws on Hong Kong.
Seven companies and two institutions were listed for being ""complicit in human rights violations and abuses committed in China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs"" and others, the Commerce Department said in a statement.
Two dozen other companies, government institutions and commercial organizations were added for supporting procurement of items for use by the Chinese military, the department said in another statement.
The blacklisted companies focus on artificial intelligence and facial recognition, markets that U.S. chip companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) have been heavily investing in. 
Among the companies named is NetPosa, one of China's most famous AI companies, whose facial recognition subsidiary is linked to the surveillance of Muslims. 
Qihoo360, a major cybersecurity firm taken private and delisted from the Nasdaq in 2015, recently made headlines for claiming it had found evidence that CIA hacking tools were used to target the Chinese aviation sector. 
The Commerce Department said it was adding the firms and institutions to its ""entity list,"" which restricts sales of U.S. goods shipped to them and some more limited items made abroad with U.S. content or technology. Companies can apply for licenses to make the sales, but they must overcome a presumption of denial.
Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp-backed CloudMinds was also added. It operates a cloud-based service to run robots such as a version of Pepper, a humanoid robot capable of simple communication. The company was blocked last year from transferring technology or technical information from its U.S. unit to its offices in Beijing, Reuters reported in March.
Qihoo, NetPosa and CloudMinds could not be immediately reached for comment.
 Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX), which makes programmable chips, said at least one of its customers was on the list but that it believes the business impact will be negligible.
“Xilinx is aware of the recent additions to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List and is evaluating any potential business impact,"" the company said. ""We comply with any new U.S. Department of Commerce rules and regulations.”
The new listings follow a similar October 2019 action when Commerce added 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies - including some of China's top artificial intelligence startups and video surveillance company Hikvision - to a U.S. trade blacklist over the treatment of Uighur Muslims.

The actions follow the same blueprint used by Washington in its attempt to limit the influence of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for what it says are national security reasons. Last week, Commerce took action to try to further cut off Huawei's access to chipmakers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A range of business groups have made an 11th-hour appeal to U.S. President Donald Trump as he weighs whether to restrict temporary work visas, warning of negative economic consequences if he blocks the flow of skilled foreign workers into the United States.
More than 300 U.S. companies, business associations and higher education groups that employ skilled workers sent a letter to Trump on Thursday that said reducing access to those workers - even for a short period - would result in ""unintended consequences"" and cause ""substantial economic uncertainty.""
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) , Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) were among the companies pushing for Trump to leave H-1B visas, student visas and other skilled visas untouched. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce - the nation's largest business association - also joined the effort.
""The undersigned represent employers that rely on a highly skilled, college-educated, science and engineering workforce, including non-immigrant professionals, to innovate, produce, research, develop, and lead,"" the companies wrote, calling their hiring needs ""in the national interest.""
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump issued an executive order last month that blocked certain immigrants abroad from obtaining permanent residence, a move he said would protect American workers during the economic crisis. The order also called for several U.S. agencies to review temporary visas programs and submit recommendations within 30 days. The deadline for that was Friday, although Trump does not need to act immediately.
Some immigration hard-liners have called for Trump to pause the visas altogether. 

A Teamsters union official on Friday criticized a recent Trump administration move to ease requirements for U.S. food supply chain businesses employing seasonal workers through the H-2B visa program, saying the workers are ""especially vulnerable to retaliation if they seek a safer workplace.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said late on Friday it had granted tentative approval to 15 airlines to temporarily halt service to 75 U.S. airports because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Airlines must maintain minimum service levels in order to receive government assistance but many have petitioned to stop service to airports with low passenger demand.
Both United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) won tentative approval to halt flights to 11 airports, while JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU), Alaska Airlines (N:ALK) and Frontier Airlines were approved to stop flights to five airports each. The department said all airports would continue to be served by at least one air carrier.
The Transportation Department said objections to the order can be filed until May 28.
U.S. air carriers are collectively burning through more than $10 billion in cash a month as travel demand remains a fraction of prior levels, even though it has rebounded slightly in recent weeks. They have parked more than half of their planes and cut thousands of flights. 
The department has previously granted airlines waivers to cancel some additional flights and denied others. On May 12, the department said it would allow carriers to halt flights to up to 5% of required destinations.
Under the tentative order, Delta can halt service to Aspen, Colorado; Bangor, Maine; Flint, Michigan; Santa Barbara, California; and Lincoln, Nebraska, among other cities, while United can halt service to airports including Chattanooga, Tennessee; Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Key West, Florida; and Lansing and Kalamazoo, Michigan.
JetBlue can halt flights to Albuquerque, New Mexico; 
Palm Springs and Sacramento, California; Sarasota, Florida; and Worcester, Massachusetts.
Alaska can suspend flights to Charleston, South Carolina; 
Columbus, Ohio; El Paso and San Antonio, Texas; and New Orleans.

Only half of eligible carriers have applied to cut more flights.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Private renewable energy firms in Mexico should pay for part of the baseload power underpinning the flow of electricity on the grid, the head of the state power company said on Friday, as a dispute on the future of the local industry roils the market.
Manuel Bartlett, director of the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) and staunch defender of the state, told Reuters he favors more clean energy and wants to reduce Mexico's use of fuel oil as a major source of power generation.
But he said renewable operators had not been pulling their weight in contributing to the infrastructure that sustains them.
""Wind and photovoltaic (plants) don't pay the CFE for the backup,"" said Bartlett, referring to the cost of power generation from fossil fuels, mostly natural gas, to guarantee uninterrupted flow. 
""Do you think it's fair for the CFE to subsidize these companies that don't produce power all day?"" he asked.
The firms should also start helping to pay transmission costs, he said.
""That's not a free market, it's theft,"" said Bartlett, a close ally of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has pledged to hold down electricity rates.
Renewable companies argue they can produce more efficiently than the CFE and help Mexico reduce its emissions.
Last month, Mexico's power grid regulator CENACE issued a ruling supported by Bartlett that prevented several dozen new renewable energy plants from connecting to the network.
CENACE cited the coronavirus pandemic as a justification, arguing that intermittent wind and solar power is not consistent with ensuring constant electricity supply.
Business associations said the move put more than $6 billion in renewable power plants scheduled to begin operating this year or next in limbo.
In a provisional ruling this week, a judge ordered CENACE to back down and allow the renewable firms to continue for now with tests needed to bring plants online.
Bartlett, an 84-year-old former interior minister who has been a force in Mexican politics for decades, said he is not seeking to restore CFE's decades-long monopoly that was ended by the previous government. 
But he said Lopez Obrador has instructed him to ensure the CFE generates at least 54% of power output, its current level.
""I accept that there's going to be private investment.""
Last Friday, the energy ministry moved aggressively to give the government more control over power supplies by seeking fast-tracked regulatory approval for a ruling designed to give the state more say over who can generate electricity and how much, again citing the pandemic as a rationale.
The move promoted the head of a government regulatory commission to abruptly resign.
Bartlett described the notion that the government is resisting more renewable energy as a ""lie.""
""We are not troglodytes, we're serious people,"" he said, adding that he favors cleaner-burning natural gas.
Nevertheless, the government last year canceled a planned auction to purchase renewable energy via long-term contracts, another policy promoted by the last government. 

It also sought to disincentivize a clean-energy certificate scheme, arguing it put the CFE at a disadvantage.

EagleClaw in 2018 acquired natural gas pipeline operator Caprock Midstream Holdings from Energy Spectrum Capital and Caprock Midstream Management for $950 million. After the deal closed, EagleClaw discovered ""numerous issues and claims for liabilities"" with the pipeline assets, according to a lawsuit filed in a Texas court in Houston. 
The largest amount was a $22 million bill presented after the close by  Cimarex Energy  Co (N:XEC) from an audit of a gas gathering, water handling and electrical services agreements, the suit claimed. EagleClaw is owned by private equity firms Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Capital Partners and I Squared Capital.

LONDON/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Billionaire Beny Steinmetz's BSG Resources Ltd (BSGR) is seeking to reopen an arbitration case that ordered it to pay $1.25 billion to Brazilian minder Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) over an abandoned mining joint venture in Guinea.
BSGR has filed documents, seen by Reuters, with a U.S. court which it said shows that Vale was aware of potential bribery or ""red flags"" when the companies partnered to develop Simandou, one of the world's biggest iron ore deposits containing billions of tonnes of the steelmaking ingredient.
The companies are locked in a long-running legal dispute over the joint venture, which was created in 2010 but has since been abandoned. Simandou remains undeveloped.
“The Vale Board should assume full responsibility for their misconduct, publicly clear BSGR of all wrong doing and compensate fully for the commercial value of the loss to BSGR, which could run into billions of dollars,"" Steinmetz said in an emailed statement.
Vale has accused BSGR of fraudulently inducing it to buy a 51 percent stake in the joint venture to develop the mine, a concession later by the Guinean government in 2014 after it said it had evidence BSGR obtained the rights through corruption.
Vale on Friday denied BSGR's accusation, saying it was confident that any court or tribunal would find it in the right.
""Vale is confident that the effort will continue to be rejected by any court or tribunal considering the full record of Vale’s extensive diligence efforts and the extraordinary means that Steinmetz undertook to conceal his fraud from Vale,"" the Brazilian company said in a statement. 
Guinea's President Alpha Conde at the time said Vale was not involved in, or aware of, the corruption.
BSGR, which went into administration in 2018, has denied any wrongdoing in obtaining the Simandou rights. It walked away from the project last year as part of a settlement with Guinea's government in which both parties agreed to drop outstanding legal action. 
Vale filed a U.S. lawsuit in April 2019 to force BSGR to pay it about $1.25 billion, as mandated by a London arbitrator in the dispute, plus interest and expenses, amounting to a total of more than $2 billion.

The lawsuit is still active.

In April, S&P downgraded South Africa's credit rating further into non-investment-grade territory, saying COVID-19-related pressures would have significant adverse implications for the country's already-ailing economy and for tax revenues.
It lowered its long-term foreign-currency rating on South Africa to ""BB-minus"" from ""BB"" and its long-term local-currency rating to ""BB"" from ""BB-plus,"" with a stable outlook.
""COVID-19 will weigh heavily on GDP growth given the strict domestic lockdown that has shut down much of the economy, the markedly weaker external demand outlook, and tighter credit conditions,"" S&P said. ""As a result, we now project the economy to shrink by 4.5% this year.""
The ratings agency projects growth of 3.5% for 2021.
South Africa's lockdown has entered its ninth week, leaving many businesses and individuals struggling without income in the recession-hit economy.
S&P said the weaker macroeconomic environment would also weigh heavily on fiscal revenues, projecting that the fiscal deficit would widen to 13.3% of gross domestic product in 2020 --the widest in the country's democratic history.
S&P estimates net debt levels would rise to over 75% of GDP by the end of 2020.

""As a result, the net debt-to-GDP ratio is unlikely to stabilize within this timeframe, rising to 85% by 2023, raising questions around debt sustainability.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Sculptor Capital Management's (N:SCU) credit funds drew inflows from investors even as losses piled up at its SCU Credit Opportunities fund after weeks of coronavirus-fueled market swings. 
Credit funds operated by Sculptor, formerly known as Och-Ziff Capital Management, received around $1 billion in new money in recent weeks, a person familiar with the fund said. 
Those inflows come despite a rocky March in which the fund badly underperformed its peers. The SCU Credit Opportunities Fund, part of Sculptor's $6 billion lineup of credit portfolios, was down 19.2% in the year to date through April after a 21.5% drop in March, according to investors in the fund.
By contrast, the credit-sensitive HFRI Event Driven Index was down 9.32% in the same time frame.
A representative for Sculptor, which manages a total of $35 billion in assets for pension funds and other wealthy clients and is one of the industry's few publicly-listed firms, declined to comment.
Investors have piled into some credit funds amid the market's recent gyrations, after the Federal Reserve pledged to buy investment-grade bonds as well as select high-yield bonds.
Sculptor's credit fund, led by Chief Investment Officer James Levin, gained 1.4% in 2019 and was up 6.5% in 2018. Since its launch in late 2011 it has returned an average 7.4% a year, beating the BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index return of 4.9% during the same time.
Levin, who as CIO also oversees Sculptor's flagship $10 billion multi-strategy fund, was promoted to head global credit strategies after engineering a bet on structured credit debt which earned Och-Ziff a $2 billion profit in 2012.
Levin became sole CIO in 2018 after Dan Och, the firm's founder, changed his succession plans that had originally envisioned Levin replacing him as CEO. Och has left the company and Levin is expected to be elected to the board in a few weeks.
Some investors in Sculptor's credit fund continue to expect steady performance, despite this year's so-far lackluster results.
""If (Sculptor) can avoid defaults in the portfolio, and a permanent impairment of capital, future returns should be very strong,"" said Michael Rosen, chief investment officer at Angeles Investment Advisors. 
Sculptor's stock price has dropped nearly 50% since January to stand at around $11.79, near record lows. Investors added $555 million in new money to all portfolios during the first quarter after inflows of $2.1 billion in the previous quarter.
In April, the SCU Credit Opportunities fund gained 1.2% percent after March's big drop, investors said.
But other funds have gained more. Oaktree Capital's Oaktree Value Opportunities fund rose 8% last month, leaving it down 6.5% for the year through April, and Mudrick Capital's Distressed Opportunities Fund gained 6.3% in April, leaving it down 4.9% for the year to date through April. PIMCO's Global Credit Opportunities Fund is up 1% through April and Diameter Capital's fund is up 7.5%.
Representatives for those funds declined to comment.

""As our restructuring plans progress, the management board and the group management committee have decided to lead by example and give a broader group of senior managers the opportunity to be part of this initiative"", Jörg Eigendorf, a spokesman for the bank, said in an emailed statement.
The statement added that it was a voluntary measure. It did not specify how many more were going to undertake the pay cuts.
Last week, it was revealed that the bank's top managers will waive one month of fixed pay after the publication of a speech text by Chief Executive Christian Sewing.
The Financial Times newspaper reported that in a Thursday conference call hundreds of the German lender's designated 'leaders', including many of those one level below the senior management committee, were urged to take the voluntary pay cut.
The nine members of the bank's management board and those on the group management committee have agreed to forgo one month of their fixed pay, according to the newspaper.

The bank, which is undergoing an overhaul after five years of losses, is considering other potential cost savings drawn from its experience from the COVID-19 crisis. The overhaul announced last year, includes shedding 18,000 jobs.

The lockdowns of state economies to combat the spread of the coronavirus will translate into an unprecedented 40% annualized decline in second-quarter gross domestic product and a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, JPMorgan economists led by Michael Feroli wrote in a research note Friday.
But growth through 2021 will be weaker than previously projected, the researchers said, citing a separate JPMorgan report that listed reasons including damaged balance sheets, state and local spending cuts, higher saving rates and the prospect that more temporary layoffs become permanent.
As the economy slowly regains its footing the second half of the year, Americans who found themselves out of the labor force as businesses shut down over the last two months will once again start looking for work. That means they would be added to the count of the nation’s unemployed until they find a job.
“As the lockdown eases some of these non-participants are likely to emerge from home and become formal jobseekers. This development should slow the decline in the unemployment rate,” the JPMorgan economists said.
Meantime, a real-time population survey of 1,992 respondents conducted by economics professors Alexander Bick and Adam Blandin in conjunction with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas showed unemployment jumping to 24.8% in the week of May 10-16, the reference week for the government’s April jobs report due out June 5.

(Reuters) - Wall Street ended mixed on Friday in a mostly tame finish to a week of strong gains, as investors gauged China-U.S. tensions and amid ongoing uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery from the coronavirus.
President Donald Trump's warning on Thursday that the U.S. would react strongly to China's plan for a national security law in Hong Kong has raised concerns over Washington and Beijing's possibly reneging on their Phase 1 trade deal.
Late in the session, stocks edged lower after the U.S. Commerce Department said it was adding 33 Chinese companies and other institutions to an economic blacklist for human rights violations and to address U.S. national security concerns.
The increasing rhetoric between Washington and Beijing has knocked Wall Street off multi-month highs, although the three main indexes still all rose around 3% for the week, fueled by optimism about an eventual coronavirus vaccine and the easing of virus-related curbs. 
""We still think COVID-19 concerns are in the driver's seat, but we could see U.S.-China relations move back into the front seat,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. 
U.S. stock exchanges will be closed on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.
The Nasdaq index is down about 5% from its Feb. 19 record high, helped in recent weeks by gains in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other heavyweight companies seen coming out of the economic downturn stronger than their smaller rivals.
The S&P 500 real estate sector index jumped 2.2%, leading the 11 sectors, while energy dropped 0.7% as oil prices sank about 3%. [O/R]
A 1.9% drop in  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) weighed on the Dow. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.04% to end at 24,465.16 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.24%, to 2,955.45. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.43% to 9,324.59.
For the week, the Dow added 3.3%, the S&P 500 rose 3.2%, and the Nasdaq climbed 3.4%.
Mixed earnings from retailers Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) and  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD) earlier this week showed online shopping gaining traction with the lockdown orders, a trend that could damage brick-and-mortar players already feeling pressure from internet rivals.
On Friday, Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group reported better-than-expected quarterly profit, but its shares tumbled almost 6%. Smaller rival  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc's U.S.-listed shares surged over 14% after the company posted upbeat results.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) climbed 2.9% after forecasting strong quarterly revenue as demand surges for its data center chips.
KKR & Co rose 1.1% after India's Reliance Industries said the private equity firm would buy a 2.3% stake in its digital unit for 113.67 billion rupees ($1.50 billion).
Data analytics software maker Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) Inc jumped over 12% after it said it expects more demand for its cloud services.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 8.75 billion shares, compared to the 11.2 billion average for the last 20 trading days.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.30-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Speculators' net bearish bets on the U.S. dollar shrank in the latest week, according to calculations by Reuters and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday.
The net short dollar position was $7.66 billion for the week ended May 19, compared with a net short position of $9.08 billion for the week before that.
The net short was the smallest since speculators turned bearish on the greenback in early March.
U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the Japanese yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
Traders who are long on a currency believe it will rise in value, while being short points to a bearish bias.
In a wider measure of dollar positioning  that includes net contracts on the New Zealand dollar, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Russian ruble, the U.S. dollar posted a net short of $6.58 billion, down from $8.06 billion a week earlier.
The U.S. dollar came under pressure this week as the euro enjoyed a boost from France and Germany's recent proposal for a 500-billion-euro ($543 billion) recovery fund to offer grants to regions and sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
The U.S. Dollar Currency Index (=USD), which measures the greenback's strength against six other major currencies, was on pace to finish the week down 0.6%.

Strong safe-haven demand limited greenback losses as Beijing imposed a new security law on Hong Kong which further strained fast-deteriorating U.S.-China ties.

The Nigerian government filed the case in 2018 at a commercial court in London alleging payments made by the companies to get the oilfield licence in 2011 were used for kickbacks and bribes.
Justice Butcher said in his ruling seen by Reuters that the High Court ""must decline jurisdiction over the action against"" Shell and the other defendants.
Eni said it was pleased the London court had rejected its jurisdiction in the matter, noting the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. SEC had both closed investigations of Eni on OPL 245 matters without taking any action. 
A Shell spokeswoman said the company welcomed the decision.
""We maintain that the 2011 settlement... related to OPL 245 was a fully legal transaction with Eni and the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN),"" she said.
A spokesman for Nigeria said it was ""naturally disappointed the Court has declined jurisdiction"".
""Nigeria continues to support the criminal proceedings underway in Milan ... we intend to seek permission to appeal this decision (in London),"" the spokesman said.
The OPL 245 oilfield is also central to a corruption trial in Milan -- in which former officials from the companies and, in Eni's case, some current ones, are on the bench -- as well as court proceedings Nigeria started against JP Morgan, which processed some of the payments in question.
The bank has said it considers the allegations against it ""unsubstantiated and without merit"".

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed flat, after cutting its intraday losses to post its best weekly win in since April 9. The S&P 500 added 0.24%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.43%
U.S. and China trade tensions flared as the Trump administration raised concerns about China's plan to impose a new security law in Hong Kong that threatens the autonomy of the city.
""The United States strongly urges Beijing to reconsider its disastrous proposal, abide by its international obligations, and respect Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy, democratic institutions, and civil liberties,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday.
Pompeo's statement echoed that of President Donald Trump, who a day earlier said the U.S. ""will address (China's proposed security plans) very strongly.""
The rebuke of Beijing's plans for Hong Kong comes as Trump's ongoing criticism over China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has many concerned that the two economic superpowers could resume their trade war.
Energy stocks led the broader decline as oil prices fell on fresh worries about crude demand after Chinese officials ditched the country's economic growth target of 6% to 6.5% in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) and  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR) were among some of the biggest decliners in energy.
On the earnings front, Deere (NYSE:DE) fell 1.5% after its fiscal second-quarter results were better than feared and helped counter bearish guidance. The company warned that annual performance would be hurt by the pandemic.
 Foot Locker  (NYSE:FL) reported a wider-than-expected loss for the first quarter of 25 cents, with comparable sales slumping 42.8%, sending its shares down 8.7%.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) was up 2.8% after reporting results and guidance that topped estimates, led by solid growth in its data center business. 
Elsewhere,  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) fell 5.38% after Stephens downgraded the stock to equal-weight from overweight on fears the shares have little fundamental backing to move markedly higher from current levels.

MILAN (Reuters) - Benetton-backed  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) has hit out at comments by a member of government calling for its motorway unit to be barred from a state-backed loan needed to prop up business, a move that could stoke an ongoing row over its motorway concession.
The company said it would ask its lawyers ""to evaluate all the actions necessary... in view of the serious damage being caused"" the group and to its Autostrade per l'Italia unit.
Autostrade is in talks for a state-guaranteed loan worth up to 1.25 billion euros to weather the fall in motorway traffic triggered by the coronavirus crisis.
A representative of the ruling coalition 5-Star Movement, which has been pushing for Autostrade's highway concession to be revoked ever since a bridge it operated collapsed and killed 43 people, said the loan guarantee should not be given.
""You have the right to ask, and to answer is a courtesy. NO, thanks,"" Deputy Industry Minister Stefano Buffagni wrote in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday.
While waiting for the state-backed loan, Autostrade could use a 900 million euro ($980 million) credit line granted by its parent company to cope with ""serious financial tensions"", Atlantia said on Friday.
Rome approved a decree in April offering state guarantees on up to 400 billion euros in new bank loans. 
The emergency legislation allows the Treasury to introduce additional requirements, and 5-Star wants Rome to use this option to impose draconian conditions on the company, one party source told Reuters. 
It remains to be seen whether the centre-left PD party, which governs with 5-Star, will back its coalition ally in trying to block the loan.
Autostrade's executives will meet with the Treasury next week to discuss the state-backed loan, a third source said.
In addition to Autostrade, three other companies controlled by the Benettons are interested in state-backed loans, bringing the total potential requests to more than 1.8 billion euros.
Disagreement over the group's request for state-backed funds has reignited tensions with Rome over the potential revocation of it motorway concession. 
Atlantia also complained the government had not yet replied to a 2.9 billion euro proposal filed by Autostrade at the start of March to end the row over the concession.

""This situation has caused, and continues to cause, serious damage to the group as a whole and has given rise to concern among investors,"" it said.

(Reuters) - Organizers said Friday they were canceling the 2020 New York auto show that had previously been pushed back until August, citing the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the venue's use as a field hospital.
The show, which was initially set for early April and is typically used to unveil new vehicles, was set to take place at the Javits Convention Center. However, the center is now being used as an active hospital and is in standby mode for the foreseeable future, organizers said.
The next New York show will take place April 2-11, 2021. A string of auto shows have been canceled this year and some automakers -- like  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp -- are opting to hold virtual unveilings of new vehicles.
Mark Schienberg, president of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, the organization that owns and operates the 120-year-old New York Auto Show, noted that automakers and their exhibit partners needed ""immense planning"" to construct a show. ""Because of the uncertainty caused by the virus, we feel it would not be prudent to continue with the 2020 Show,"" he said.
Large gatherings in New York have been canceled through at least Labor Day, including Broadway shows.
Detroit's auto show that had been set for June was canceled in March. The Paris Motor show scheduled for late September/early October in March was canceled as were auto shows in Geneva.
A major event for luxury car unveilings, the Concours d’Elegance in Pebble Beach, California, was also canceled. Beijing's 2020 auto show was postponed until September.

Auto shows are often visited by potential new car buyers but cost tens of millions of dollars to put on. Many automakers have rethought whether they still make economic sense amid the pandemic and have scaled back the number of shows they take part in.

Typically, U.S. equity volumes are about 13% below their average ahead of Memorial Day weekend. This week, total composite volumes have been just 5% shy of the 2020 average. Friday’s trading volume has been a bit more typical of a pre-holiday slowdown, down about 11% compared to the yearly average.
Traders say work has seemed slower than usual over the last five days, with most attributing it to the end of earnings season and upcoming holiday. Exhaustion has also played a role. Equity volumes have exploded this year as the Covid-19 pandemic roiled markets, with average daily volume jumping almost 60% so far this year compared to the average of 2019.
As traders work from home, the jump in volume could indicate a larger shift to more electronic trading for big institutions. Individuals and retail traders who wouldn’t normally trade through a bank’s trading desk have done their part as well, using their free time to invest and take advantage of zero commissions.
“There is a bit of exhaustion,” Philip Lawlor, FTSE Russell’s managing director of Global Markets Research, said earlier this week. “Volume could dry up as people gradually close out their positions and protect themselves from an exogenous bit of news that we have learned can pop up over these weekends.”

1420,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russian ventilators reached U.S. states without FDA oversight,"By Marisa Taylor and Gleb Stolyarov
WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian-made ventilators now under investigation for causing deaths in Russia were not authorized by U.S. health regulators before the same model was sent to New York and New Jersey at the height of their coronavirus outbreaks, Reuters has learned.
The 45 Aventa-M ventilators were sent to the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the shipment in a March 30 phone call. The equipment was received by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officers in New York on April 1st.
At the time, officials in New York and New Jersey were bracing for an expected wave of severely ill patients in desperate need of mechanical breathing assistance as the coronavirus attacked their lungs.
The Kremlin and U.S. State Department hailed the delivery as an example of collaboration to fight a common enemy.
To help cope with the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had introduced an emergency protocol to allow ventilators to be distributed without the agency's routine, and more time-consuming, approval process.
The Russian ventilators, however, did not even receive the FDA's expedited Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) before being delivered to New York and New Jersey, the agency told Reuters.
Earlier this month, Russia suspended use of some Aventa-M ventilators after six people died in hospital fires that reportedly involved the devices.
U.S. officials have said the ventilators were never supplied to local hospitals, which ultimately did not need as many as feared, and are being returned to FEMA. A New Jersey health official told Reuters the Aventa-M ventilators required an electrical voltage not compatible in the United States. 
But the lack of FDA oversight on the Russian shipment adds to concerns about shortcuts taken by the Trump administration in responding to the pandemic. The FDA has issued EUAs for ventilators from other sources. 
""In this case, the FDA was rendered irrelevant,"" said Michael Carome, director of health research for the non-profit watchdog Public Citizen. ""Here we have the wild, wild West with Trump going out and negotiating deals in other countries without coordinating with public health experts.""
The White House declined to comment, and referred to a FEMA statement earlier this month that said the ventilators had not been used.
""The conclusion(s) of the investigation being conducted by the Russian authorities ... will help inform our decision regarding any future use of the ventilators,"" FEMA said.
In an email to Reuters, FEMA said the agency and FDA ""did not have all the details on the products before the shipment arrived on April 1."" However, FEMA said FDA officers inspected the goods upon arrival and allowed them into the country.    
A source close to the Russian government who is familiar with the situation said FDA permission may not have been required because ""this cargo was a symbolic thing.""
""It had more political than practical meaning,"" the source added.
        
NEW RULES
The FDA told Reuters the Aventa-M ventilators were distributed under a policy that its website shows was created on March 22. The new rules allowed ventilators to be used in the United States without an EUA while the FDA works ""interactively with the firms to get the required authorizations,"" an FDA spokeswoman said in a statement.
Under that policy, the FDA would notify the manufacturer that it does not intend to object to the distribution ""while the manufacturer is preparing, and FDA is reviewing, the EUA request.""
The FDA would also ask the manufacturer to provide information ahead of distribution, including documentation showing the device's power supply is compatible with U.S. standards, which the Aventa-M ventilators were not.
The agency declined to say whether it obtained such documentation for the Aventa-M.   
""The FDA continues to gather information to help us evaluate the safety of these products,"" an FDA spokeswoman told Reuters.
Russian manufacturer Ural Instrument Engineering Plant (UPZ) was under U.S. sanctions at the time of the shipment. Concern Radio-Electronic Technologies, UPZ's parent company, declined to comment other than to say it did not deliver the Aventa-M ventilators directly to the United States.
The 15 ventilators sent to New Jersey ""were delivered by FEMA and recalled by FEMA,” said state Department of Health spokeswoman Janelle Fleming.
New York returned the 30 Russian ventilators on May 12th, said health department spokesman Jonah Bruno.
The Trump administration has since pledged humanitarian aid to Russia, where coronavirus infections and deaths are rising. This week, a U.S. Air Force plane delivered medical aid, including 50 U.S.-made ventilators, to Russia.

""In both cases, we are talking about sincere, humanitarian gestures and interaction in emergency situations,"" Maria Zakharova, a Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman, said on Thursday.

1423,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 22, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Stock Delisting Offers U.S. a Tempting Target in China Tensions,"(Bloomberg) -- Political momentum intensified this week to curtail investments in Chinese companies, in the latest sign that tensions between the world’s two largest economies have reignited.
While a push for tougher scrutiny of financial ties between the U.S. and China has long simmered in Washington, the Senate quickly -- and in bipartisan fashion -- moved Wednesday to advance legislation that could result in delisting some securities from American stock exchanges.
The added urgency stems in part from mounting calls for lawmakers and President Donald Trump to punish China for its alleged failure to disclose information early on about the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The pandemic has cost more than 90,000 American lives and resulted in tens of millions in job losses.
The economic hit has curbed Trump’s ability to pressure China through tariffs, which can increase costs for American businesses and consumers. That has turned attention to other points of contention, like investment transparency. Earlier this month, the Trump administration and lawmakers stopped the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which oversees a retirement savings plan for government workers, from moving to a benchmark index for its international fund that includes Chinese stocks.
Investor Protection
U.S. stocks dropped for a second straight day as relations between the U.S. and China -- which had improved with an initial trade deal earlier this year -- appeared to deteriorate with news of the legislation and as strains flared again over Hong Kong. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index is little changed from the level it reached at the end of April.
Proponents of stricter rules on Chinese stocks argue that it’s in the interest of national security and investors.
“The level of fraud, the lack of transparency, the failure for investor protections, that has to be changed,” White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Thursday during an event hosted by the Washington Post.
The Senate legislation would require companies including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). to certify they’re not controlled by a foreign government. The firms would have to do so because Chinese firms block Washington-based regulators from inspecting financial audits.
The bill says that if the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board can’t review the companies’ audits for three straight years, their securities would be banned from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq or elsewhere in America.
A companion bill has been introduced in the House and Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that the appropriate committees will review it, but she stopped short of promising a vote.
Goldman Analysis
Wall Street immediately took note of the heightened attention from Congress. Analysts at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). sent a report to clients Thursday that suggested a forced de-listing could lead to abrupt price actions. Chinese companies traded in the U.S. have a market cap in excess of a trillion dollars and about $8 billion of those stocks change hands every day on average, according to the analysis.
Their research examined the Congressional proposal and its potential impact, saying that the focus of U.S. regulators and legislators on this issue has recently been elevated after some recent cases of alleged accounting irregularities.
For some, the need for action was exemplified by China-based  Luckin Coffee  (NASDAQ:LK) Inc., a coffee chain embroiled in an accounting scandal. The company recently announced the Nasdaq stock exchange’s intention to de-list the company in a statement.
“Had this legislation already been signed into law, U.S. investors in Luckin Coffee likely would have avoided billions of dollars in losses,” Democratic Representative Brad Sherman of California, who introduced the House bill, said in a statement.
Three Years
Still, the reality is nothing will change overnight, or likely anytime soon.
Even if the Senate bill were to become law, any eventual de-listing of Chinese firms would be years away -- potentially long after Trump and many current lawmakers have already left office.
Roger Robinson, president and CEO of RWR Advisory, a research and risk management consultancy, said the bill is a “remarkable bipartisan repudiation of the preferential treatment accorded to Chinese companies in our capital markets.”
“Three years, however, is far too long before decisive action is taken against non-compliant companies,” said Robinson, who’s long pushed for stricter enforcement of U.S. auditing rules.
SEC Rules
The bill would also require the SEC to write a regulation, invoking the agency’s lengthy rule-making process. Finalizing an SEC rule requires at least two rounds of votes by a bipartisan commission, as well as a series procedural steps like public notice and comment. Trump’s sway over the process is also limited because of the SEC’s status as an independent agency.
So far, SEC Chairman Jay Clayton has issued a series of public statements warning American investors about the accounting issues related to Chinese firms whose auditors refuse to open their books. The agency has also announced a roundtable discussion on July 9 that will involve commentary from investors, industry and regulators on risks associated with investing in China and other emerging markets.
Derek Scissors, China scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he doesn’t believe any Chinese firm will either disclose properly or be de-listed as a result of the bill.
“We’ll start another round of negotiations in 2021, no matter who’s president, and announce another agreement in which they falsely promise to disclose and we agree to keep them listed,” he said.
Stock Exchanges
Exchanges including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq have previously pushed back against the idea of delisting. But they’ve come under increasing government pressure amid the growing fervor for action against Chinese companies. Spokesmen for the NYSE and Nasdaq declined to comment.
“We do have some very specific issues with the way that disclosures are provided from certain emerging markets, including China,” Nasdaq Inc. Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said this month in a Bloomberg Television interview.
While the issue has only recently become a political focus for China hawks in the White House, for regulators the problem dates back almost two decades. The inspections by the little-known PCAOB, which Congress established in 2002 in response to the massive Enron Corp. accounting scandal, are meant to prevent fraud and wrongdoing that could wipe out shareholders.

1424,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",Hedge funds increased exposure to growth favorites in first quarter: Goldman,"(Reuters) - Hedge funds concentrated their portfolios even further into growth stocks including Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) in the first quarter of 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic pummeled U.S. markets, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts said in a report.
The two American multinationals saw the largest increase in hedge fund holdings, according to an analysis by the bank of 822 funds with 1.8 trillion in gross equity positions.
Along with  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) and China's  Alibaba  (N:BABA), they have been hedge funds' top five long positions for seven consecutive quarters, the report said.
Goldman Sachs said the focus on growth stocks, which tend to outperform the overall market, had supported recent hedge fund performance as Wall Street witnessed one of the quickest turns to a bear market amid a near-collapse in business activity.
From peak to trough, the S&P 500 slumped more than 35% in just 23 trading sessions, with investors ditching the so-called value stocks in favor of growth stocks.
Overall, funds also rotated further toward defensive sectors such as real estate, consumer staples and utilities as opposed to cyclicals.
Among sectors, Goldman Sachs said healthcare enjoyed the most net exposure, with funds also shifting to beneficiaries of the past two months' stay-at-home orders including online retail and internet services.

1425,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",Alibaba's sales surge as people shop online during lockdown,"(Reuters) -  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd on Friday reported forecast-beating fourth-quarter revenues and profits, as more people shopped online for essentials because of the coronavirus lockdowns.
As people stayed indoors and brick-and-mortar stores remained shut during the health crisis, online orders surged, with the company's core commerce business rising nearly 19% to 93.87 billion yuan ($13.16 billion) in the quarter. 
Revenue at its cloud computing business rose about 58%. 
Alibaba CFO Maggie Wu said the results contrasted with the company's guidance from the previous quarter, when it had predicted a drop in revenue.
""I’m pleased to report we reported better than expected March quarter results,"" she said.
With China's economy starting up again much ahead of major economies in Europe and the United States, the e-commerce group said it expected to generate more than 650 billion yuan in revenue in fiscal 2021.
Alibaba has been expanding into new businesses and technologies to cope with increased competition in online shopping from smaller rivals such as JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc, which is popular with residents in China's lower-tier cities.
Alibaba's overall revenue rose to 114.31 billion yuan ($16.02 billion) in the quarter ended March 31 from about 93.50 billion yuan a year earlier. 
Analysts had expected revenue of 107.04 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company said that gross merchandise volume exceeded $1 trillion for the first time in its fiscal year ending in March.
Excluding items, the company earned 9.20 yuan per American Depository Share. Analysts were expecting 6.10 yuan per ADS, according to Refinitiv data.
U.S.-listed shares of the company were marginally up in trading before the bell. 
CFO Wu said the company was closely monitoring a bill passed this week by the U.S. Senate that would require listed companies to reveal they are not owned by a foreign government. The bill is written to apply to all foreign companies but is targeted at China.
""Alibaba’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP..."" said Wu, referring to U.S. accounting rules. ""We have been an SEC filer since 2014 and hold ourselves to the highest standard of transparency.""

1426,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 10:42AM ET</span>",U.S. shale bust slams rural economies as oil checks shrivel,"By Jennifer Hiller
DeWITT COUNTY, Texas (Reuters) - Royalties from oil pumped on Paul Ruckman's land allowed the South Texas retiree to build a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom vacation home. He had plenty left over, and donated some of it to Helena, Texas, an 1800s ghost town that draws hundreds to historic buildings and gunfight re-enactments.
The worst oil bust in decades has slashed the bounty that flowed to millions of rural Americans like Ruckman, who said his royalty checks have plummeted 70% since January.
""I imagine they're going to be dropping quite a bit more,"" said Ruckman, who owns the land with his brothers.
The bust has erased tens of thousands of jobs in the drilling and service sectors, dried up local tax revenues and charitable largess that flowed along with crude oil to Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma. 
Thanks to modern drilling technology, shale has turned the United States into the world's No. 1 energy producer, pumping as much as 13 million barrels per day (bpd) before prices crashed. It added about a percentage point to U.S. GDP between 2010 and 2015. Shale-related jobs lifted the employment rate in Texas and North Dakota to a multiple of the national average. 
In DeWitt County, Texas, 80 miles (129 km) southeast of San Antonio, incomes shot up to sixth highest among the state's 254 counties at the peak of the shale boom in 2014 from 116th a decade ago, based on U.S. tax data.
Shale oil fed a global glut. OPEC and allied producers supported prices by cutting output, but this year Saudi Arabia and Russia briefly pumped more. Then fuel demand collapsed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Oil prices are about half January's level, and many shale producers have shut wells. 
U.S. output could fall about 2 million bpd this year and next, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has estimated. 
(For a graphic on how shale lifted U.S. incomes, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3g75QvW)
MAILBOX MONEY 
Ruckman is among 12 million U.S. mineral owners who collect ""mailbox money,"" or payments for oil and gas extracted from their land. He declined to say how much his property drew, but residents in the heart of Texas' Eagle Ford shale got bigger royalties than many, able to negotiate richer leases because the region came later to the boom. 
Royalties, which can range from 12.5% to 25% of the value of oil and gas pumped, helped revitalize DeWitt and other communities in oil patches across the United States.
John Baen, a Texas college professor who owns mineral rights in South Texas, collected as much as $100,000 a month in recent years. The payments have dwindled to $6,000 and by August, he said, ""I'll be lucky to get anything."" 
The average oil-land owner collects about $500 a month, according to the National Association of Royalty Owners, but that will not last. April's price crash was so sharp, falling at one point into negative territory, that minerals holder Jubilee Royalty Holdings received a $1 check that month from  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM).
The shale boom paid off debt from restoring DeWitt's pink granite and sandstone courthouse and expanding the jail. Oil helped finance the area's Boys and Girls Club, which provides activities for area children.
It brought jobs that cut DeWitt's unemployment rate to 2.6% in February from 8% a decade earlier. During that time, oil and gas jobs here roughly doubled, according to the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association.
(For a graphic on employment in shale regions, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3g9ppn1)
EMPTY 'MAN CAMP'
The boom enabled bookkeeper Karen Jensen Zielonka to find work managing a new restaurant in 2015 and later gave her accounting work for Cuero Oilfield Lodging, a nearby ""man camp"" for transient workers. 
""When this first happened they said it would last 25 years,"" said Zielonka. 
But unemployment rose to 3.5% in March. Cuero Oilfield Lodging camp has been vacant since late March when shale jobs dried up, said manager Tammi Marks, who cut most of her staff.
""We’re doing a lot of praying,"" she said.
Officials here and in other U.S. shale patches are bracing for more cuts. The value of DeWitt's mineral properties could fall this year by half, from $5.3 billion last year, county chief executive Daryl Fowler estimated.
Officials do not expect to reduce county jobs, ""but it can happen,"" said Fowler. 
In the last oil bust, from 2015-2016, DeWitt's average incomes fell 31%. That drop was short-lived, with pay rising again by 2018. 
Oilfield worker Freddie Fuentes sailed through that period, without losing his job. He fears this one will sting much more.
""Right now we have about five weeks of work,"" said Fuentes. ""After that we're done."" 
FEARING A PROLONGED SLUMP 
Some drillers hope for a turnaround. Oil prices have bounced from the April bottom when U.S. crude ended one day in negative territory. Prices now are about half January's level. 
Lonestar Resources is putting oil in storage tanks that typically hold brackish water, said Chief Executive Frank Bracken, counting on a price rebound.
Still, Bracken said, ""royalty owners are going to see vastly diminished paychecks."" 
This year's crash might be much worse than recent downturns, said Amanda Weinstein, assistant professor of economics at the University of Akron, who has studied shale booms. Young people who lose jobs may ""feel like there’s not as much for them in that town anymore,"" and leave. 
Williston, North Dakota, center of the Bakken shale field, was so devastated by the 1980s bust that it lagged the nation in economic growth until shale started there around 2006, Weinstein said. 
At the Helena ghost town, oil royalties donated by Ruckman and others fixed a historic home whose porch had been propped up with a salvaged telephone pole. The historical society had hoped to spruce up the attraction with a visitor's pavilion and new restrooms, said Trip Ruckman, Paul Ruckman's cousin.
""Some plans are on hold given the situation,"" he said.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>",Deere signals recovery as U.S. farmers to benefit from relief program,"By Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -  Deere & Co  (N:DE) on Friday topped quarterly sales and profit estimates and forecast a smaller-than-expected fall in farm equipment sales for the year, signaling a recovery in demand for its harvesters and tractors. 
Shares of the company, which withdrew its outlook in March due to an escalating COVID-19 pandemic, rose as much as 4% in early trading.
Deere's fresh forecast comes more than a month after President Donald Trump announced a $19 billion relief program to help U.S. farmers cope with the impact of the health crisis. The company's sales were likely to benefit from the additional liquidity, analysts have said.
""Deere noted signs of stabilization (in farm equipment sales) despite the week farm sentiment,"" said Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Stephen Volkmann, adding that fiscal 2020 North American sales outlook of a decline of 10% was ""surprisingly benign"".
The company said it expects farm and turf equipment sales to fall between 10% and 15% this year. According to Jefferies, the midpoint is better than a 14% drop estimated by analysts.
Deere typically sees a pick-up in sales of farm equipment after January as farmers start planting fields. That likely helped second-quarter demand for farm machinery hold up better than sales of construction equipment.
It forecast 2020 profit in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion, down 39% to 51% from a year earlier.
In the quarter ended May 3, farm and turf machinery sales fell 18% to $5.97 billion and construction and forestry equipment sales dropped 25% to $2.26 billion.
Net income fell 41% to $666 million, or $2.11 per share in the quarter, but beat analysts' average estimate of $1.62 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Equipment sales declined 20% to $8.22 billion, topping expectation of $7.69 billion. (https://

1428,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 22, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",Deere Tractor Sales Hold Up in Pandemic Turmoil; Shares Gain,"(Bloomberg) -- Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co. shares rose after the top tractor maker navigated pandemic upheavals better than expected and surprised analysts by reinstating earnings guidance.
While sales and profit fell in the three months through April, the drop was less severe than analysts estimated as agriculture -- deemed essential in the lockdown era -- proves more resilient than many other industries.
Lower costs helped defend margins in a quarter that’s often Deere’s strongest as farmers buy planting equipment for the growing season. Even though supply-chain disruptions are weighing on its customers and the China trade deal is a wild card, Deere reported better pricing for its products through the quarter.
The company, which dropped annual guidance in March as it cut back operations amid the virus uncertainties, bucked an industry trend by providing a new forecast -- of $1.6 billion to $2 billion compared with the average estimate of $2.1 billion.
That would be a sharp drop from a year ago but the decision to reinstate guidance is positive, and may prove to be conservative given the solid quarter, said Chris Ciolino, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. Results showed “really just strong execution on the cost side and better pricing.”
Shares were up 1% at 9:43 a.m. in New York ahead of a 10 a.m. earnings call.
The cycle of farmers replacing aging farm machinery will persevere through near-term challenges like the trade war, tough growing conditions and the economic shutdown, according to Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold.
There are still supply chain issues, though not enough to derail sales and operations. Responding to customer demand “has been a challenge” due to “barriers,” the company said in a statement, noting the pandemic uncertainties could hurt its results and financial position in the future.
Defensive Play
The Moline, Illinois-based company is also shoring up its liquidity. It raised $4.5 billion in funding during the pandemic.
“Deere’s solid balance sheet, good credit metrics and management prudence are likely to help soften the impact of the virus outbreak, at least in the near term,” said Stephane Kovatchev, a credit analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.
Deere forecast its 2020 worldwide agriculture equipment sales to be down 10% to 15%, and said industry sales would decline 10% in the U.S. and Canada -- its biggest money-making region. It said construction and forestry equipment sales would drop 30% to 40%.
Fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings were $2.11 cents a share. compared with the $1.62 average estimate and $3.52 a year ago.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened Friday mostly lower but on course to notch their highest weekly close in over two months as hopes for a speedy summer rebound in the economy were tempered by sobering news out of China overnight. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 118 points, or 0.5%, at 24,356 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both down 0.4%.
Overnight, the National People's Congress - the annual gathering of the country's legislative assembly - produced two pieces of news with bearish implications for stocks: a regular government update that removed the country's annual growth target for the first time in three decades, which seeded worries about the ability of the world's second-largest economy to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic; and a draft law proposal that would impose tighter central control over Hong Kong, in defiance of the ""one country, two systems"" agreement that China promised to respect when it regained control of the former British colony.  
Any Chinese move to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy will result in ""very serious"" U.S. retaliation, President Donald Trump warned late on Thursday.
Chinese ADRs in New York were among the most active losers in early trade, with e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) falling 4.1% to its lowest in a week, despite posting revenue and earnings that were well ahead of expectations for the three months through April, despite a heavy loss on the company's investments. 
JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), which competes with Alibaba in online shopping, was down 3.1%, while search engine Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) ADRs were down 5.5% and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) stock was down 6.9%.
Domestic stocks fared slightly better, even those with direct or indirect exposure. Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), demand for whose machinery is conditioned to a big degree by Chinese export opportunities, rose 0.5% after posting quarterly results that were not as bad as feared, thanks largely to good cost control. 
However, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) stock fell 10.1% and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) stock fell 1.3% after both companies flagged major job cuts, anticipating structurally lower demand in the post-Covid-19 world.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese technology company NetEase (O:NTES) plans to carry out a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on June 11, which will be followed one week later by web retailer JD.com (O:JD), four sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The two transactions could raise a combined $5 billion, separate sources said, and the deals would be the largest for Hong Kong's equity capital markets so far this year.
The sources could not be named because the information has not yet been made public.
JD.com is expected to be the largest of the two deals with the likelihood it will sell 5% of its shares that could raise up to $3 billion, one source said, while NetEase is targeting a transaction of up to $2 billion, another source said.
A JD.com spokesman and a NetEase spokesman declined to comment.
The two Nasdaq-listed companies have made confidential filings to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and preparations for the secondary listings as well underway.
The decision to press ahead with the listings comes after the U.S Senate passed legislation on Wednesday that could prevent some Chinese companies from listing their shares on U.S. exchanges unless they follow standards for U.S. audits and regulations.

The proposed laws still need to be passed by the U.S House of Representatives and be ratified by President Donald Trump.

1433,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 22, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",A Gold Vault in London Is Key to a $62 Billion ETF’s Success,"(Bloomberg) -- Gold-backed ETFs are on pace for a record haul in a year that’s seen some funds tracking oil futures founder.
Investors have poured unprecedented amounts of cash into gold funds, with inflows totaling $16.8 billion in less than five months and set for a record year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. State Street’s $62 billion SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), ticker GLD, has taken in nearly $12 billion in 2020, ranking it third for worldwide ETF inflows behind two equity-focused funds.
Gold funds are drawing a surge in interest partly because they’re backed by actual bars of the precious metal, making them better able to track the underlying assets’ spot price when markets go haywire. Compare that with the futures-backed United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO), or USO, which was forced to take a series of unusual steps to survive amid a plunge in the crude contracts. WisdomTree suspended a swaps-based inverse oil offering in April, while Proshares Capital Markets liquidated two leveraged crude ETFs a month earlier.
“I would put a big line in between physically-backed commodity ETFs and the ones that use futures and have to roll them,” said Eric Balchunas, ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “In the worst case scenario, they deliver gold to your door. That’s a different situation than a barrel of oil.”
For George Milling-Stanley, chief gold strategist at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors’ SPDR ETFs business, part of GLD’s popularity stems from the trust investors have in the product, knowing that real gold backs up their holdings. Milling-Stanley helped create the fund back in 2004 while working at the World Gold Council.
“We found out early that the only way to guarantee that there’s no tracking error is to only own the underlying,” he said. “If you’ve got cash in there, you’re going to diverge from the course of the price of the underlying. So we decided we would have no cash, no derivatives, pure and simple 100% backed by gold.”
State Street’s gold is stored in a vault in London accredited by the London Bullion Market Association and three registered security carriers. The $63 billion stockpile takes up just one corner of a vault in an system that stores bullion on behalf of central banks, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutions, Milling-Stanley said.
Contrast that to USO, which was revealed to be far from a straight-forward bet on the direction of oil prices. After years of tracking the front-month oil contract, the fund repeatedly rolled forward its holdings to longer-dated futures and warned it may see “significant tracking deviations” to its benchmark. Its issuer has said it’s unclear if USO will ever be able to return to tracking the front-month contract.
The episode raised questions about how much of the oil futures market USO controls and its ability to impact prices. At different stages, the fund held about a fifth to a quarter of the May and June contracts. USO said on Thursday that its currently unable to buy more oil futures following intervention from regulators in three countries.
“With the synthetic ETFs, there is more of a tracking difference between what the underlying is and what the ETF’s unit price is, so that’s where investors probably need to do a bit more due diligence and understand the risks involved,” said Kanish Chugh, co-head of sales at ETF Securities.
The United States Commodity Funds, which manages USO and other commodity ETFs, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Slim Chances
Meanwhile, most gold ETFs are backed by the metal itself, instead of futures contracts, meaning the chance of a similar meltdown to USO is slim, Chugh said. The physical spot price of gold would have to become negative.
Although gold futures ETFs do exist, they’re much less popular than their physically-backed counterparts. For instance, Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) DB Gold Fund has $154 million in assets.
“The advantage of a futures-based ETF, if it works well, is there are no costs of holding and storing the commodity, but again the biggest risk is the ETF has to replace futures before they expire,” said Sylvia Jablonski, managing director of capital markets at Direxion Shares.
ETF Liquidity
For Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA Research’s head of ETF and mutual fund research, the benefits of the fund versus holding the actual gold is that the ETF is easier to trade and to add or reduce exposure during market hours -- compared to finding a buyer for bars of gold.
Inflows into gold funds are expected to continue this year amid worries about currency debasement due to unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve. Others fear the stock rebound will fade as economic data shows the dire impact coronavirus shutdowns have had on the nation’s economy.
Michael Cuggino has been adding gold to his holdings this year. Although his mutual fund owns physical gold, the portfolio manager at Pacific Heights Asset Management recognizes the benefits of the ETF format.
“Owning gold physically can be a hassle. You have to pay storage and insurance,” he said. “Those are spread across a wide range of investors in an ETF, provided they have physical gold.”

1434,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",Why bond investors are willing to bet on money-losing Pemex after oil price crash,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher and Rodrigo Campos
MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexico's state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos has seen investor sentiment improve in recent weeks despite sky-high debts, a slump in demand and no clear direction about how the government will turn the money-losing driller around.
Despite all the risks of holding the world's largest fallen angel, the ignominious distinction for a company that loses its investment-grade rating, bondholders are betting on continued support from the government.
""If we came to believe that sovereign support was less forthcoming, or that there was an effort to more fully separate the sovereign and the oil sector as independent entities, we would become more cautious,"" said James Barrineau, co-head of emerging market debt for the Americas at  Schroders  (LON:SDR).
Barrineau said that unlike other non-investment grade oil names, Pemex's ""importance to the sovereign means default risks are low."" 
Pemex bonds also remained a top pick for  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts who on Monday turned bullish on emerging market sovereign credit, with the Wall Street bank doubling down and closing the 5-year credit default swap trade it had as a hedge to its long Pemex call.
So far in May, spreads for the most highly traded Pemex bonds have narrowed by triple digits, MarketAxess data show, with the 2030 <71654QCT7=> tightening by 240 basis points and the January 2027  by almost 200. 
Late on Thursday the 2030 bonds traded at 89 cents with a yield of 8.97%, while the 2027 traded at 91 cents, their yield at 8.25%.
Pemex bond spreads have this month tightened at a steeper rate than those of both the sovereign and the benchmark emerging markets index <.JPMEGD>. 
With the Mexican sovereign spread to the U.S. 10-year among the widest in its credit rating category, expected tightening should further pressure Pemex yields lower, analysts and investors said.
Investors had initially punished Pemex, widely held by yield-hungry investors, and even the Mexican sovereign, because they said President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has given no credible plan of how he plans to turn around Pemex. 
Mexico's huge money-losing driller is run by Chief Executive Octavio Romero, who sticks to the government's position. 
Yet analysts and investors now say the company's dire straits harden the case for government support.
""Pemex would likely be the primary beneficiary of any fiscal relief effort (from the government),"" said Gustavo Rangel, chief economist for Latin America at ING. 
""In fact, the sharp drop in oil prices suggests that PEMEX should continue to struggle to deliver on its financial goals, increasing the need for continued financial assistance from the federal government.""
The slump in demand for oil on the world market has exacerbated Pemex's financial problems. 
The company is saddled with almost $105 billion in debt and more than $54 billion of unfunded pension liabilities, and late last month posted a loss of $23.6 billion, one of the largest for a single quarter in corporate history.
Jens Nystedt, senior portfolio manager at Emso Asset Management, said he upped his holdings of Pemex bonds through last month after the credit's ""junk"" status forced some investors to sell, driving down prices.
""A lot of people waited for that forced selling to show its hand before they were willing to take advantage of attractive yields and an attractive spread over the sovereign,"" said Nystedt.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to head lower Friday, as China threatened to crack down on Hong Kong’s autonomy, a move that could have significant consequences for relations between China and the West.
At 07:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 7 points, or 0.3%, lower, Nasdaq Futures down 34 points, or 0.4%. The Dow Futures contract fell 57 points, or 0.2%. These cash indices are up around 3% so far this week, and are on course for their highest weekly closes since early March.
Overnight, China announced plans to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong to tighten its grip on the semi-autonomous city, potentially threatening its favorable U.S. trading terms.
The Hang Seng, Hong Kong’s major equity index, closed 5.6% lower, its biggest drop in five years.
The decision drew a warning from President Donald Trump that Washington would react ""very strongly"" against the attempt to impose more control over the former British colony. The U.S. Senate piled in and introduced a bill with bipartisan support that would sanction Chinese officials - and any banks serving them - if they implement the law.
The move adds to the rapidly deteriorating relationship between the world’s two largest economies, and a serious confrontation begins to look more likely as both administrations seek to win over domestic audiences looking for someone to blame for a deterioration in living standards.
That said, losses on Wall Street aren’t seen as being too substantial Friday, kept within bounds by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's signal on Thursday that another coronavirus relief bill may not be too far away. 
""I think there's a high likelihood that we'll do another rescue package. ... We're not quite ready to intelligently lay down the next step, but it's not too far off,"" McConnell said during an interview with Fox News. 
The retail sector continues its earnings season Friday, with Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) set to report earnings before the bell.
Additionally, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) shares surged 6% preseason after the cybersecurity company’s quarterly results impressed, as did those of chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) gained 3.7% premarket after announcing it was resuming production at its U.S. manufacturing plants after suspending output for about two months.
Elsewhere, oil futures slumped, weighed by China’s decision to drop its target for gross domestic product growth for the first time in three decades, casting doubt on its demand for oil.
Baker Hughes will release its U.S. oil rig count at 1:00 PM ET. Last week the rig count dropped to 258 from 292 the week before.
At 7:20 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 6% lower at $31.88 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 4.9% to $34.30.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",France warns Renault could disappear; Nissan plans job cuts,"By Sudip Kar-Gupta and Naomi Tajitsu
PARIS/TOKYO (Reuters) - Europe's car industry was put on alert for more job losses on Friday as a French minister warned  Renault  could disappear if it didn't get help soon and a Japanese news report said partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY) was considering 20,000 layoffs, with many in Europe. 
Renault (PA:RENA) and Nissan (T:7201) have been in a carmaking alliance for the past two decades and are due to announce a strategy update next Wednesday. 
The plan was originally billed as a reset of their relationship, which was rocked by the November 2018 arrest in Japan of the alliance's architect and long-time boss Carlos Ghosn on charges of financial misconduct, which he denies. 
However, the update has taken on greater significance since the coronavirus pandemic hammered demand for vehicles and threw production into disarray. 
French finance minister Bruno Le Maire, who is considering a 5 billion euro ($5.5 billion) loan for Renault to help it through the crisis, warned on Friday the company's future was at stake.
""Yes, Renault could disappear,"" he told Europe 1 radio.
Le Maire said Renault's French plant in Flins mustn't close and the company should be able to keep as many jobs as possible in France, but also said it needed to adapt and be competitive.
Renault declined to comment on Le Maire's remarks.
The Flins factory, northwest of Paris, is where Renault makes its electric Zoe models and the Micra car for Nissan. It employed around 2,640 people at the end of 2018, according to Renault's website. 
The company has 40 plants and 13 logistics sites in 16 countries.
SCALING BACK
Kyodo, meanwhile, said Nissan might axe 20,000 jobs from its global workforce, mainly in Europe and developing countries.
Two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the number of cuts had not been finalised. 
Nissan declined to comment. 
The Japanese automaker said in July last year it would cut 12,500 employees, nearly 10% of its of 140,000-strong workforce. If it raises that figure to 20,000, it would broadly match the number of jobs it shed during the 2009 global financial crisis.
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month that Nissan's management had become convinced it needed to be much smaller and would likely cut 1 million cars from its annual sales target, while seeing a bigger role for the United States and China in car sales.
Sources have also said it plans to scale back its European business to focus on sport-utility and commercial vehicles, including possibly closing a plant in Spain, which employs around 3,000 people.
Hit by over-capacity, stiff competition and flagging demand, Europe's car industry has seen a steady stream of job losses, with Germany's Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_P) announcing in December up to 9,500 cuts at its Audi (DE:NSUG) brand. 
So far, most of the layoffs during the coronavirus crisis have been temporary, however, with companies taking advantage of government-backed furlough schemes.

1461,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Cabin crew union demands Lufthansa bailout safeguards jobs,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's airline cabin crew union called on Friday for Berlin to include measures to safeguard jobs in the bailout package which is being finalised for airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).
The UFO union said it was ""regrettable"" that negotiations with the government did not appear to involve provisions to preserve jobs at the German airline, which is burning cash as the coronavirus pandemic has grounded most of its flights.
Lufthansa is in advanced talks over a 9 billion euro ($9.8 billion) bailout with the government, which would involve Germany taking a 20% stake in the airline, but UFO said the plan would not ensure workers' rights.
""We would really wish that the government, when it provides money to help Lufthansa, would also help the employees,"" UFO spokesman Nicoley Baublies told Reuters TV.
""After all, it is taxpayers' money that has to be extended to workers so that they don't end up on the street, despite the money flowing,"" he added.
UFO members were prepared to accept hardship but only if jobs could be preserved under a different operating model which addressed social aspects, he said, adding that there was not enough evidence of ""decency and honesty"" being applied.
Once Berlin's economic stabilisation fund puts forward a final offer, Lufthansa's management and supervisory board will need to approve the deal.
A spokesman for Lufthansa declined to comment on the talks.

1462,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 22, 2020 06:09AM ET</span>","Ecstatic and Terrified, Americans Are Rushing Out of Their Homes","(Bloomberg) -- Customers keep popping into the New York City dry-cleaning shop where Rolando Matute works to say how happy they are to see it open again. He’s not so sure.
“I don’t really feel safe,” he said on Tuesday, his third day back at MCMB Cleaners in Harlem. “I’m dealing with a lot of clothes, a lot of credit cards and a lot of customers, but I feel like I have to because I have a family. Someone has to work.”
Americans locked at home for more than two months seem resigned to participating in a coronavirus experiment that begins in earnest this Memorial Day weekend, with all 50 states open at least in part. People are filling resorts, casting aside masks at the mall and weighing the dangers of a meal out. That freedom could revive an economy that has seen almost 39 million people file for unemployment over the past nine weeks, more than during the whole of the Great Recession.
However, many workers are anxious about returning during a pandemic in which cases have leveled off in many areas, but haven’t dropped as dramatically as many health experts would have liked.
Matute has moved into his basement in the Bronx out of fear of bringing the virus home to his wife, two daughters and asthmatic mother. His wife leaves his dinner on the back patio every night, alongside the food bowls for their two cats. His 3-year-old waves as he retrieves it.
“I’m like a cat, eating dinner on the patio,” said Matute, 36. “I don’t even go into the house anymore.”
Almost 94,000 Americans have already died from Covid-19 and another 50,000 might by August — if states don’t deviate from their announced plans to ease social distancing, according to the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
Without a coherent national strategy, Americans are confronting that grim prospect in different ways. People in hard-hit New York are cautiously stepping out and testing new social norms. In freewheeling Florida, hotel bookings in the Gulf Coast playground of Destin were down only 22% in the week ended May 16 compared with the same week last year, according to hospitality researcher STR. In early April, they were down 84%.
Fresh flare-ups of disease “will test our social fabric and bring these differences into relief,” said Ayman Fanous, chair of psychiatry at Brooklyn’s SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University. “Conflict is inevitable as people are just going to reach breaking point.”
Americans’ division over how to cope with the virus was starkly sketched this week in interviews around the nation:
If you don’t want to wear a mask, don’t even think about entering J’s Breakfast Club in Gary, Indiana. Joslyn Kelly is a stickler for Covid-19 safety rules.
Kelly ended takeout service at her soul-food restaurant early in the lock-down after customers failed to follow social-distancing measures. She lost a month of revenue before she resumed May 1, and business has been brisk enough that she put up a sign asking customers to be patient.
Kelly admits only a limited number of people, and only if they’re wearing a mask. Those who aren’t can pay $2 for one, or they can order curb-side delivery from their cars. Restaurants in Lake County were allowed to start reopening for dine-in service from May 18, but Kelly plans to wait another two weeks to take that step.
“We don’t need to be first in all this,” she said.
Other proprietors have eagerly welcomed all patrons desperately fleeing their homes. “They were so excited to be out at a restaurant and out in the world doing things,” said Christy Hackinson, who owns The Alley on Main restaurant in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. “Mainly what we heard from people was: Thank you so much for being open, for giving us a place to go.”
The piecemeal approach that the U.S. and various states have taken has angered many business owners, who yearn for safety guidance.
In North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Amy Howie was livid at not being allowed to reopen her Papillon Salon even as salons in Georgia snipped and curled — and South Carolina reopened its beaches. But when the governor opened salons May 18 she was “shocked” that the state issued only voluntary guidelines. Among them, staff “should strongly consider” wearing a face mask. Howie’s going further and taking people’s temperature at the door.
“We have not been given any orders,” she said.
In Jersey City, New Jersey, the manager of the Pet Shop vegetarian restaurant and bar wants better instructions from health officials. How are masked patrons supposed to drink and dine? How do bartenders mix drinks and also clear used — and potentially virus-tainted — glassware?
“We would have to change gloves between every customer,” said 37-year-old Jesse Madry. “That’s a lot of gloves and a lot of time, and I don’t know whether you’ve ever been in a bar, but people aren’t too keen on waiting for drinks.”
Trish Gleason of Huntsville reopened her shops April 30, five minutes after Alabama’s stay-at-home order ended.
Since then, sales at University Pickers and Redbird Boutique and Gifts are up over pre-Covid days by as much as 20%, Gleason said. Employees are wearing face masks, even if many customers aren’t.
“It’s just interesting to see how some people are over it and ready to get back to life, and luckily some of the states are allowing us to do just that,” she said. “The mask-wearing is how we were gauging people’s comfort. When we first opened up, 90% of people who came into the store had masks on. Now it’s less than 25%.”
In fact, Alabamians appear to be embracing reopening as much as anyone, by some measures. Restaurants are seating 70% fewer dine-in customers than they were a year ago, according to the OpenTable booking service. However, compare that with the 100% decline a few weeks ago. Only Oklahoma and South Carolina have recaptured more dine-in business among 37 states and Washington, D.C., according to the company.
 
Several hundred miles west, Tracy Vaught worries about how to enforce social distancing and mask-wearing at her four Houston-area restaurants.
That’s one reason she’s reopened only two for dine-in service: Hugo’s, a Mexican spot named after her husband, and an American bistro called Backstreet Café. She’s equipping employees with masks, gloves and sanitation stations and has trained them on distancing. All employees will have to test negative for the virus. She’s also placing masks at the entrance for patrons and asking them to wear them while walking to their tables or to the restroom.
So far, everyone’s complying. This being Texas, though, someone’s bound to object, and she’s decided not to make a fuss.
“The wild card is our guests,” Vaught said. “We can control how we do things and what our expectations of each other are. But, it’s the general public that you can’t coach.”
In Davis, California, Erin Arnold feels likes she’s doing five times the work for a quarter of the revenue at the Avid Reader.
She and her husband, a lawyer, bought the 30-year-old bookstore in February and watched sales nosedive with California’s shut-down. Sales are 25% of what they were before the virus hit, despite surging online orders. The couple also owns Avid and Co. toy store down the street. It has fared better in part because quarantined people are devouring puzzles.
“Puzzles were bananas,” Arnold said. “I started early on putting in massive orders for puzzles.”
Now, as Governor Gavin Newsom loosens rules that have kept Californians from suffering infections like residents of New York, New Orleans and other hot spots, her mother is cleaning the bookstore’s basement.
“There’s a lot of hopefulness,” she said. “I mean, you don’t clean the basement if you don’t think you’re going to stay open.”

1463,By Investing.com,"<span>May 22, 2020 05:47AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Chinese Double Blow Hits Europe,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The news out of China overnight has rattled European stock market on Friday, for two good reasons.
Firstly, the National People’s Congress, the country's legislative assembly, dropped its target for gross domestic product growth for the first time in three decades. At best, this could be interpreted as an admission of high uncertainty about the economic rebound from the pandemic.  More likely, many will see it as a sign that not only are the economic numbers out of China going to be embarrassing for the Communist Party for some time to come, but that information will be more and more restricted, making it harder and harder for both direct and portfolio investors to base their decisions on fact rather than guesswork.
ING’s Iris Pang said she still expects the Chinese economy to shrink by 1.5% this year, given the absence of any more decisive fiscal stimulus measures (she expects limits on local government borrowing to be raised later this year to stop any worse outcome).
Secondly, the imminent crackdown on Hong Kong’s autonomy sends a host of negative signal to global investors, raising the risk of more civil disorder and further economic contraction, and a long-term levelling-down of investor protections and freedoms in the former U.K. colony.
And that’s before one factors in the effect of the U.S. reaction. In addition to the largely symbolic sanctions bill proposed in the U.S. Senate on Thursday. Hong Kong’s access to the U.S. market now depends on Capitol Hill’s interpretation of how well China respects its autonomy. It should go without saying that any crackdown will have already weighed the costs and benefits, and would imply that Beijing has accepted a further deterioration of relations with the West as an acceptable price for greater domestic stability - even if that means a fresh trade war.
The Hang Seng's 5.6% drop on Friday doesn’t seem at all unwarranted against that backdrop.
In Europe, the first-round effects have been the usual ones. HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) were among the worst-performing banks in Europe, while Richemont, whose Hong Kong boutiques are disproportionately lucrative in normal times, also fell 3.1%. The benchmark Stoxx 600 fell 0.8%.
Investors have already positioned for hard times ahead.  Burberry  (LON:BRBY) stock – another one highly exposed to Chinese demand - rose 2.5% after the group released its fiscal 2020 results, which included the now familiar routine of suspending dividend payments, pulling guidance and reassuring on liquidity. Like many others, it expects the current quarter to mark the low point of the contraction, noting that half of its stores are still closed.
What Burberry had to say about current trends was nonetheless interesting, suggesting that Chinese sales may grow at the expense of other regions this year, as the collapse in outbound tourism redirects spending to the Chinese market.
The U.K. group said it was “encouraged by the recovery we are experiencing in Mainland China and Korea with cumulative sales in both markets since the beginning of April ahead of the prior year, albeit it is likely there is a benefit from some repatriation of spending in Mainland China.”
But it warned that that lack of tourism spending will be hard to make up.
“As government restrictions ease across the globe, consumers in different markets are likely to respond in distinct ways, with the travelling consumer likely to take longer to return. As a result, it could take some time for the luxury industry to recover to pre-crisis levels.”"

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said earlier in May that the group would shut down the main Vienna base of Lauda and bring in Ryanair jets instead unless staff agreed to a pay cut and a new labour agreement.
Austria's Vida union had refused to agree to Lauda's contract proposals as it said they would hit some staff hard. The union was not immediately available for comment on Friday.
Ryanair bought the Austrian airline from Former Formula One racing champion Niki Lauda in 2018 as part of a move to a broader structure with several airline brands. 

Lauda's Vienna base hosts 15 of the airline's 30 A320s. O'Leary has said he planned to keep Lauda's other bases in Stuttgart, Dusseldorf and Palma open.

E-commerce firms faced massive disruption in the initial days of the lockdown in India, but a slow easing of the stringent regulations has allowed them to resume large parts of their operations.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>","Nissan considering 20,000 job cuts, mainly in Europe, developing nations: Kyodo","TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) is considering cutting 20,000 jobs from its global workforce, focusing on Europe and developing countries, Kyodo news reported on Friday, as the Japanese automaker struggles to recover from plunging car sales. 
The possible cuts come as Nissan prepares to announce its updated mid-term strategy next week. Profits at the automaker have been floundering for the past three years, and the coronavirus pandemic has only piled on urgency and pressure to renew efforts to down size and turnaround the company. 
Nissan declined to comment on the Kyodo report. 
The automaker said in July last year it would cut 12,500 employees, nearly 10% of its of 140,000-strong workforce. If Nissan raises that to the higher figure, it would rival the 20,000 jobs it shed during the global financial crisis in 2009. 
Even before the spread of the coronavirus, Nissan's sales and profits had been slumping and it was burning through cash, forcing it to curtail an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn. 
As a result, it will focus on strengthening cooperation with France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211), to make better use of the regional and technological strengths of all three car makers, and consolidate production capabilities. 
France's finance minister on Friday said Renault's future was at stake if it does not get help very soon, while Mitsubishi earlier this week reported an 89% drop in annual profit in the year ended March 31. 
Reuters has reported that Nissan's management has become convinced it needs to be much smaller and will likely cut 1 million cars from its annual sales target, while seeing a bigger role for the United States and China in car sales.

Nissan also plans to scale back its European business and turn its focus to SUVs and commercial vehicles, Reuters has reported.

The notice, published on Thursday and reproduced in Hong Kong media on Friday, names  Credit Suisse  as the security agent, which means it will act on behalf of the banks behind the loan. A court hearing will be held on the island of Tortola on June 8.
Credit Suisse (S:CSGN) has proposed Grant Thornton be appointed as liquidators of Haode Investments Co., Mr Lu's private company, which is registered in the Virgin Islands.
Credit Suisse declined to comment. Luckin did not respond to calls or an emailed request for comment.
The banks behind the loan https://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-coffee-investigation-chairman/luckin-coffee-chairman-defaults-on-loan-surrenders-company-shares-idUSKBN21O21R are Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs (N:GS),  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS),  Barclays  (L:BARC), China International Capital Corporation and  Haitong International  Securities (HK:0665), people familiar with the matter have said.
Luckin's fortunes have crashed since an internal probe showed much of its 2019 sales were fabricated and overestimated by 2.2 billion yuan ($309 million). Haode then defaulted on the loan that had been secured by millions of Luckin shares.
The creditors seized control of the Luckin shares owned by Haode and used as collateral, a notice published by Goldman Sachs on April 6 said.
Goldman Sachs had been appointed to oversee the stock's sale but Luckin had been suspended from trading on the Nasdaq for more than a month until Wednesday night.
Luckin was told by the Nasdaq on Tuesday its shares would be delisted because of ""public concerns"" over the company.
Luckin said it would appeal the ruling and remain a listed stock until a decision is made, expected within two months.
Its Nasdaq-listed shares have cratered from a peak of $50.02 in January to the close of $2.01 on Thursday.

Investing.com - European stock markets sold off sharply at the open Friday as China published a draft law proposal that could spell the effective end of Hong Kong's special status, risking further civil disorder there and profound negative consequences for relations between China and the West, especially the U.S.
At 3:40 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.2% lower, France's CAC 40 was down 1.1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1.7%.
Overnight, China announced plans to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong to tighten its grip on the semi-autonomous city.
The decision drew a warning from President Donald Trump that Washington would react ""very strongly"" against the attempt to gain more control over the former British colony. The U.S. Senate published a bill with bipartisan support that would sanction Chinese officials who implement the law.
Washington has already stepped up its rhetoric against China over the coronavirus amid other points of difference in recent weeks. This has raised concerns that the trade deal signed between the two countries in January could soon be dismissed, bringing back the trade war which roiled the markets for much of last year.
Adding to the woe was the news that China has decided not to set an economic growth target for 2020, for the first time in decades, due to the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic. This has raised fears that the economic slowdown in the world's second largest economy could last longer than previously expected.
China-exposed stocks were among the hardest hit, with HSBC (LON:HSBA) falling 5.0% and  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) falling 4.0%. Luxury goods makers, who derive a large part of their sales from China and Hong Kong, were also hit, with Richemont (SIX:CFR), the owner of Cartier, falling 3.4% and Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) falling 1.9%.
In corporate news,  Renault  (PA:RENA) dropped 3.5% after France's Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said that the French carmaker could disappear if it does not get help very soon to cope with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. 
Close Brothers (LON:CBRO) fell 4.3% after the financial services company warned that its third-quarter earnings would be marked by impairment charges due to the pandemic.
Economic data releases are thin on the ground Friday, but what we have seen from the U.K. has been pretty dire. 
Britain's government borrowed more than it has done in any month on record in April, while retail sales fell by a record 18% as the coronavirus lockdowns hammered the economy.
The crude oil market sold off sharply at the end of a strong week, due to the news coming out of China, the largest importer of oil in the world.
At 3:40 AM ET, Crude Oil WTI Futures traded 6.6% lower at $31.68 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent Oil Futures contract fell 5.5% to $34.08.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Global shares tumbled on Friday as Hong Kong's political unrest returned as a flashpoint in fast-deteriorating U.S.-China relations, following Beijing's moves to impose a new security law on the city.
The Asian financial hub's benchmark Hang Seng index (HSI) sank 5% to a seven-week low, pulling MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) down 2.5%.
The CSI300 index of mainland Chinese shares (CSI300) dropped 1.9% while Japan's Nikkei (N225) lost 1%. Pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) were down 0.97% while e-mini futures for U.S. S&P500  lost 0.8%.
China is set to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong to tighten its grip on the semi-autonomous city.
The decision drew a warning from President Donald Trump that Washington would react ""very strongly"" against the attempt to gain more control over the former British colony.
""It is starting to look like a U.S.-China summer of discontent in the making,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp.
""So far, China's response has been relatively tame despite Trump's daily goading. That might be due so that policymakers can focus on the NPC, but there is always the possibility of a firmer response.""
Hong Kong activists called on Friday for people to rise up against Beijing's plans although a proposed midday march in the central financial district did not materialise.
The new Sino-U.S. rift comes amid already tense relations between the two superpowers after Washington stepped up its rhetoric against China over the coronavirus and other points of difference.
Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department delayed a report to Congress assessing whether Hong Kong enjoys sufficient autonomy from China to continue receiving special treatment from the United States.
Washington has ramped up criticism of China over the origins of the pandemic. Last week, it moved to block global chip supplies to blacklisted telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies, while the U.S. Senate passed legislation that could prevent some Chinese companies from listing their shares on U.S. exchanges.
Rising tensions are casting a pall over recent optimism that the worst of the pandemic's economic impact was already over in most developed countries.
The pace of recovery remains highly uncertain -- a point highlighted by China's decision not to set an economic growth target this year for the first time in decades.
While Beijing pledged more government support for the virus-hit economy, it set a target to create over 9 million urban jobs this year, down from a goal of at least 11 million in 2019 and the lowest since 2013.
""The absence of a GDP growth target for this year confirms that, as we expected, policymakers accept that, after the plunge in Q1, economic growth will be low for 2020 as a whole even with a significant sequential recovery in Q2-Q4,"" Oxford Economics said in a note to clients.
""The sizeable overall fiscal deficit target indicates significant policy support for the domestic recovery that we expect to continue despite the challenging external background. We expect year-on-year GDP growth to average 4% in H2.""
The worsening mood pushed riskier currencies lower, with the Australian dollar dropping 0.5% to $0.6531  and the euro easing 0.25% to $1.0922 (EUR=).
The safe-haven yen gained 0.15% to 107.45 per dollar .
The yen brushed off the Bank of Japan's new lending scheme to channel more money to small businesses, which mimics the U.S. Federal Reserve's ""Main Street"" programme.
The decision had been widely anticipated after the BOJ flagged the creation of the scheme last month. 

Oil prices also tumbled from a two-month peak with U.S. crude futures (CLc1) losing 7.3% to $31.44 per barrel.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",Full disclosure? Hedge funds navigate COVID health questions,"By Maiya Keidan and Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - As the hedge funds once clustered in London's Mayfair negotiate gyrating markets, they are facing a new line of investor questioning: who has contracted COVID-19?
With billions sometimes riding on the performance of one star manager, or a small constellation of talent, investor interest in delving into the medical status of staff -- a realm considered by many private -- is perhaps understandable during a pandemic.
""The important thing for managers is planning – what do they intend to do on the basis of when, not if, they get the virus,"" said one of three investors who told Reuters they wanted to be informed about any coronavirus infections at the hedge funds they invest with.
But most of Britain's hedge fund managers have no protocol for divulging such details and there are no specific legal requirements for them to do so, according to Samuel Brooks, a partner at law firm Macfarlanes.
As many infected by the novel coronavirus appear to show only mild symptoms, some hedge funds – normally based in the well-heeled west London enclave but now scattered and working from home – are taking a ‘need to know’ approach to staff health disclosures.
They say they would only tell investors if their top managers fell seriously ill, but not necessarily inform them of a mild infection, or if lower-ranking staff became sick, according to interviews.
""You have a duty to your investors to advise them should any of your key employees or senior management fall ill with anything that incapacitates them beyond a reasonable period of time,"" said Kristofer Tremaine, founder and CIO at trade finance hedge fund Kimura Capital.
""Admission to hospital with COVID-19 would fall into that category.""
James Sivyer, an analyst at hedge fund data and analysis firm HFM, said the consensus view among 25 hedge funds was that the disease was now so widespread that a mild case would almost be a non-event -- and none he had spoken with had notified or planned to notify end investors about such infections.
Regulated British finance firms are obliged to report any material issues impacting their businesses and have to pay ""due regard"" to the interests of their customers under Financial Conduct Authority rules.
Where funds can be managed by a variety of people, and are advertised as such, their obligation to notify investors about staff absences depends in part on their prospectus, succession plans and any individual agreements with investors, regulatory experts say.
""We sometimes see investment managers being required to provide this type of information because of how they have described the portfolio being run in their prospectus,"" said Devarshi Saksena, partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons.
The risks of having so many assets tied to the performance of one person or a small group of people -- known as 'key person risk' -- has long been an issue in the hedge fund industry, where a star manager can attract billions from investors.
Big, influential and early investors may manage such risks with additional agreements called side letters, that can allow for greater transparency, although some regulators have raised concerns about their use.
Nevertheless, some hedge funds are adamant that things would need to get critical before they divulge staff medical details. One portfolio manager, who declined to be named, said he would have to be at death's door before investors were informed.

""If I were going to die from it then, yes, we would tell our investors,"" he said.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>","Rudderless after a rally, stock markets look for next catalyst","By Saikat Chatterjee, Sujata Rao and Megan Davies
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets have shuffled up about 1% this month despite the world starting to re-open after the coronavirus-driven lockdowns and U.S. and European economic data showing glimmers of a recovery. 
The sideways movement is in sharp contrast to the roughly 30% rally in late March and April, when investors were able to shrug off far more dire economic data and look towards recovery backed by government support. 
In some ways, not much has changed in the world’s understanding of the coronavirus and its economic impact. Some investors, economists and public health experts have been warning for weeks that re-opening will be slow, vaccines will take months and the recovery will be prolonged. 
And yet, investors appear to be taking heed only now. 
In interviews, investors said the explanation partly lies in the failure of the market's collective wisdom. Stock markets misread how fast growth may rebound. And now they need a new catalyst, such as a vaccine or substantial new stimulus, before they can decide whether to flee or hold the course. But it is proving to be elusive.
""Markets have essentially been range bound for more than a month now waiting for a new driver to emerge,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz (DE:ALVG). He said that positive news on reopenings and vaccines were insufficient to compensate for the string of negative data and concerns about the sharpness of the recovery. 
The market's conundrum underscores a larger predicament facing global policymakers in the battle against the coronavirus. The $15 trillion-plus pledged in global stimulus inflated stock markets in April, as investors took heart that governments will not let the global economy completely melt down. But while the money kept economies afloat, it cannot engineer a recovery. 
For that, the virus must first be brought under control.

TUG OF WAR
Kasper Elmgreen, head of equities at Europe's largest asset manager, Amundi, described markets as caught in a ""tug of war"" between bull and bear forces.
Elmgreen described the bullish forces as ""the extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus that came much faster and more forcefully than during the past crisis."" 
On the other side, he said is persistent uncertainty over the pace and shape of economic and earnings recovery. Markets are being premature in pricing a return to normalcy even next year, he added. 
""If there is light at the end of the tunnel, corporates are not seeing it,"" said Elmgreen.
Indeed, measured against forward earnings, European and U.S. equities are trading back at early-March levels, when the COVID-19 impact was yet to be felt. 
But with the world economy predicted to witness its biggest contraction since the Great Depression, U.S. and European earnings should decline 40-45% in the second quarter, Refinitiv data shows.
Influential U.S. investors David Tepper and Stanley Druckenmiller recently described markets as overvalued and with terrible risk-reward. Druckenmiller dismissed V-recovery hopes as ""a fantasy"".

EARLY WARNINGS
To be sure, many investors and policymakers initially believed the economic impact of the crisis could be brief, supporting the market's optimism.
But the stock market has a history of missing warning signals. In the current crisis, too, signs that it was not going to be smooth sailing got downplayed. 
Paul O'Connor, head of multi-asset at Janus Henderson, said April ""wasn't a rally that said the world is feeling better about growth or a reappraisal of the macro environment."" 
Nervousness was evident all along in bond yields that didn't rise, gold's 7% price gain and investors' refusal to deploy the $4.7 trillion stashed in U.S. money market funds, he noted.
There were other loud warnings, too. 
Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said as early as March 3 that it would take at least 12-18 months until a coronavirus vaccine is ready to be deployed. On April 7, former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned against expecting a quick recovery, saying it was likely that activity will only be restarted gradually and may need to be slowed again if the virus resurges.
CUTTING RISK
The sobering calls are coming true. Experience of countries in Asia, which had dealt with the virus for longer than the West, show that even after months of lockdown, consumers won't necessarily head out en masse to dine or shop, reducing the likelihood of a V-shaped recovery.
A slow, U-shaped recovery, or worse, a W-shaped double-dip is now expected by 75% of the investors polled by Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)'s  securities division.
""We thought central bank interventions had taken out some of the tail risks in the market,"" said Wouter Sturkenboom, who helps formulate investment strategy for $350 billion in client assets at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Asset Management.
Sturkenboom added risk, including equities, to his portfolio during the March rout and stayed overweight through April. But last week he cut the weighting of risky assets by 7% in favour of cash and cash-like assets.  

""We worry that the initial bounce in growth will be smaller and more gradual than hoped for. The risk of a downside surprise looks about equal to the likelihood of an upside surprise at this point,"" Sturkenboom said.

1480,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 12:05AM ET</span>",Australia's Wesfarmers to shut or rebrand over 100 Target stores in virus slump,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian retail giant Wesfarmers Ltd (AX:WES) said it will close or rebrand nearly two-thirds of its  Target  department stores and take one-off charges totalling up to A$650 million ($426 million) as it reels from the coronavirus fallout.
The move strikes a blow to what was once among Australia's most durable retail brands and reflects the urgency of brick-and-mortar stores around the world to adapt as sweeping virus-related curbs on movement keep shoppers at home.
With 284 stores nationwide, Target is the country's largest department store network but its owner fast-tracked a review of operations in April after the shutdown intended to contain the virus accelerated a sales slump.
Wesfarmers said it will convert up to 92 Target stores to its low-cost Kmart department store chain, and shut up to another 75 Targets, leaving as few as 117 Target outlets.
The retailer will see an impairment charge of up to A$480 million to reflect a lower value of the Target brand and other assets, plus A$170 million, before tax, in inventory write-offs and other restructuring costs for the year ending June.
""The actions ... reflect our continued focus on investing in Kmart, a business with a compelling customer offer and strong competitive advantages, while also improving the viability of Target,"" Wesfarmers Managing Director Rob Scott said in a statement on Friday.
""For some time now the retail sector has seen significant structural change and disruption, and we expect this trend to continue.""
Target's problems were worsened by COVID-19 but began before the health crisis. In the six months to December, Target's sales dropped sharply as it lost business to low-cost rivals like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Kmart.
Wesfarmers' Target is not related to the U.S. chain Target Corp (N:TGT).

Wesfarmers shares were flat on Friday, versus a broader market (AXJO) decline of 0.7%.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) said on Thursday it was gradually restarting the transmission and motor lines at its Mexican facilities in Silao and Ramos Arizpe, while U.S. auto parts maker  Lear  Corp (N:LEA) also geared up for production.
GM Mexico said the assembly plants at Ramos Arizpe in the northern state of Coahuila, and Silao in the central state of Guanajuato, could restart operations on Friday depending on suppliers, and that it was assessing when to reopen plants in the central state of San Luis Potosi, and in Toluca, near Mexico City.
The steps to restart production are welcome news for the North American auto sector, with supply lines highly interconnected among the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Automotive factories in Mexico have been idled for weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected 59,567 people and killed 6,510 in Mexico so far.
GM staff returning to work in Mexico must use personal protective equipment at all times, keep a ""safe distance"" of 1.5 metres (4.9 feet) from each other, and have their temperatures checked when entering the plant, a message to workers showed. 
The government said last week that Mexico's automotive industry could exit the coronavirus lockdown before June 1 if firms had approved safety measures in place.
Auto parts makers that are crucial to the supply chains are also taking steps to reopen, such as Lear Corp, whose clients include  Ford Motor Co . (N:F)
Some employees at Lear's Rio Bravo plant in Ciudad Juarez on Mexico's northern border were told on Thursday to return to work on Friday for activities including safety training, according to a message seen by Reuters.
Four workers at the plant, which supplies car-seat trim covers for  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz and Ford's Mustangs and Explorers, said they were told to return on Friday.
Lear said all facilities in Mexico are currently closed, and that it is implementing health and safety protocols in preparation for reopening.
One of 42 sites Lear operates across Mexico, the Rio Bravo plant employs about 3,000 people and saw a coronavirus outbreak that killed 18 workers, the company has said.
Mexico's government issued guidelines on Monday for restarting operations in carmaking, mining and construction even as coronavirus deaths hit new highs.

""The reopening is happening as the pandemic is hitting the country hard,"" said Mauricio Usabiaga, economic development minister for Guanajuato, the state where Silao is located. ""We have to be very careful, prudent and conscientious.""

Investing.com – Asian stocks were down on Friday on the back of a Chinese proposal to implement controversial national security laws in Hong Kong.
China moved on reports that circulated on Thursday that it was planning national security laws for Hong Kong after pro-democracy protests engulfed the special administrative region in the second half of 2019.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said during the opening session of the National People’s Congress, “We will establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two special administrative regions [Hong Kong and Macau], and see that the governments of the two regions fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.” Li added that the government would push ahead with a plan to integrate Hong Kong with other cities in southern China.
China will improve national security in Hong Kong, Premier Li Keqiang said, a day after China announced dramatic plans to rein in dissent by writing a new law into the city’s charter.
The laws would ban secession, foreign interference, terrorism and all seditious activities aimed at toppling the central government and any external interference in Hong Kong.
The remarks prompted an immediate response from the United States, with President Donald Trump issuing a stern warning to China, “I don’t know what it [possible Chinese actions] is because nobody knows yet...[but] if it happens, we’ll address that issue very strongly.”
Two U.S. Senators are also preparing a bill to implement sanctions against entities involved in enforcing the law.

Economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic caused China’s government to avoid setting a formal GDP growth forecast for this year, while predicting a swelling budget deficit and setting a more modest target for employment expansion.
Every year, the State Council, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance release reports before the NPC opening ceremony. This year’s annual meeting, which was delayed by more than two months due to the coronavirus outbreak, will last for about a week and conclude on May 28.

1484,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 10:05PM ET</span>",Judgment on key aspect of Huawei CFO's extradition trial in Canada due next Wednesday,"By Moira Warburton
(Reuters) - A decision on a key legal aspect of the trial over whether Huawei Technologies Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou can be extradited to the United States from Canada will be announced next Wednesday, the British Columbia Supreme Court said on Thursday. 
Meng was arrested in December 2018 at Vancouver International Airport at the request of the United States on charges of bank fraud, and is accused of misleading HSBC about a Huawei Technologies Co Ltd-owned [HWT.UL]company's dealings with Iran.
Meng, 48, has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition.
The case has strained relations between Ottawa and Beijing.
The judgment will deal with the charge of double criminality, deciding whether Meng's actions were crimes in both Canada and the United States at the time of her arrest.
Meng's lawyers argued that unlike the United States, Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized the start of the extradition process, meaning Meng's arrest did not meet the legal standard of double criminality.
Canadian prosecutors have argued that Meng should be extradited on fraud charges, and that contrary to her defense argument, the case is not solely about a violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.
Should the judge rule that Meng's actions were not a crime in Canada, the rest of the case ""dies,"" said Gary Botting, a criminal defense lawyer and extradition expert based in Vancouver. ""If the double-criminality standard falls, she gets to go home. Not just walk but fly.""
Arguments on the double-criminality charge took place in January in Vancouver.
A court memo on Thursday said British Columbia Supreme Court Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes would preside over an in-person court appearance by Meng and the other parties, once the decision is released at 11 a.m. PDT (1800 GMT) next Wednesday.
A second phase of the trial, focusing on abuse of process and whether Canadian officials followed the law while arresting Meng, is set to begin in June. Closing arguments are expected in the last week of September and the first week of October.

It could be years before a final decision is reached, since Canada's justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said on Friday that litigation funders will be required to hold an Australian financial services provider licence within three months, increasing transparency and accountability of the sector.
The class action industry in Australia had a later start than in the United States but has grown quickly since legal changes allowed for such lawsuits in 1992, helped by a favourable regulatory environment. 
Frydenberg said removing the licence exemption for litigation funders, which are currently categorised as a managed investment scheme, would ensure they ""operate transparently, are appropriately regulated and accountable.""
Litigation funders provide financing for lawsuits in exchange for a share of any settlement or judgment. If the litigant loses, it does not have to repay the financial investor.
Companies such as Omni Bridgeway Ltd (AX:OBL), formerly IMF Bentham, and Maurice Blackburn, have funded more than 300 class action suits in Australia, including against the country's major banks.
About 49% of class actions filed in the Federal Court were funded by third-party litigation funders in the three years to September 2016, but that rose to 78% in 2018, the Sydney Morning Herald reported, citing government estimates.
The clampdown comes just a week after the government announced a parliamentary committee inquiry into the class action industry, which is due to report in December. 
Launching the inquiry, Attorney-General Christian Porter said in many cases, funders were taking up to 30% of legal settlements, ""leaving members of the action to fight over the scraps that remain"" after legal fees and other costs were paid.

(Reuters) -  Nvidia Corp  (O:NVDA) on Thursday forecast second-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, as demand surges for its chips used in the data centers that power the shift to working remotely because of the new coronavirus outbreak. 
The company said the forecast includes a contribution from its $6.9 billion purchase of Israeli chip firm Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) Technologies Ltd, which strengthened its data center business.
The chipmaker said it expects current quarter revenue of $3.65 billion, plus or minus 2%, while analysts on average were expecting $3.29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Shares rose 0.4% in after-hours trading after the results were announced.
Much like rivals  Intel Corp  (O:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (O:AMD), Nvidia recorded a jump in demand for data center chips as companies invested to strengthen their IT infrastructure to support employees working remotely. Nvidia also said that sales to cloud computing companies drove its data center results.
Revenue rose 39% to $3.08 billion in the first quarter ended April 26, with the data center business recording its first $1 billion quarter, the company said. Nvidia's data center business hit $1.14 billion, up 80 percent from a year earlier. The segment beat analyst estimates of $1.07 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Nvidia's data center chips power functions such as search suggestions, product recommendations and artificial intelligence work such as speech and image recognition.
But some of Nvidia's market segments were hurt by the pandemic. The company expects sales to automotive customers to fall 40% next quarter. But Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview that some of those companies were also investing in robotics for the future, with Nvidia supplying the chips.
""The manufacturing companies are impacted, but they're racing to work on robotics technology so they can be less impacted in the future,"" Huang told Reuters.

Nvidia's net income rose to $917 million, or $1.47 per share, from $394 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.

YPSILANTI, Mich. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump traveled on Thursday to the crucial U.S. election battleground state of Michigan to visit a  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) plant amid tensions with its Democratic governor during the coronavirus pandemic, opting not to wear a protective face mask for the cameras.
Trump toured the Ford plant, which has been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment, and held a roundtable discussion with African-American leaders concerning vulnerable populations hit by the virus.
Trump, who has said he is taking a drug not proven effective for the coronavirus after two White House staffers tested positive in recent weeks, did not wear a mask during any of his public events at the plant in the city of Ypsilanti even though Ford on Tuesday reiterated its policy that all visitors must wear them.
Trump has consistently disregarded guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging people to wear masks in close company to try to curb the spread of the virus.
Surrounded by Ford executives wearing masks, Trump told reporters he had put one on out of the view of cameras. 
""I had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,"" Trump said.
When asked if Trump was told it was acceptable not to wear a mask in the plant, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said, ""It's up to him.""
""Honestly I think I look better in a mask,"" Trump added jokingly. 
The company later said in a statement that the chairman had ""encouraged"" Trump to wear a mask when he arrived, adding that the President had obliged during a private viewing of three two-seater Ford GT sports cars but then removed the face covering for the rest of the visit. 
Trump, a Republican seeking re-election on Nov. 3, has urged states to loosen coronavirus-related restrictions so the battered U.S. economy can recover even as public health experts warn that premature relaxation of restrictions could lead to a second wave of infections. 
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, is facing a backlash from some critics against her stay-at-home orders in a state hit hard by the last recession. Trump has encouraged anti-lockdown protests against Whitmer held in Michigan's capital.
Whitmer, whose state has been hit by devastating floods, on Thursday moved to further reopen Michigan's economy through a series of executive orders.
Trump on Wednesday threatened to withhold federal funding from Michigan over its plan for expanded mail-in voting, saying without offering evidence that the practice could lead to voter fraud - though he later appeared to back off the threat. 
At the plant, Trump repeated his assertion. ""Voting by mail is wrought with fraud and abuse."" Democrats have accused Republicans of pursuing voter suppression policies aimed at voters who tend to back Democrats.
Trump on Thursday pledged federal support to help with the ""very bad"" dam breaks in Michigan. Rising floodwaters have displaced thousands of residents near the city of Midland.
Whitmer spoke with Trump on Wednesday.
""I made the case that, you know, we all have to be on the same page here. We've got to stop demonizing one another and really focus on the fact that the common enemy is the virus. And now it's a natural disaster,"" Whitmer told CBS News, describing her conversation with Trump. 
Whitmer added, ""Threatening to take money away from a state that is hurting as bad as we are right now is just scary, and I think something that is unacceptable."" 
During the roundtable discussion, Trump said he expected the CDC to put out guidance on reopening places of worship as soon as Thursday. Trump, whose conservative political base includes evangelical Christian voters, spoke on the need to reopen churches, which like other parts of society have been affected by social distancing policies during the pandemic. 

Trump won in Michigan in the 2016 election, the first Republican to do since 1988.

LONDON (Reuters) - EasyJet's (L:EZJ) board looks poised to win a shareholder vote on Friday and deal a blow to its founder and long-term critic over the British low-cost airline's plan to stick with a $5.5 billion plane order. 
Stelios Haji-Ioannou, whose family is easyJet's biggest investor with a 34% stake, wants to oust the CEO, finance chief, chairman and another director, arguing their plan for the airline to buy 107 new Airbus aircraft could bankrupt it. 
Three of the company's bigger investors, with a combined 15% stake, have backed Chief Executive Johan Lundgren, and he says he has spoken to about 45% of the shareholder base who have all given him their support.
The resolutions put forward by Haji-Ioannou need the backing of 50% plus one share of the votes. 
Lundgren said the company line was also endorsed by three shareholder advisory bodies. ""This .. underscores the strength of the actions taken to date by the board and management to safeguard the financial and operational stability of the airline,"" he said this month.
The preliminary outcome of the vote will be announced during the virtual shareholder meeting which starts on Friday at 0900 GMT, with the final result expected later in the day. 
Haji-Ioannou has argued for a decade that easyJet's fleet expansion destroys shareholder value. After the coronavirus outbreak grounded planes, he stepped up his battle, arguing the latest order does not make sense during a downturn.
EasyJet has said it has sufficient liquidity for a prolonged grounding during the pandemic. It has deferred the order of 24 of the new Airbus (PA:AIR) planes, and said the contract is vital as older aircraft need replacing.
Haji-Ioannou has gone so far as to offer a 5 million pound ($6.1 million) reward to anyone with information that could lead to the cancellation of the order.

Having founded easyJet in 1995, Haji-Ioannou quit the board in 2010 and voted against buying new planes in 2013. In 2012, his attempt to remove previous chairman Mike Rake failed.

Investing.com - Stocks ended the day lower as the ghost of U.S.-China animosity returned to spook investors.
Tomorrow there will be more on that front, including major earnings and possible actions from Washington against Beijing over Hong Kong.
There will also be oil data at a time when prices are catching the eye of producers, even as demand remains depressed.
Here are the three things that could move markets tomorrow.
1.  Alibaba , Deere Set to Report
Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) will report earnings before the bell tomorrow.
Analysts are expecting a profit of 6.07 yuan a share on sales of about 107.5 billion yuan, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The results should give the market some idea of how the Chinese economy is emerging from the pandemic. There could also be some insight into the worsening U.S.-China relations and if Alibaba could allow further disclosure of its financials to the SEC following the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.
Chinese search engine company Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is considering delisting from the Nasdaq as tensions between the two nations rise, Reuters reported citing sources.
Also issuing numbers will be agriculture equipment maker Deere, which withdrew full-year 2020 guidance due to Covid-19 in March.
Deere (NYSE:DE) is forecast to post a profit of $1.91 per share and sales of about $8 billion.
2. U.S. Senate to Fire Back at China Over Hong Kong?
As the market looks like it may revert to its old habit of following back-and-forth between China and the U.S. for direction, investors will be watching for any more volleys about Hong Kong.
Senators are looking to introduce quickly a bipartisan bill that would sanction Chinese party officials and entities enforcing the new national-security laws in Hong Kong, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen and Republican Senator Pat Toomey will be urging Senate leaders to take up the matter quickly, the Journal said.
3. Oil Rig Count on Tap
Oil prices settled higher today, pushing WTI closer to $35 per barrel as hedge fund money chases the recent rally in prices.
Tomorrow brings the latest figures on oil rigs in operation, which will be of particular interest given that prices are reaching levels that could prompt companies to resume more production.
Baker Hughes will release its U.S. oil rig count tomorrow at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT).

Le Maire told newspaper Le Figaro that the government was seeking commitments from carmakers in three areas in return for help: electric vehicles; the fair treatment of sub-contractors; and that they base hi-tech activities in France.
""Renault is fighting for its survival,"" Le Maire said in the interview published late on Thursday. ""I haven't yet signed the loan.""
Sources told Reuters on Monday that Renault had reached an agreement on the loan with banks and that it should be submitted to the board of directors soon, before being formally approved by the finance ministry. 
Le Maire said France's response to the worst depression since World War Two totalled 450 billion euros in aid and state guarantees - 20% of France's annual national output. 
The government forecasts the euro zone's second-biggest economy will shrink at least 8% this year. Its budget deficit is set to hit a post-war record of 9% of economic output this year.
The European Union has granted member countries all the fiscal leeway they need to deal with the economic impact of the coronavirus, enabling governments to open the spending taps and wave aside EU budget rules that limit government borrowing.
There is no time limit set in the flexibility clause allowing this. Nonetheless, Le Maire said he hoped the rules would remain suspended in 2021.
""Nothing would be worse than reviving the economic machine while applying the brake on public spending,"" he said.

BENGALURU/LONDON (Reuters) - The United States has secured almost a third of the first one billion doses planned for AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN)'s experimental COVID-19 vaccine by pledging up to $1.2 billion, as world powers scramble for medicines to get their economies back to work.
While not proven to be effective against the coronavirus, vaccines are seen by world leaders as the only real way to restart their stalled economies, and even to get an edge over global competitors.
After President Donald Trump demanded a vaccine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services agreed to provide up to $1.2 billion to accelerate British drugmaker AstraZeneca's (L:AZN) vaccine development and secure 300 million doses for the United States.
""This contract with AstraZeneca is a major milestone in Operation Warp Speed's work toward a safe, effective, widely available vaccine by 2021,"" U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said.
The vaccine, previously known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and now as AZD1222, was developed by the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca. Immunity to the new coronavirus is uncertain and so the use of vaccines unclear.
The U.S. deal allows a late-stage - Phase III - clinical trial of the vaccine with 30,000 people in the United States. 
Cambridge, England-based AstraZeneca said it had concluded agreements for at least 400 million doses of the vaccine and secured manufacturing capacity for 1 billion doses, with first deliveries due to begin in September.
Now the most valuable company on Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 Index, it has already agreed to deliver 100 million doses to people in Britain, with 30 million as soon as September. Ministers have promised Britain will get first access to the vaccine.

VACCINE SCRAMBLE
With leaders across the world surveying some of the worst economic destruction since at least World War Two, and the deaths of more than 327,000, many are scrambling for a vaccine.
The U.S. government has already struck deals to support vaccine development with Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (N:JNJ),  Moderna  (O:MRNA) and Sanofi (PA:SASY), sparking fears the richest countries will be able to protect their citizens first.
Sanofi's chief angered the French government earlier this month when he said vaccine doses produced in the United States could go to U.S. patients first, given the country had supported the research financially. 
""We have a lot of things happening on the vaccine front or the therapeutic front,"" Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the AstraZenca announcement. ""You're going to have a lot of big announcements over the next week or two,"" on therapeutics.
AstraZeneca said it was in talks with governments and partners around the world - such as the Serum Institute of India - to increase access and production, and is speaking to various organisations on the fair allocation and distribution of the vaccine.
""We would like to thank the U.S. and UK governments for their substantial support to accelerate the development and production of the vaccine,"" AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said.
The Serum Institute of India, the world's largest maker of vaccines by volume, has dedicated one of its facilities with a capacity to produce up to 400 million doses annually to producing the Oxford vaccine.
""We are scaling up on a conservative basis of about 4 to 5 million doses a month to begin with,"" Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters, adding the company was in discussions with AstraZeneca.
COVID-19 PROTECTION?
A Phase I/II clinical trial of AZD1222 began last month to assess safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in over 1,000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years across several trial centres in southern England. Data from the trial is expected shortly.
There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19. 
Governments, drugmakers and researchers are working on around 100 programmes, and experts are predicting a safe, effective means of preventing the disease could take 12 to 18 months to develop. 
Only a handful of the vaccines in development have advanced to human trials, an indicator of safety and efficacy, and the stage at which most fail.
""AstraZeneca recognises that the vaccine may not work but is committed to progressing the clinical program with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk,"" it said.
Other drugmakers including  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) , J&J and Sanofi are also in various stages of vaccine development.
U.S.-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals (O:INO) said on Wednesday its experimental vaccine produced protective antibodies and immune system responses in mice and guinea pigs.

And Moderna this week released positive data for its potential vaccine, which it said produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers.

1500,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2020 04:27PM ET</span>",Financial Stocks’ $1 Trillion Wipeout Brings Echoes of 2008,"(Bloomberg) -- After years of stress testing, financial companies might have been better positioned to withstand a market shock such as that triggered by the coronavirus. Instead, they’re standing out as persistent losers.
Down 29% since January, banks and insurers have trailed the S&P 500 by 20 percentage points, their worst performance at this point of a year on record. Along the way, about $1 trillion has been wiped off their market value, an amount that rivals the annual total of $1.2 trillion seen at the depths of the global financial crisis.
While companies in economically-sensitive industries like energy have led the S&P 500’s two-month rebound, banks are stubborn laggards, held back by fears over everything from negative interest rates to dividend cuts and loan defaults. Despite those headwinds, some analysts are perplexed by the selloff. Bank profits are likely to take a hit, but the duration and magnitude pales in comparison to what happened in the 2008-2009 meltdown, estimates show.
“Today, there’s a night-and-day difference for the banks,” Mike Mayo, an analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co., said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Vonnie Quinn. By his count, banks have doubled the amount of equity on their balance sheets over the past decade and boosted liquidity by 50%.
“They are more resilient than they have been for a generation, but they are still treated like it is 2008. That’s a mistake the market is making,” he said.
The trajectory of future profits also points to a less gloomy picture. Back then, earnings worsened for eight straight quarters, turning into a huge loss at the end of 2008. Now, analysts expect the industry to see profit declines last half as long, with losses spared.
None of this brings much comfort to investors who just spent 13 years nursing losses from the financial crisis and didn’t break even until last December. Banks trailed all major industries except energy when the S&P 500 tumbled into its fastest bear market in March. While beaten-down stocks have since bounced back, lenders and insurers remain as the second-worst performers.
The lousy returns on the way up contrast with past patterns, where financial stocks came out as front-runners during initial rallies from the last three bear markets. Sure, the March low may not hold, and financials’ unerperformance can be viewed as a signal that the worst is not over. Still, to some, their constant inability to keep up with the market is puzzling.
“Financials had been an underperformer during the 2/19-3/23 bear market sequence. That’s understandable,” Julian Emanuel, a strategist at BTIG, wrote in a note last week. “Less understandable is the continuing underperformance.”
Put some blame on fears over negative interest rates. While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has shied away from that policy tool, negative rates have crippled Europe’s banks in the last six years by hurting profit margins. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has warned about “huge adverse consequences” of negative rates.
Dividend cuts may be a more immediate risk. After eight major U.S. banks agreed to suspend share buybacks through the second quarter to support clients during the pandemic, analysts have expressed concern about the safety of their dividends.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s dividend is most at risk in a bear case. Atlantic Equities downgraded Wells Fargo due to the looming specter of a lower dividend. Earlier this month, Fed Governor Randal Quarles said the Fed could curtail Wall Street banks’ ability to pay dividends by cranking up the amount of capital they need to maintain due to the pandemic.
On Thursday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC that banks should be preserving as much capital as they can, and “need to think very deeply about the extent to which doing dividends or paying out dividends is going to be helpful.” He added that “I would hope that many of them decide that it is not exactly the best think at this time.”
Concern about dividends may be overblown, according to Tony DeSpirito, a portfolio manager at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
“Monetary authorities have disavowed the idea of negative interest rates. We have held to zero as the lower bound and that’s a big deal for banks,” DeSpirito said in a Bloomberg TV interview with Jonathan Ferro (NYSE:FOE). “When I look at the dividends, I think they are more safe and sound in the U.S. than in Europe.”
Dividends are probably “broadly safe” for 90% of banks, and any cut may depend on the Fed’s annual stress test in June, KBW analysts led by Christopher McGratty wrote in recent notes.
At a time when growth stocks like technology are all the rage, it’s hard to get excited about banks, but their valuations make them a good bet on an economic recovery, said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. At 1.1 times book value, the cohort is trading at the deepest discount to the S&P 500 since 2009.
“If there’s one area in value that we prefer, it is the banks,” Nick said. “We think if and when the economy gets rolling again -- whether it’s the second half of this year or sometime in 2021 -- the valuations are extremely compelling.”

Investing.com - Chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on Thursday reported first-quarter results that topped expectations as solid performance in its fast-growing data center business helped offset weakness in its gaming business.
Nvidia shares lost 0.86% in after-hours trade following the report.
Nvidia announced earnings per share of $1.80 on revenue of $3.08 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.66 on revenue of $2.97 billion. That compared with an EPS of $0.88 on revenue of $2.22 billion in the same period a year before. Nvidia had reported EPS of $1.89 on revenue of $3.11 billion in the previous quarter.
Gaming, which accounts for the bulk of the growth, reported revenue of $1.34 billion, down 10% sequentially and up 27% from a year earlier. Data center revenue was $1.14 billion, up 18% sequentially, and up 80% from a year earlier.
For the fiscal second quarter, the company forecast revenue of $3.65 billion, give or take 2%. That was above estimates from Investing.com for $3.19 billion.
""Nvidia earnings are very much in line with expectations, showing strong demand from cloud-computing and its gaming segments. Sales from data centers were up 80% Y/Y as a stay-at-home environment playing a major role here,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. ""The company’s guidance for the current quarter is also quite strong suggesting that the chipmaker doesn’t see much impact from the Covid-19 on its business.""

Investing.com –  The Dow closed lower on Thursday, but remained on track for a weekly win as energy and technology stocks racked up losses amid souring investor sentiment on another wave of U.S. jobless claims and rising U.S. and China tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.41%, or 102 points, the S&P 500 slipped 0.78%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.97%.
The U.S. Labor Department reported that workers filed 2.438 million new unemployment claims last week, just above forecasts of 2.4 million, but below the prior week's downwardly revised 2.687 million.
The ongoing slowdown in jobless claims, however, may not yet indicate a bottom has been reached as continuing claims continue to rise, Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said.
The decline on Wall Street was led by energy even as oil prices ended the day up, as investors digested bearish news from companies in the sector.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) were among the biggest losers, with the latter down 6.7% after announcing it would scrap its dividend to conserve cash.
Technology, meanwhile, was led the lower by FAANG stocks, but Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) proved the exception to the selling, up 0.6% on the day. Chip stocks were also shunned, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down more than 2%  ahead of earnings from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) later today. 
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors continued to digest mixed quarterly results.
 Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY) fell 4.35% even as the electronics retailer reported first-quarter earnings that topped expectations.
 Expedia  (NASDAQ:EXPE) reported mixed results as losses widened by more than expected while revenue topped estimates, sending its shares about 3.43% lower.
BJs Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ) jumped 21.7% after its first-quarter results topped estimates, with comparable-club sales surging 27% as the coronavirus pandemic increased demand.
Elsewhere, cruise line companies  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) moved sharply higher as  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said the shares were attractive as the risk of a liquidity crunch was partially priced in.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) cut losses to trade 1.5% higher on a CNBC report the electric automaker will return to normal operations following disruptions caused by the pandemic.
Boeing (NYSE:BA), meanwhile, was up 4.25% after RBC initiated coverage on the stock at outperform rating, citing a favorable risk-to-reward opportunity.
Investor sentiment was also soured by rising U.S. and China tensions after the U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a bill to allow oversight of foreign-based companies."
1503,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Mexico ready to negotiate over power market shake-up,"By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president on Thursday said he was ready to negotiate over changes to the electricity market that angered firms and foreign allies, opening the door to a potential compromise that could ease tensions over energy policy.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to strengthen the state's role in energy production, saying previous ""neo-liberal"" governments handed too much control to the private sector at the expense of consumers.
Measures taken by the government in recent weeks to reduce the influence of private energy producers provoked protests from the European Union, Canada and Mexico's most powerful business associations.
The leftist Lopez Obrador was more conciliatory on Thursday than he was previously, when he lashed out at the criticism.
""We're open to dialogue with everyone, but the national interest will be put first,"" he told a news conference, stressing Mexico would defend its position in court if necessary.
On Friday, the EU and Canada raised concerns about an April 29 order suspending operation of new renewable plants on the grounds the government needed to safeguard power supply during the coronavirus outbreak.
That evening, Mexico published new rules giving the state more control over approval of new renewable energy projects, intensifying concerns the administration was violating existing contracts and bent on squeezing out companies.
Lopez Obrador said the government was not expropriating anyone and only wanted ""fair prices"".
""Because paying extra for electricity means the consumers, the people, have to pay more,"" he added.
The president has pledged to revive state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and national power company the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE). He said previous contracts imposed onerous financial terms on the state.
The electricity dispute follows a spat last year over several natural gas pipeline contracts the government said were costing Mexico too much.
After weeks of talks, the dispute was resolved under revised terms the government said would benefit taxpayers. 
According to officials and energy experts, the government wants to secure more favorable terms for the CFE in contracts with companies, while gaining more power over nominally independent regulators in how the market operates.
Critics contend that by restricting growth in renewable energy, the CFE will be able to use up fuel oil produced by Pemex that has become harder to sell on the open market.
The steps have rattled investors, depressing energy stocks. IEnova, a Mexican unit of U.S. firm  Sempra Energy  (NYSE:SRE), hit a six-year low on Wednesday.
IEnova's shares recovered some losses on Thursday.

(Reuters) - A group of U.S. senators is urging Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) to immediately reverse their decisions to reduce employees' hours, calling them contrary to the requirements of taxpayer-funded payroll assistance.
Delta and JetBlue have already received a portion of $25 billion in CARES Act money meant to protect airline workers' jobs and pay rates until Sept. 30 as the industry weathers a severe business slump during the coronavirus crisis.
Delta is set to receive $5.4 billion and JetBlue $935 million.
""You should not take one penny more of bailout funds unless you are prepared to protect your workers' jobs, pay and benefits,"" 13 senators including Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, all Democrats, wrote to the airlines in two letters.
They said cutting employee hours was potentially illegal.
""Delta's work hour reductions, which comply with the CARES Act, ultimately protect jobs,"" Delta said in a statement.
JetBlue spokesman Philip Stewart said the move was in full compliance, adding that with flights to many cities suspended or significantly reduced, ""there are quite literally no hours for our crewmembers to work in many cases."" 
With airlines bleeding cash, Stewart said payroll aid falls short of total payroll needs and that with little new revenue, JetBlue needs to make it last until Sept. 30 so it can preserve as many jobs as possible in October.
United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) rolled back its plan to cut working hours for thousands of union aircraft and passenger service workers after their union filed a lawsuit seeking a halt to the plan.
""You should do the same,"" the letters said.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian reinsurer  IRB Brasil Resseguros  SA (SA:IRBR3) is in advanced negotiations to buy rivals' portfolios in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America as foreign competitors scale back in the region, two sources close to the company told Reuters.
Any such acquisition would be a bold move for IRB given that the reinsurer revealed last week it was being inspected by the country's insurance regulator for potential liquidity problems as it fell short of assets to cover technical provisions. 
The inspection was the latest headwind to hit the insurer, which earlier this year replaced both its chief executive and chief financial officer after false reports that  Berkshire Hathaway Inc 's (N:BRKa) had acquired a stake.
IRB shares have lost about 80% this year but the sources said it has maintained a cash position of around 4 billion reais, including liquid assets.
With the region's economy side-swiped by the coronavirus-linked economic crisis, some global reinsurers are leaving or decreasing operations in Latin America to focus on their main markets in the United States and Europe, one source said, without revealing names.
""IRB is negotiating the purchase of portfolios and making alliances with more insurers,"" another source said, requesting anonymity, because the matter is not public.
Although there are about a hundred reinsurers authorized to operate in Brazil, IRB holds a roughly 40% market share, with other top players including Munich Re,  Swiss Re  AG (S:SRENH) and Chubb Ltd (BN:CB). 
In coming weeks, IRB will reveal more details on issues including technical provisions ahead of its first quarter results, scheduled for June 18, according to one of the sources. 
IRB said in a statement that ""it is constantly assessing possible operations in Brazil and abroad that are in line with its business strategy.""
Asked about potential disclosures about balance sheet-related issues, IRB said ""it will timely communicate facts or decisions judged by companies that are of interest to its shareholders, customers and the market.""

1512,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 02:16PM ET</span>",How big unions smooth the way for Amazon worker protests,"By Nandita Bose and Krystal Hu
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Warehouse employees last month staged a walkout in Michigan to demand safer working conditions at their facility. So did workers in New York, Illinois and Minnesota. 
These and other Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) employees across the country are seizing on the coronavirus to demand the world's largest online retailer offer more paid sick time and temporarily shut warehouses with infections for deep cleaning.
Employees in at least 11 states this year have voiced their concerns and staged actions to highlight a variety of purported workplace deficiencies, allegations the company has denied. 
Supporting these Amazon workers are labor groups and unions eager to penetrate the Seattle-based behemoth after years of failed attempts to unionize its operations. 
Reuters spoke with 16 unions and labor groups targeting Amazon. They included established organizations such as the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the United Food & Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) and the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), as well as newer worker advocacy groups like Warehouse Workers for Justice and Athena, a coalition of labor and social justice groups that have criticized Amazon's business practices. 
Most unions acknowledged their long odds at organizing Amazon using traditional tactics such as holding meetings and gauging interest. Legal hurdles to unionizing the company's workplaces and mounting elections are steep. For now, many groups said, they are showing workers how to harness public opinion to shame Amazon into granting concessions. 
The strategy proved effective in the national ""Fight for $15"" campaign to raise the minimum wage. Labor organizations in recent years helped retail and fast-food workers stage highly publicized protests and social media campaigns to draw attention to their modest pay at a time when the economy was booming. 
Cities and states including Seattle, San Francisco, California, Arkansas and Missouri raised their minimum wages as did some large U.S. employers, including Amazon, which attributed its pay hikes to a tight labor market as well as pressure from lawmakers and labor groups. 
In labor's latest efforts targeting Amazon, organizations are helping workers create online petitions, connect with elected officials, contact media and file labor complaints with the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The initiative puts public pressure on Amazon to respond, several groups said, while laying the groundwork for unions to recruit card-carrying members in the future. 
""We expect that there will be more push for unionization when we get to the other side of this,"" said Stuart Applebaum, president of RWDSU. 
Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said Amazon already offers what these groups are requesting: $15 per hour or more to start, health benefits and opportunities for career growth. 
""We encourage anyone interested in the facts to compare our overall pay and benefits, as well as our speed in managing this crisis, to other retailers and major employers across the country,"" she said. 
Central to the organizing effort, union officials said, is fear among some frontline Amazon workers over the spread of coronavirus in the company's warehouses. 
At least 800 workers in Amazon's 519 U.S. distribution facilities have tested positive for COVID-19, based on internal company figures compiled by Jana Jumpp, an Amazon warehouse employee in Indiana, who shared the numbers with Reuters. Amazon sends text messages and automated calls to employees alerting them to positive cases in their facilities. Jumpp aggregates cases mentioned in messages sent to her by Amazon workers around the country. 
Jumpp said the informal process she has developed likely misses cases. She and other employees said Amazon does not share a running tally of cases at each facility or provide a nationwide count. 
""We have no idea how many people are actually sick, not tested or out on quarantine,"" Jumpp said on a recent media call organized by Athena, the labor coalition. 
At least six Amazon workers have died of COVID-19, which the company confirmed publicly after each incident. 
Amazon's Lighty would not disclose to Reuters the total number of Amazon employees who have tested positive for coronavirus in the United States. She said the company's efforts to quarantine infected workers are helping to slow the spread, and rates of infection ""are at or below the communities we're operating in at almost all of our facilities."" Lighty did not provide data to support that claim. 
A majority of Amazon employees are showing up at work and the company ""objects to the irresponsible actions of labor groups and others in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon,"" she said. 
Lighty said employee health and safety is the company's top priority. Amazon will spend more than $800 million in the first half of the year on COVID-19 safety measures, she said. 
Amazon over the past decade has eviscerated brick-and-mortar retail competitors, some of them unionized, while successfully fending off several attempts by its own employees to organize. With shutdowns now battering Main Street, Amazon is poised to emerge from the COVID-19 crisis stronger than ever. 
The company reported record first-quarter sales of $75.5 billion, up 26% from the same period a year ago, as customers sheltering in place have relied on its services and its stock price has risen 35% since the start of the year. 
Amazon had nearly 600,000 U.S. employees in 2019, according to its latest annual report, making it one of the largest employers in the country. 
In 2019, 10.3% of U.S. workers were union members, down from 20.1% in 1983, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Over 33 million U.S. workers have filed for unemployment benefits in recent weeks, strengthening the hand of employers at a time of mass unemployment. Still, some labor experts said coronavirus presents unions with their best shot in decades to make inroads at Amazon.
""Justice issues and safety at work tend to be the most powerful arguments in organizing,"" said Alex Colvin, a labor relations professor at Cornell University. ""They're the strongest reason for workers to want representation.""
He said unions have resorted to public relations as a tool to pressure companies as worker protections such as ""collective bargaining and employment rights enforcement have weakened.""
FIGHTING UNIONS 
Amazon has resisted unionization within its workforce since its founding in 1994. It defeated unionizing efforts in Seattle in 2000 and in Delaware in 2014 by a wide margin. 
In recent weeks it has fired at least four workers in three states who had publicly criticized the company and were involved in organizing. 
Lighty said Amazon has ""zero tolerance"" for retaliation. These workers were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions or safety, but for violating policies such as physical distancing, she said. 
Among those sacked was Emily Cunningham, a Seattle-based activist with Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, who gained prominence for pushing the company to do more to fight global warming. She had recently circulated a petition calling for measures such as improved sick leave and urged all employees to agree on a day in April to call in sick to protest warehouse working conditions. 
""There is a lot of frustration on how Amazon is handling the issue of workplace safety,"" Cunningham said. She said she has been in touch with the AFL-CIO about the sickout, and a local affiliate of the union called MLK Labor has offered support to continue the fight on working conditions. MLK Labor confirmed it is working with employees that Amazon fired in Seattle.
The AFL-CIO's secretary treasurer, Elizabeth Shuler, said the union is using the pandemic to galvanize Amazon workers at company headquarters and enlist support from elected officials. Amazon had over 53,000 employees in Seattle in 2019. 
""Amazon's backyard is Seattle, and that's a major focus for us in terms of how to take the energy, the courage, the activism that we are already seeing there and build that into a real movement,"" she said. 
Amazon's Lighty said the company has listened to complaints and implemented over 150 measures to keep workers safe. 
The company is also running television advertisements thanking warehouse workers. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in April showed up at a Texas distribution center and met workers to show his support. 
NEW APPROACH 
But a steady rise in the number of infections at warehouses has spurred more protests. 
Amazon worker Mario Crippen led an April 1 walkout at a Michigan warehouse to protest what he said was a lack of transparency from the company about the number of infections. He said about 40 workers participated in that action at the facility in Romulus, about 24 miles southwest of Detroit. 
Amazon disputed that figure, saying fewer than 15 people participated. 
Helping Crippen was labor nonprofit United for Respect, which coached him on how to gain media attention without getting fired and use social media to gather more supporters. The group also offered legal help from attorneys if he was terminated. 
Crippen, 26, whose job is to stow products at the warehouse, told Reuters he felt as if ""somebody had my back."" He said at least 25 workers at the Romulus warehouse have tested positive, according to figures compiled by employees at the site. Crippen said some workers want the facility shut down for cleaning, and plan to continue protesting working conditions while exploring the idea of working closely with labor groups and unions in the future. 
Amazon spokeswoman Lighty did not comment about the Romulus protest, the number of cases at the site or the company's decision to not shut down the facility. She said Amazon's decision to handle the closure of a building for deep cleaning depends on several factors, including consulting with health authorities and medical experts. 
A spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Labor said the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MIOSHA), received employee complaints about the Romulus site and sent a letter to Amazon listing steps the company ""could take to correct the hazards."" She and MIOSHA would not provide more information. 
Lighty did not comment on the details in the letter. 
Some labor organizers are instructing workers on how to file such safety complaints. They are also using Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live, Instagram posts, Telegram chats and WhatsApp messages to share other tactics with Amazon employees. 
At Whole Foods, an upscale supermarket chain owned by Amazon, several current and former employees have been using Telegram to rally coworkers across the country to agitate for expanded paid sick leave and temporary shutdown of stores with confirmed COVID-19 cases. 
""First step is to ask what will you do if our store is tested positive? Then form a committee. Plan actions. Document. Call the government,"" wrote one of the workers, who confirmed sending the message and discussed the strategy with Reuters on condition of anonymity. The employee said the group has doubled to 400 members since the pandemic began. Reuters could not independently confirm the growth in membership. 
This worker and fellow organizers are collaborating with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, and are working under the name ""Whole Worker's National Organizing Committee."" 
UFCW President Marc Perrone said the union is currently not focusing on the traditional playbook of getting employees to sign cards and become members. 

""Right now ...it is about showing workers value and what we can do for them,"" he said.

1513,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>","Americans splurge at Walmart, Target as stimulus checks kick in","By Aishwarya Venugopal
(Reuters) - The Trump Administration's coronavirus relief payment provided a fillip to sales of major retailers in April as millions of Americans used the money to buy everything from video games to sewing machines even as the country struggles with record job losses.
Walmart (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT) noted in their earnings call this week that quarterly comparable sales, which rose about 10%, got a major boost from increased demand for non-essentials at the end of last month.
""Call it relief spending, as it was heavily influenced by stimulus dollars,"" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said on Tuesday, citing a jump in sales of clothing, televisions, video games, sporting goods and toys.
The U.S. government doled out relief checks of $1,200 in late April to help tens of millions of households cover essentials and cope with the financial distress brought on by the coronavirus pandemic as job losses reached 20 million.
However, as lockdown restrictions were eased, Americans moved away from stockpiling staples and instead splurged on discretionary big-ticket items, helping boost margins for retailers.
The shift also helped specialty retailers such as  Best Buy  (N:BBY) and  Advance Auto Parts  Inc (N:AAP).
""We did see an increase on the week of the stimulus, but the week after the stimulus was better ... And then two weeks after was better than one week after. So we are seeing that sequential improvement,"" Advance Auto Chief Executive Tom Greco said.
Target CEO Brian Cornell said the company saw an increase in online and store traffic, both tied to the extra cash, but cautioned that the bump could be short-lived.

Edward Jones analyst Brain Yarbrough concurred, saying, ""I wouldn't expect the trends you've seen in late April and potentially in the beginning of May to continue. That wouldn't be realistic.""

Down more than 48% this year when measured in dollars, Brazilian stocks will benefit from growing appetite for risky assets and a recovery in commodities prices during the second half of 2020, strategists led by Kamakshya Trivedi wrote in a report dated May 20.
“Brazilian equities are an ideal bounceback candidate,” the strategists said. They recommended investors go long the benchmark Ibovespa index with a target of 90,000 points, or about 9% above current levels.
Investors have fled from Brazilian stocks and its currency this year as the Covid-19 pandemic battered the economy and worsened the nation’s already-fragile fiscal outlook. Assets have been further undermined by political turbulence and a lack of confidence in President Jair Bolsonaro as he downplays the coronavirus threat even as Brazil becomes the world’s hotspot for new infections.
To be sure, a rally to 90,000 would still leave the Ibovespa about 22% below where it was at the end of last year.

1516,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>","Clarida Says Economy May Need More Fiscal, Monetary Support","(Bloomberg) -- U.S policy makers may need to provide the battered economy with additional support beyond the unprecedented actions they’ve already taken, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said on Thursday.
“Depending on the course the virus takes and the depth and duration of the downturn it causes, additional support from both monetary and fiscal policies may be called for,” he said in the text of a speech to be delivered via webcast to New York Association for Business Economics.
While pledging that the Fed will continue to act aggressively to counteract the economic blow from the coronavirus crisis, Clarida also stressed the limit of central bank’s support -- it can only lend out money, not spend it -- and said budgetary action was essential.
“Direct fiscal support can make a critical difference, not just in helping families and businesses stay afloat in a time of need, but also in sustaining the productive capacity of the economy after we emerge from this downturn,” he said.
Congressional Debate
Clarida’s comments echo those made over the past week by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and come ahead of expected negotiations between Republican and Democratic lawmakers and the White House over another fiscal package. Lawmakers have already passed nearly $3 trillion of measures to cushion the economy from what Clarida called the “severe” blow from the coronavirus crisis.
The Fed vice chairman said he expects the economy to begin to pick up and unemployment to start to fall in the second half of the year, though he added it will take some time for the economy to fully recover. He also cautioned that the outlook remained highly uncertain and subject to the course of the virus.
The jobless rate more than tripled in April to 14.7% as employers cut an unprecedented 20.5 million jobs. A further rise is expected this month.
Clarida called the virus crisis a “disinflationary shock” and suggested that the drag on prices may last for a while.
“While the COVID-19 shock is disrupting both aggregate demand and supply, the net effect, I believe, will be for aggregate demand to decline relative to aggregate supply, both in the near term and over the medium term,” he said.

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) will continue to limit bookings on its flights through at least July to give passengers space between seats, CEO Gary Kelly told shareholders on Thursday, mirroring a plan by competitor Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL).
Social distancing on planes has become a topic of debate as airlines weigh safety measures to restore confidence in air travel that has collapsed during the coronavirus pandemic.
""You won't see full flights on Southwest at least through the end of July, and if we do have more demand for that flight, we'll add additional flights to meet demand,"" Kelly said at its annual shareholders' meeting, which was held virtually.
Delta also plans to continue limiting the number of passengers on each flight through at least July, people told Reuters this week.
Airlines have been operating about 90% fewer flights than normal but are gradually adding flights back to their schedules as demand begins picking up.
Southwest said on Tuesday it recorded positive bookings on a net basis so far this month as passenger reservations outpaced trip cancellations, helping the company slow its cash burn rate. 
The company currently has $13 billion cash in the bank that will carry it through at least 20 months at current blast rates, Kelly said, and likely many more months than that ""because I do think things continue to improve.""

Southwest's June capacity will be roughly half its schedule a year ago - an improvement from a 60% to 70% reduction in May.

The legislation, which requires companies to certify that they are not under the control of a foreign government, was approved by the Senate by unanimous consent on Wednesday.
“No vote is yet scheduled in the House, but we believe there will be a significant push for the legislation to be taken up in the coming weeks, and we believe it is only a matter of time before this bill (or something similar) is signed into law,” Raymond James policy analyst Ed Mills wrote in a note to clients.
Even if the bill is eventually approved, actual delisting requirements may kick in several years from now, experts said. But any move could still prompt retaliation from China, especially given the current fraught relationship between the two countries in the midst of drawn out trade negotiations and the Covid-19 outbreak.
“The optics of even holding this vote are likely to trigger backlash from China and further rhetoric around releasing the Unreliable Entity List, restricting rare earth minerals, boycotts and the like,” Veda Partners’ director of economic policy Henrietta Treyz said.
The bill comes at a critical time, analysts noted, when both Republicans and Democrats want to appear tough on China, earning the legislation strong bipartisan support.
Some of the most important Chinese companies that might come under the bill include  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., PetroChina Co. Ltd., Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com Inc. According to Mills at Raymond James, affected companies may list on non-U.S. stock exchanges, which would limit the bill’s reach.
Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg pointed out that although Democrats want to be seen as tough on China, they may not want to let President Donald Trump change the subject from the pandemic by celebrating the enactment of this bill.
“For now, we believe the desire to keep Trump from celebrating is the priority but this is a close call,” the analyst said.

1521,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>","U.S. banking regulator Otting to exit, his deputy to serve as acting chief","By Pete Schroeder and Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Joseph Otting, the head of a top U.S. banking regulator and former CEO of California's OneWest Bank (N:CIT), is stepping down from his government post after two and a half years, he announced on Thursday.
Brian Brooks, Otting's top deputy at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees lenders including  Wells Fargo  and Citibank, will lead the agency as acting head. 
Brooks, who joined the agency in April as chief operating officer, previously worked with Otting at OneWest and has also held senior posts at housing finance giant Fannie Mae and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. 
A close associate of U.S. Treasury Department Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who helped created OneWest, Otting was appointed by the Trump administration in 2017 to cut red tape. 
Otting, who had been known to refer to the banks he oversaw as ""customers,"" simplified and eased some rules for large national banks and slashed how much the regulator charged lenders to cover the costs of monitoring them.
He said in a statement he was ""extremely proud"" of the OCC's efforts to ""eliminate unnecessary regulatory burden and operate the agency in a more effective and efficient manner.""
That frequently made him a target of progressives, in particular bank critic Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who frequently sparred with Otting at congressional hearings.
But Otting surprised industry executives by taking a tough line on Wells Fargo (N:WFC) as it struggled to recover from multiple product mis-selling scandals. In January, the OCC levied an unprecedented $58 million penalty on eight of its former executives.

In his final act as a regulator, Otting pushed through a rewrite of rules which require banks to lend to lower-income communities, with an eye toward making it easier for lenders to achieve a passing grade - a measure loudly criticized by Democrats and consumer advocacy groups.

1522,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>",America’s Online Shopping Revolution Will Outlast the Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. retailers are reporting a surge in online sales in the first quarter of 2020, when the country’s virus-driven lockdown began. Economists reckon the shift in consumer habits may prove to be lasting.
 Target  Corp. (NYSE:TGT) said yesterday that its digital sales jumped more than 140% from the same period of 2019. Earlier in the week, retailers from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. to  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD). and Lowe’s Companies Inc. had reported increases in the range of 70% to 80%.
The pandemic has shut down business across the country, while health concerns and stay-at-home orders led many buyers to go online even for items that remain available in-store, such as groceries. The result: A sudden acceleration in America’s decades-long drift toward remote shopping.
“We’re seeing a massive rotation in consumer behavior toward e-commerce and home delivery,” said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics. “The shift has been pretty dramatic.”
Whether it’s also durable will become clear as the economy reopens.
“It will be difficult to gauge how the landscape might evolve until all stores are open again and consumers have a chance to, if they choose, go back to their old ways,” said Stephen Stanley at Amherst Pierpont Securities.
Many local authorities are reluctant to push ahead too fast with the removal of restrictions, while uncertainty about the health risks remains high. And even where there’s a partial re-opening, there are often new rules -- like limits on the number of shoppers in stores, or requirements for them to wear face-masks -- that may deter some shoppers.
Target’s customers began returning to the physical stores in mid-April, Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell said in an earnings call on Wednsday. Even so, he said, “our digital growth continued at unprecedented rates, up 200% to 300% above last year.”
Walmart Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said the company’s online pickup and delivery business had brought in new customers -- notably including some older Americans who may not have done much online shopping before.
“We will see some bounce-back as lockdowns ease, but a large part of the shift to online shopping will be permanent,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities. And that will accelerate the consolidation of brick-and-mortar retailers, he said. “We are likely to see a substantial number of stores close.”

A Massachusetts official said in an email that the state had 115,952 initial claims last week under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, not the 1,184,792 shown in the U.S. Labor Department’s report earlier Thursday. That means the 2.23 million reported figure for nationwide PUA claims was likely about half that number in reality.
Those figures are separate from the principal number tallying initial claims under regular state programs, which was reported as a seasonally adjusted 2.44 million last week.

1528,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",TJX says sales recovering after coronavirus slump,"(Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc (N:TJX) said it was seeing very strong sales at its stores reopened post-coronavirus lockdowns, offering hope of a swift recovery after a huge quarterly loss due to closures and a resulting decline in sales, sending its shares up 6% on Thursday. 
The discount chain is seen as among the better positioned retailers as its value-priced goods are attractive to shoppers looking to save money in the face of increased uncertainty about jobs and household finances. 
""Although it's still early and the retail environment remains uncertain, we have been encouraged with the very strong sales we have seen with our initial reopenings,"" Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said. 
""We believe this very strong start speaks to our compelling value proposition and the appeal of our treasure-hunt shopping experience, as well as pent-up demand."" 
TJX, the parent of Marmaxx stores, said it has reopened more than 1,600 of its about 4,500 stores worldwide.
MKM Partners analyst Roxanne Meyer said TJX's sales update was a sharp contrast to what other mall-based retailers have said. 
""We think TJX traffic disproportionately benefits from its off-mall, high traffic locations as well as its cult-like customer following."" 
In contrast, department store chains, including J.C Penney (N:JCP) and Neiman Marcus, that have been through recessions and economic uncertainties in the past were forced to seek bankruptcy protection as losses mount and mall traffic declines. 
TJX in March halted both online and offline operations to prevent its employees from catching COVID-19. 
It said there will be no dividend for the first quarter and also does not expect to pay any in the current quarter.

For the quarter ended May 2, net sales fell 52.5% to $4.41 billion. Net loss came in at $887.5 million, or 74 cents per share.

1530,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",Macy's warns of up to $1 billion quarterly loss due to lockdowns,"(Reuters) - Macy's Inc (N:M) said on Thursday it could rack up operating losses of up to $1.11 billion in the first quarter, as the department store operator was forced to shut stores due to lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus.
The health crisis has forced brick-and-mortar retailers to tap credit lines, lay off employees and suspend dividends and buybacks in a bid to stay afloat amid store closures.
Just this month, several retailers, including J Crew, J.C. Penney and luxury store chain Neiman Marcus Group filed for bankruptcy after failing to cope with market uncertainties and mounting debt.
Macy's, which shut all of its 775 stores on March 18 to curb the spread of the coronavirus, hired investment bank  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ) to explore options for bolstering its finances, Reuters reported last month.
It started reopening stores on a state-by-state basis on May 4 and, as of this week, approximately 190 Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores have reopened fully.
The company expects most stores to reopen by late June, including its flagship store in Manhattan.
""We expect business to recover gradually,"" Macy's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said.
Despite online sales bringing some respite to retailers, Gennette said it could not offset the losses relating to store closures. Offering services, including curbside pickup where allowed, has helped the retailer boost sales.
From suits to dresses, apparel sales across the board have been ""soft,"" Gennette said on a call with investors.
The company said it recorded inventory writedowns of about $300 million at the end of the first quarter.
Gennette identified fine jewelry, kids and home as categories that have performed better than others during the pandemic. 
Moving forward, Macy's will look to expand its packaged food, home office and cooking and baking offerings, he said. 
Macy's, the largest U.S. department store operator by sales, expects to post an operating loss of between $905 million and $1.11 billion. It forecast first-quarter sales in the range of $3 billion to $3.03 billion, down from $5.50 billion a year earlier.
The loss excludes potential estimated pretax non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges for the quarter.
Macy's had earlier this month said it would report its first-quarter earnings on July 1 as significant business disruptions due to the pandemic had led to delays in preparing its financial statement.
Shares of the company were down 1.38% at $5.00 in premarket trading.

1532,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 09:01AM ET</span>",Gap rushes in more robots to warehouses to solve virus disruption,"By Jeffrey Dastin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - U.S. apparel chain Gap Inc (N:GPS) is speeding up its rollout of warehouse robots for assembling online orders so it can limit human contact during the coronavirus pandemic, the company told Reuters.
Gap reached a deal early this year to more than triple the number of item-picking robots it uses to 106 by the fall. Then the pandemic struck North America, forcing the company to close all its stores in the region, including those of Banana Republic, Old Navy and other brands. Meanwhile, its warehouses faced more web orders and fewer staff to fulfill them because of social distancing rules Gap had put in place.
""We could not get as many people in our distribution centers safely,"" said Kevin Kuntz, Gap's senior vice president of global logistics fulfillment. So he called up Kindred AI, the vendor that sells the machines, to ask: ""Can you get them here earlier?""
Sourcing parts in time for the eight-foot-tall robotic stations was not simple or cheap, said Kindred's Chief Operating Officer Marin Tchakarov. But the venture-backed startup was able to deploy 10 of them to Gap's warehouse near Nashville, Tennessee and 20 near Columbus, Ohio, with plans to finish the rollout to four of Gap's five U.S. facilities by July, months ahead of schedule, he said.
Each machine handles work typically performed by four people, Kuntz said. Neither the deal to triple the number of robots, nor the expedited installations, have been previously reported.
The news illustrates how the pandemic may speed up automation in the retail industry. Companies including Gap and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) have long used such systems for a range of tasks, like moving items across warehouse floors. Various new technologies are capable of supplanting some cashier, box packing and item picking roles that employ millions of U.S. workers, and the pandemic is giving vendors a chance to make their case.
The firm RightHand Robotics, for instance, has helped its customer Walmart Inc (N:WMT) manage more online orders through greater use of its picking machines that had been deployed at several of the chain's facilities, a person familiar with the matter said. Walmart did not answer requests for comment.
Vince Martinelli, RightHand's head of product and marketing, declined comment on the deployment but said as a general matter, ""If you're going to have limited people in the building, the last thing you want them to do is a simple task that can be automated.""
Amazon is also relying more in the pandemic on automation for sorting items that warehouse workers have unpacked, sparing staff from having to walk by each other frequently as the more manual process once required, the company said. It is looking to roll out the technology more widely in its buildings.
Kindred, RightHand and robotics firm Berkshire Grey told Reuters they are seeing a rise in inquiries from prospective retail clients, though travel restrictions and the need to limit human contact make new installations a challenge.
The interest is no surprise: researchers from the Brookings Institution have said spurts of automation often follow economic shocks, a phenomenon they said could be replayed as retailers' sales plunge.
""At these moments, employers shed less-skilled workers and replace them with technology and higher-skilled workers, which increases labor productivity as a recession tapers off,"" the think tank's March report said.
'THEY NEVER TAKE BREAKS'
Pressure to make distribution networks more efficient is likely to increase for retailers because of their financial woes during the pandemic.
Gap last month said it faced a cash shortage, prompting it to borrow $2.25 billion. Three-quarters of its revenue its last fiscal year came from over 3,300 physical stores, most of which it has closed for weeks.
While Gap has kept shops in China in business and has started the re-opening of 800 others this month, its e-commerce operation has been a lifeline for sales. 
Gap, based in San Francisco, did not disclose the financial terms of its deal with Kindred, or its base pay for staff. The company said it has around 6,500 warehouse employees, who are receiving higher wages because of the health crisis. It is limiting numbers in facilities because of U.S. health guidance.
Kindred's ""SORT"" machines help Gap assemble multi-item purchases from customers.
Goods from various online checkout carts fall down a chute and into a large basin that's part of one of the machines. A robotic arm above then picks each unit through suction and a physical grip, scans its bar code and places it in a bin in an adjacent cubby. Once all the items in a customer's order are in, a worker puts the bin on a conveyer for packing and delivery.
Kindred, with headquarters in San Francisco, is one of several startups selling artificially intelligent robots that aim to grasp almost any item quickly and without breakage. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. retail workers perform this task, and Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has said the tech is years away from taking over that work. Still, retailers can use robots to pick narrower sets of products.
Kindred's Tchakarov said, ""Our robotics systems, they never get tired. They never take breaks.""
Kindred and Gap say they aim for the technology to complement workers, not replace them. At its warehouses, Gap is still scouting for new hires - and potentially new machines.

""Should we do even more?"" Kuntz asked. ""How quickly can a Kindred build those machines?""

1533,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2020 08:27AM ET</span>",Hertz Runs Into Cash Crunch After Years of Management Tumult,"(Bloomberg) --
Less than three months ago,  Hertz Global Holdings  (NYSE:HTZ) Inc. executives were touting a solid fourth-quarter performance and saying they’re entering 2020 in a strong position.
Today, they’re managing a crisis that has the company on the brink of bankruptcy, saddled with almost $21 billion of debt and a bloated fleet of vehicles that are depreciating in value as the Covid-19 crisis has ground much of the economy to a virtual standstill.
For Hertz, the No. 2 U.S. car renter, travel restrictions and shutdowns have brought about comeuppance for years of management missteps. This week, Paul Stone, who had been head of North American car-rental operations, became the company’s fifth chief executive officer since 2014.
With cash drying up and the price of used cars plummeting, Hertz has skipped vehicle lease payments and has until May 22 to work out an agreement with lenders and bondholders. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the company is seeking another 60-day forbearance to negotiate terms, citing a person familiar with the talks. Representative for Hertz didn’t immediately reply to Bloomberg’s request for comment.
While all travel-related companies have been hurt by the pandemic, a big part of what’s weighing on Hertz is its strategy of owning or leasing a large portion of its fleet outright instead of acquiring them through buyback agreements with manufacturers. Hertz owns about 89% of its U.S. fleet, compared with 66% at competitor  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group Inc., according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Hamzah Mazari.
The U.S. car-rental industry is dominated by closely held Enterprise Holdings Inc., Hertz and Avis. They typically respond to a drop in demand by selling cars from their fleets into the used market and slowing new-car purchases. So when prices at used-car auctions tumbled due to the virus outbreak, Hertz took a much worse hit than Avis, Mazari said.
The fleet-ownership structure issue is one of many maladies that have been festering for years, according to analysts. Hertz also has had trouble navigating volatile used-car prices and the advent of ride-hailing. It’s had too big of a fleet and an outsize focus on gaining market share.
“It is incredible to me how their fortunes changed so quickly,” said Robert Rostan, the chief financial officer of Training the Street, which offers technical training to Wall Street firms, business schools, startups and private equity firms. “Even though they just finished a record year and things were looking fine, they were still operating on a razor-thin cushion of liquidity.”
As of the end of first quarter, Hertz had just over $1 billion in cash and equivalents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
A large part of Hertz’s current plight can also be traced to its $2.6 billion acquisition of Dollar Thrifty in 2012, under the leadership of then-CEO Mark Frissora. According to Millman Research Associates analyst Michael Millman, not only did Hertz pay too much, it also botched the process of integrating the two brands and failed to reap the benefits of the pricing power that such a consolidation typically brings.
Hertz “did very little with Dollar Thrifty, so it just sort of sat there,” Millman said in an interview.
At the same time, the company often sacrificed price for market share, which eventually hurt profitability. Hertz’s significant debt load also has stayed stubbornly high -- it dipped a bit in 2016 after the company’s spinoff of equipment-rental company Herc Holdings (NYSE:HRI) Inc., then quickly rose again.
“Hertz has had too much leverage for years, even with proceeds from the Herc Rentals’ spin,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joel Levington said. The company had total debt of $20.6 billion as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its market valuation now stands at around $425 million.
The struggles have long frustrated investors, including Hertz’s biggest stakeholder, Carl Icahn. His activism contributed to Frissora’s ouster in 2014 following disappointing earnings and accounting issues. The baton passed to an interim replacement and then to John Tague, who left in late 2016 after his efforts to raise prices led to market share losses. He was followed by Kathryn Marinello, who resigned May 16.
Shares of Hertz are trading near a record low, having plunged more than 80% this year. Avis has fared slightly better, dropping about 50%. The S&P 500 Index is down about 8%.
Hertz’s problems arguably originated in the 2013 as the company chased market share while failing to update its technology in keeping with the rest of the industry, Mazari of Jefferies said. It also didn’t refresh its fleet fast enough.
The company’s long-running turnaround efforts finally started showing some results late last year and in early 2020. But the coronavirus shutdowns led to an almost overnight disappearance of demand for rental cars.
Despite that, Avis has so far weathered the shock much better than Hertz, thanks to its business mix and a slightly better debt situation, according to Mazari.
“Avis was a much cleaner company to begin with,” he said. “They always maintained supply-demand balance pretty tightly, they were always rational with pricing and they always invested in the systems to be a better operator.”

1534,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Baidu considers leaving the Nasdaq to boost its valuation - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Zhang Yan
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc (O:BIDU) is considering delisting from the U.S. Nasdaq and moving to an exchange closer to home to boost its valuation amid rising tension between the United States and China over investments, three sources said.
Baidu, one of China's earliest U.S. listings, is reaching out to some trusted advisers to see how it could best be done if it were to proceed, including looking at issues around funding and any regulatory reaction, the sources told Reuters. 
The discussions are at an early stage and are subject to change, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the matter is not public.
Baidu declined to comment. 
The company pointed to comments by co-founder and Chief Executive Robin Li who told the state-controlled China Daily on Thursday that Baidu was paying close attention to the tighter U.S. scrutiny of Chinese companies listed in the country.
""For a good company, there are many choices of destinations for listing, not limited to the U.S.,"" he told the newspaper. 
The sources said Baidu believed it was undervalued on the Nasdaq exchange in New York.
Baidu's shares have fallen more than 60% since their peak in May 2018 while the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index (HXC), which tracks Chinese firms listed on the U.S. exchange, has lost less than 10% over the same period.
Baidu's market capitalization of $29.59 billion as of Wednesday's close is only 5% of the market value of  Alibaba , which has shares listed in Hong Kong (HK:9988) and American Depository Shares listed in New York (N:BABA).
Baidu, Ctrip (O:TCOM) and NetEase Inc (O:NTES) have all held preliminary talks with Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HK:0388) about a possible secondary listing to follow Alibaba in establishing an investor base closer to China, Reuters reported in January.
U.S. PRESSURE
The latest move by Baidu also comes as U.S.-listed Chinese companies face increased pressure amid heightened tensions between the world's two biggest economies. 
The U.S. senate passed a bill on Wednesday that could stop some Chinese companies listing on U.S. exchanges unless they follow standards for U.S. audits and regulations.
The move is seen as an escalation of a long-running dispute between Washington and Beijing about giving U.S. regulators access to Chinese audits. 
Last week, a board overseeing the Thrift Saving Plan, a retirement fund for U.S. federal employees and members of the military, indefinitely delayed plans to invest in some Chinese companies following pressure from the White House. 
At home, Baidu has been struggling with a slowing economy and rising competition from domestic players such as ByteDance, the owner of popular video-sharing app TikTok. Last year, ByteDance launched a search engine in China, entering a sector traditionally dominated by Baidu.
Beijing-based Baidu posted a 7% drop in first-quarter revenue this year. While its sales were better than analysts had expected, it was the biggest year-on-year drop since the company went public in 2005. 

Baidu generates the majority of its revenue from online marketing services, which include searches, news feeds and video apps.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>",COVID-era junk bond deals begin to go sour,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Companies hard-hit by the pandemic rushed to raise debt last month, encouraged by the Federal Reserve's intervention to support the credit market. But for some of the riskier names, those bond offerings have quickly curdled. 
Since March 24, the day after the Fed announced its unprecedented stimulus programs, 23 companies have borrowed money in the public market at a rate of 9% or higher, according to data from Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory and from Refinitiv Eikon and MarketAxess. 
Of those 23, new bonds from pharmaceutical company  Mallinckrodt  (N:MNK), movie theater chain AMC Entertainment (N:AMC) and billboard giant Clear Channel Outdoor (N:CCO) are trading around 80 cents on the dollar, a 20 point fall in the two months since they were issued, the data showed. 
""Even with how quickly things are changing in this economy, to have a deal go sour in just a few weeks is shocking. Sometimes the huge coupon is a siren song,"" said Graff. 
""I definitely think as the market wakes up to the reality that the Fed isn't going to prevent defaults, and that there will be winners and losers, the junk bond market could get more challenging.""
Multiple investors including Graff said that these companies would be unlikely to qualify for the Fed's primary-market bond buying program, which is limited to investment-grade companies and those recently downgraded for investment grade to the first tier of junk. 
The three companies did not respond to a request for comment about whether they would qualify for Fed funds. AMC said in a recent filing that it intended to seek potential government benefits such as loans. 
In March, the Fed announced a primary market facility to buy new high-grade corporate bonds and a secondary market facility to buy shares in exchange-traded funds. Both were later expanded to include some speculative debt. Its primary facility can buy bonds of companies that have a maturity of five years or less and are rated at least BBB-/Baa3 as of March 22, or if downgraded, must be at least BB-/Ba3.
Mallinckrodt, Clear Channel and AMC are rated deep into junk territory: AMC is rated in the triple-C category, one notch above default, by both S&P and Moody's (NYSE:MCO); Mallinckrodt is also triple-C-rated by S&P, though Moody's has withdrawn the rating; and Clear Channel is rated B- by S&P and B3 by Moody's, a step above triple-C. 
The Fed's announcements boosted prices and issuance in both the investment-grade and junk sectors. Junk-bond spreads - the premium investors demand to hold the riskier debt over safer Treasuries - widened about 750 basis points between February and March, using the ICE/BofA high yield index (MERH0A0). The spread has since narrowed by about 350 basis points since peaking on March 23. 
Still, a split has become evident between companies eligible for Fed bailouts - high-grade names - and speculative-grade companies unlikely to garner direct support. 
""There has been really significant differentiation largely because of these Fed programs,"" said Erin Browne, managing director and portfolio manager at PIMCO. 
Companies in the most distressed sectors have been able to borrow, but at a much higher cost than they previously had. 
While not all of the twenty-three 9%-coupon-plus issuers are junk rated - retailer Kohls (N:KSS) and cruise lines Carnival Corp (N:CCL) and  Royal Caribbean  (N:RCL) are on the precipice - they have all been priced like deeply speculative companies, with coupons as high as 13%. 

""I think buyers are assuming that the cash infusion from these debt deals will bridge the company to when the economy can reopen, and therefore the huge coupon is extremely attractive. But really if this one liquidity injection solved a company's problems, the coupon wouldn't be 9%, 10%, 12%,"" said Graff.

The electronics retailer was forced to shutter stores across the country for weeks to help contain the spread of the coronavirus, but outlets continued to provide curbside delivery for online sales that surged over 155% on a comparable basis in the United States.
The lockdowns fuelled demand for monitors, printers and other work-from-home equipment, as well as gaming-related products. 
Best Buy's overall revenue fell 6.3% to $8.56 billion in the first quarter ended May 2, but beat analysts' expectations of $8.16 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Quarterly same-store sales fell 5.3%. 
The company's net earnings fell to $159 million, or 61 cents per share, from $265 million, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Owners of $1.2 billion in debt issued by Etihad and other airlines it partly owned have given the struggling Abu Dhabi carrier an ultimatum to agree to a restructuring or potentially face legal action, two sources close to the situation said.
The move is the latest turn in the unravelling of Etihad's strategy to embark on global partnerships with airlines, the most high profile of which have since gone bankrupt.
A steering committee of debtholders, comprising largely local as well as international investment funds, submitted a proposal to Etihad about a month ago asking the carrier to agree to restructure the two bonds, due in September 2020 and June 2021, but have yet to receive a response, the sources said.
The proposal, which has not previously been reported, involves a maturity extension of the debt by up to three years but would require Etihad or its owner, the oil rich Abu Dhabi government, to guarantee the repayment of the underlying loans that were made to airlines partly owned by Etihad such as Air Serbia and Air Seychelles. 
Etihad issued the debt in 2015 and 2016 through an Amsterdam-based special purpose vehicle, EA Partners (EAP), which then distributed the money to Etihad and the other airlines.
The original deal envisaged each airline paying off its own portion of the debt, according to the debt documentation, a copy of which has been seen by Reuters.
Under the latest proposal, creditors would write off the portion of the debt owed by bankrupt carriers Air Berlin and Jet Airways, equivalent to $344 million, the sources said. 
Debt owed by Alitalia, the Italian carrier, would be included in the proposed refinancing because Etihad agreed to cover it under a private ""debt assumption agreement"" signed by the two airlines in 2016, the sources said.
If Etihad does not agree to the proposal, the bondholders via EAP will make a claim in ongoing bankruptcy proceedings involving Alitalia and Air Berlin. In this way, Etihad may be required to honour Alitalia's debt, the sources said.
Etihad declined to comment. EAP, Alitalia and the Abu Dhabi government did not respond to requests for comment.
Etihad has previously told EAP the debt assumption agreement is not enforceable against the company, according to an EAP stock exchange disclosure last month.
Even before the coronavirus froze most air traffic, the notes had lost more than half their value after three of the borrowing airlines went bankrupt.

For Etihad, which has piled up billions of dollars in losses since 2016, refinancing the debt could mean delaying repayments worth hundreds of millions of dollars while it deals with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis.

1540,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 21, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>",Specter of Negative Rates Is Putting Wall Street Bankers on Edge,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. banks have long looked with pity at overseas lenders coping with negative interest rates. Now, they’re grappling with the fear they may join the crowd.
Negative rates -- especially if they persist for many years -- reduce the spread banks make between lending and borrowing because they cannot pass the negative rate onto most depositors. Coupled with surging defaults due to an economic downturn, they can sap profits out of the banking system even if they create an initial jump in lending. That toxic combination has crippled Europe’s banks in the last six years, a dreaded position their U.S. peers would like to avoid.
“Initially, there’s a sugar rush when negative rates are introduced,” said Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies at London-based hedge fund Algebris Investments. “But ultimately, over time, you zombify the banks by lowering the velocity of money. Negative rates are a bad idea.”
Surging provisions for bad loans have already eaten into U.S. bank profits, with the top six firms seeing their first-quarter income decline by about 60%.
A quarter-point cut to zero for the upper bound of the Fed’s main policy rate could lower annual income by about $1 billion to $2 billion for each of the biggest banks, according to their latest quarterly filings. Further cuts below zero would add additional costs: paying the Federal Reserve for the $3 trillion excess reserves held at the central bank. At a hypothetical -1%, that would mean an annual charge of $30 billion for U.S. lenders, and roughly $10 billion of that would fall on the six biggest firms.
Fed policy makers have pushed back on traders who are pricing in the chance that they utilize a negative-rate policy. Earlier this month implied rates on Fed-funds futures showed traders saw likely odds of the central bank cutting rates below zero in January. Prices have stabilized since with futures no longer pricing in a negative Fed rate, yet options traders continue to purchase contracts that hedge against risk of that happening.
“Debt traders and the stock market overall are still pricing in the idea of negative rates being part of the arsenal of what the Fed may do,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and former trader at independent broker-dealer Incapital. “My mantra on the Fed, particularly this Fed, is don’t look at what they say. Look at what they do -- and look at what the market tells them to do.”
Bank executives constantly decry negative rates, arguing that the benefits to the economy are elusive while the harm to the banking system is significant. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has talked about “huge adverse consequences” of negative rates. European banks, which have suffered on their home turf with below-zero rates since 2014, have warned U.S. policy makers not to follow suit.
“Please don’t do this,” said Christiana Riley, head of  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) AG’s U.S. operations, at a conference in October. “It defies all logic.”
Still, President Donald Trump has consistently pressured the Fed to go negative, recently calling it a “gift” to the U.S. economy that should be accepted.
The biggest U.S. banks are still counting on Fed Chairman Jerome Powell not to heed those calls. In their latest quarterly filings, the scenarios that look at the potential impact of interest-rate changes on income all assumed a zero floor in the U.S. while considering lower rates worldwide.
Nevertheless, the banks are running internal models with negative rates, executives say. While they won’t reveal the numbers, executives acknowledge that the drop in income would grow incrementally as rates went further and further below zero. European lenders’ interest margins have declined by more than a quarter since the European Central Bank went negative, starting with -0.1% in 2014 and ending last year at -0.5%. Margins in Japan have dropped by about the same since 2016 after the Bank of Japan went to -0.1% and stayed there.
Algebris’ Gallo says U.S. banks have more pricing power in lending than their European counterparts because the banking system is dominated by a few large companies, which should cushion some of the blow from negative rates, at least initially. Most loan contracts in the U.S. have zero-rate floors even if they’re pegged to market interest rates, executives say. The largest U.S. lenders also earn quite a lot more than European peers from capital-markets businesses after having gained share in recent years.
Despite all the push-back, the Fed might move rates below zero if the right conditions unfold, according to JPMorgan analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. Those include the market ramping up its wagers again for negative rates and other leading central banks that haven’t gone negative yet switching tracks to do so, Panigirtzoglou said. In the short run, that would be a good move, though the benefits would erode after a year or two, he said.
“Negative Fed policy rates should help liquidity in the banking system as reserves should start propagating rather than staying idle at the big banks, which have been hoarding them,” said Panigirtzoglou, a London-based global market strategist. “For some smaller banks there are shortages of reserves and they’ve had to pay higher rates in the interbank market to get liquidity.”
While the Fed hasn’t yet delved into the sub-zero policy-rate zone, Treasury yields of the shortest of maturities have traded negative before and currently those with tenors out to two years have rates below the 0.25% top of the central bank’s target range. Two-year notes yield 0.17% and four-week Treasury bills are at just about 6 basis points. From mid-March to early April the four-week bill rate was mostly negative, in part due to shortages of the security.
“Market rates are so close to zero, negative rates are no longer a far-fetched scenario for U.S. banks,” said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods based in New York. “The longer they last, negative rates are a slow burn on net interest margins. Coupled with bad credit, that would permanently impair their business models just like it did European peers.”
Several years of negative rates would probably bring market valuations of U.S. banks to levels European and Japanese rivals have faced for a while, Kleinhanzl said.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks were on track for a lower open on Thursday, weighed down by simmering U.S.-China tensions and ongoing concerns over the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 18.25 points, or 0.6%, lower, and Nasdaq futures were down 42 points or 0.45%. The Dow futures contract was down 150 points, or 0.6%. 
The declines came after the three main indices posted their fourth gain in five sessions on Wednesday on the back of hopes for a faster economic rebound.
Market sentiment was dented after U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his criticism of Beijing’s handling of the pandemic, accusing them of spreading “pain and carnage” throughout the world.
Trump also appeared to single out Chinese President Xi Jinping personally, tweeting that “it all comes from the top” – adding to concerns over the future of the trade deal agreed last year between the world’s two largest economies.
Investors were looking ahead to weekly U.S. jobless claims figures, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with economists looking for a dip from last week, but a slight one as companies are still forced to shed jobs.
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to come in at 2.4 million, still high but well off the record 6.8 million seen at the end of March.
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting late Wednesday showed the central bank pledged to act as appropriate to support the economy until it is on track to recovery, a sentiment echoed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell in recent days.
In commodities markets, oil prices rose to the highest levels in two-and-a half months boosted by data from the Energy Information Administration showing that U.S. crude inventories fell by a larger-than-forecast 5 million barrels last week.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2% higher at $36.48 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract was also up 2% to $36.50.
Elsewhere, gold futures were down 0.9% to $1,736.05/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0984, little changed for the day."

1544,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>","While U.S. economy slides, heartland auto dealers cry out for more trucks","By Nick Carey
URBANDALE, Iowa (Reuters) - Jerry Bill is worried the novel coronavirus could hurt business at the Des Moines auto dealership he runs, but not because of a shortage of buyers for the big Ram pickups on his lot.
""Our biggest issue will be if we don't get more inventory,"" said Bill, general sales manager of Stew Hansen Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram, which sells around 2,700 new vehicles a year in Urbandale, a suburb of Iowa's capital Des Moines.
After a drop in sales in April when consumers stayed home, Bill expects pickup truck sales to end May similar to where they were a year earlier. 
And if demand remains strong, Bill said he will run out of popular models in June.  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) began slowly restarting Ram truck assembly lines on Monday after a two-month shutdown.
The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since the Great Recession of 2007-2009 because of lockdown measures aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Economists warn the second quarter will be much worse.
Still, far from the lockdowns of states like New York, Michigan or Ohio, dealerships like Stew Hansen have provided FCA and Detroit rivals General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) a rare bright spot: strong sales of pickup trucks in America's heartland. 
Overall U.S. sales of cars and light trucks crashed to the weakest pace in 50 years last month. But sales of big Detroit brand pickups, particularly in southern and western states less affected by the outbreak, significantly outperformed the market, industry executives and analysts said.
Pickup trucks are one of the most profitable automotive segments in the world. They account for a huge portion of the Detroit automakers' profits and formed a huge lure for  Peugeot  S.A. (PA:PEUP), which expects to merge with FCA by early 2021. 
The pressure is now on to boost pickup truck production and send vehicles to dealers in parts of the country with dwindling supplies.
That is particularly true for GM, which is running short of certain truck models after losing 40 days of production to a strike last fall. 
""If you don't have what someone wants, they can choose to go to another brand,"" said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. 
'EASIEST SWAP EVER'
Detroit automakers in March rolled out large discounts - such as interest-free loans for seven years - to keep vehicles rolling off dealer lots. 
""A lot of people that have two-year-old trucks can get into a new one for the same (monthly) payment or lower,"" said Noah Wolter, general manager of Charles Gabus Ford in Des Moines, who sold around 1,500 new vehicles last year. ""That's the easiest swap ever.""
Demand for large pickups ""is running incredibly strong,"" Ford U.S. sales and marketing chief Mark LaNeve said. Large pickups accounted for 21% of all U.S. vehicle sales in April, up from an average monthly proportion of 13% to 14%.
At Stew Hansen in Urbandale, Jerry Bill said thanks to discounts, customers have been able to get a $55,000 Ram truck for $44,000. That has encouraged some to switch out of SUVs or cars into newer truck models kitted out more like luxury vehicles than the workhorse trucks of old.
Mike Koval, interim head of the Ram brand at FCA, said inventory of certain versions of its Ram trucks were ""running a bit lean"" but the automaker was focused on boosting inventories in states where dealers have stayed open throughout the coronavirus outbreak.
Carl Moyer, owner of Karl Chevrolet in Ankeny, Iowa - the second-largest Chevrolet dealer in America with sales of 4,000 new vehicles a year - said he started off the crisis heavy on inventory. That cushion is gone, he said. 
Asked when he would start worrying about getting new trucks from GM to replenish his supply, Moyer said simply: ""Today.""

1545,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Traders Beware: U.S. taps new tools to find fraud in volatile commodities market,"By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the U.S. Department of Justice charged a handful of  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co traders in 2018 and 2019 with alleged commodities futures manipulation, it wasn't the first time the government had probed the bank's metals trading activities. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) investigated the same business as part of a similar probe of the silver market years earlier, but it was not able to build a case with the data it had at the time, according to U.S. court filings and a person with knowledge of the aborted probe. 
Since then, leaps in the agencies' data analysis capabilities have enabled them to detect and prosecute increasingly sophisticated forms of manipulation in the commodities futures markets which for decades have gone under-surveilled, according to ten officials and industry experts. 
The Justice Department fraud division is beefing up with the creation of a sub-unit specializing in combating commodities fraud overseen by Avi Perry, a trial attorney who has prosecuted high-profile cases involving trading powerhouse Tower Research Capital, Merrill Lynch Commodities Inc, and the ongoing JPMorgan probe, according to two sources.
The unit is also hiring a handful of additional trial attorneys, according to the sources and online job postings. A Justice Department spokesman said the agency intends to fill the positions ""promptly"". 
The unit is part of a broader Justice Department initiative to dramatically expand the scope of market manipulation the agency targets for criminal prosecutions, beyond traditional insider trading and futures manipulation into a range of asset classes, sources told Reuters.
The effort, if successful, raises the stakes for traders with potential jail-time, while banks, brokers and prop trading firms could face chunky fines and business curbs as the agency gets better at detecting potential misconduct across institutions.
The new-found expertise may also give the agencies an edge as they scrutinize extreme market volatility sparked by the novel coronavirus disruption, including last month's historic oil price crash. The CFTC is reviewing how the U.S. crude oil benchmark fell below $0 a barrel for the first time ever.
""There is just a wealth of information there, which is going to give us years and years of cases to come, I would expect,"" Robert Zink, chief of the Justice Department's fraud section, a unit of the agency's criminal division, said of the data in an interview.
The Justice Department's commodities crackdown has recently targeted ""spoofing,"" whereby futures traders falsely create the impression of strong demand or supply and then capitalize upon the market reaction.
Congress identified spoofing as market manipulation following the 2008 financial crisis. But it wasn't until years later, when Zink joined the team investigating the 2010 ""Flash Crash"" which briefly wiped nearly $1 trillion off U.S. stock markets, that the fraud division learned how widespread the practice was and decided to go after it. 
As seasoned prosecutors of healthcare fraud, the team believed they could apply the tools they had used to build those cases to the futures markets. That project began as an experiment in combing government data to sniff out suspicious patterns, such as doctors repeatedly overbilling hours, and has led the agency to bring charges against over 4,200 defendants, Justice Department data show.
""The idea was: let's mine this data source to see who the worst actors are. Let's not wait for walk-ins or whistleblowers and the like to make our own cases,"" said Zink.
Around 2017, the fraud unit began developing those tools to spot known suspicious trading patterns and learn new ones by scanning a range of exchange data on bids and offers and trades, he said. 
That led the agency to charge about more than a dozen current and former traders at banks including  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), UBS and Bank of Nova Scotia from 2017 to 2019.
To be sure, proving criminal charges is tough and the Justice Department has had setbacks convincing juries with reams of data that traders intended to manipulate the market when cancelling orders.
""Juries don’t understand the data and in a trial they hear competing narratives from experts, and the burden of proof is high. The government has an uphill battle when they only have pattern evidence,"" said Clifford Histed, an attorney with K&L Gates. 
Still, lawyers say the threat of criminal prosecution is a strong deterrence which has surfaced witnesses who can help the agencies refine their data tools and build other cases. 
For example, Navinder Sarao, who pleaded guilty to spoofing trades that helped cause the ""Flash Crash,"" gave the agencies extensive information on such tactics. 
""We could identify a pattern that led us down a road to potential criminality, and then we could close alternative avenues for explanation through cooperation,"" Zink said of Sarao. 
CFTC COLLABORATION
As part of its initiative, the Justice Department has increasingly worked in parallel with the CFTC, a civil agency, which over the past three years has gathered more detailed daily trading data from the exchanges it supervises, officials said.
The CFTC brought a record 16 parallel enforcement actions with criminal authorities in its fiscal 2019. 
CFTC director of enforcement James McDonald declined to comment on potential probes of recent market volatility, but said the data expertise put the agency on a stronger footing than following the previous financial crisis.
""As we bring more cases in these areas and as our surveillance efforts (and companies’) improve, we should expect spoofing strategies to continue to evolve in an effort to evade detection,"" McDonald said. ""Our job is to keep pace with this evolution.""
Traditionally, spoofing involved placing one large bid or offer and then swiftly cancelling it, but CFTC's McDonald said regulators have seen new patterns emerge.
These include traders coordinating strategies, with one placing the bogus spoof order and one the genuine order, or placing spoof orders in one market to allow them to execute genuine orders in correlated markets.
Most recently, the CFTC has detected traders placing bogus orders and genuine orders on the same side of the market and then abruptly canceling the spoof orders to create the impression of a major change in buying or selling interest.
The CFTC brought its first ever case alleging this ""vacuuming"" strategy against Chicago trading firm Hard Eight Futures LLC and its founder Igor Chernomzav last year. The parties agreed to pay $2.5 million to settle the civil charges. 
A representative for Hard Eight did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Justice Department's JPMorgan probe highlights the risks for companies as the agency scans for a broader range of misconduct. It has charged six JPMorgan traders for manipulating metals futures between 2008 and 2016. Authorities recently began probing ""similar"" practices in its treasuries business, according to company filings.
A spokesman for JP Morgan declined to comment.
Brian Benczkowski, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's criminal division, declined to comment on specific probes, but said that the agency's software could lead it to widen investigations where it initially appeared a handful of traders were breaking the rules. 

""The more widespread the behavior the more likely [we are] to proceed against the institution and seek a criminal resolution.""

1546,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 05:16AM ET</span>",Cacophony of voices on LME floor may not be heard for many months,"By Eric Onstad and Pratima Desai
LONDON (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange's open outcry trading floor may remain closed for many more months as it cannot be reopened under COVID-19 social distancing restrictions, the head of the exchange said.
LME Chief Executive Matthew Chamberlain also told Reuters the exchange would look at potential M&A activity, but nothing was on the agenda currently.
""The challenge we have with the ring is that it's all or nothing,"" he said in an interview.
""It is certainly a possibility that if social distancing is required for many more months, then the ring is closed for many more months."" 
The 143-year-old LME temporarily closed the ring - the last open-outcry floor in Europe - on March 23 when the coronavirus lockdown began.
While nearly every other financial exchange moved to screen trading, the LME has been one of the last bastions where traders still do live deals in a circle of padded, red-leather benches.
Floor dealers on the exchange, the world's oldest and largest market for industrial metals, have resisted the shift to full digital trading during the virus pandemic.
Chamberlain said the transition to fully electronic trading has been smooth, with no complaints from members or clients.
The future of the ring has been under scrutiny for years, with one faction arguing that the LME should join the global move to digital trading while others worry about losing flexibility for physical metals business. 
While the success of screen trading opens up the potential for scrapping the ring, Chamberlain said the LME would not be pressing that case but leave it up to users to reopen this conversation following the return of the ring.
""Although we've shown things work well without the ring, things work well with the ring as well. You could now have a conversation with members, should they wish, about which is better for the long term,"" he said.
Only nine Category 1 members are allowed to trade on the floor of the LME - owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. (HK:0388) - where complex trades to adjust contracts generate extra revenue.
The LME is unique among exchanges in that it allows users to lock in prices for individual days for the first three months forward and weekly up to six months - meaning there are hundreds of potential dates to trade and adjust. 
Chamberlain said one area not tested completely was having an extremely busy final ""kerb"" session that determines the closing prices for the LME's complex forward curve.
The ring has its roots in the early 19th century when the Royal Exchange, the world's first commodities market, became so crowded that metal merchants gathered at the Jerusalem coffee house on Cornhill in the City of London to conduct business.

LONDON (Reuters) - Equity markets slipped on Thursday on concerns about the long-term impact of the new coronavirus and simmering U.S.-China tensions, though those worries couldn't stop oil prices from marching to a 2-1/2 month high.
The London (FTSE), Frankfurt <.GDAX> and Paris (FCHI) bourses and Wall Street futures were all 0.7%-1% lower in early trading, while the euro (EUR=) and pound  both wilted as the dollar snapped a four-day losing streak. 
It was also a big day for data and central bankers. Purchasing manager index surveys (PMIs) from Germany and France had already confirmed that economic activity has begun to return, though they were far from stellar.
Despite better-than-expected euro zone-wide figures Germany's improvement undershot analysts' forecasts, and it was the third month in a row that the surveys were firmly in economic contraction territory.
""While we have seen resilience in European markets there is still caution, and we can't seem to get over the peaks (in equity markets) that we saw at the end of last month,"" said CMC Markets' senior analyst Michael Hewson. 
""We have got PMIs improving but you would expect that because lockdowns are being eased. They are still rubbish, they are just less rubbish than they were in April.""
Italy and Spain's government borrowing costs also rose slightly as bond market investors waited for bond sales from both and for more details on a proposed 500 billion euro ($550 billion) EU coronavirus recovery fund. 
The Franco-German driven plan would push the bloc in the direction of joint financing but has been met with resistance from a number of other northern European countries who want the aid to be in the form of loans to be repaid rather than grants. 
The 10-year BTP yield was up 1.1 basis points at 1.64%, not far from the 1.59% low it touched on Tuesday, while Spanish yields rose 2.4 bps at 0.73%.
OIL ON THE BOIL
U.S. weekly jobless claims are seen coming in later at a seasonally adjusted 2.4 million, according to a Reuters survey of economists - high but well off the record 6.867 million seen at the end of March.  
There will also be a raft of U.S. Federal Reserve speakers, including Fed chair Powell, and two big emerging market central banks – Turkey and South Africa - are expected to cut their interest rates again.
In Asia overnight, Japan's Nikkei stock index (N225) slid 0.2% after data there showed the country's exports collapsed 21.9% in April. Another dismal trade report came from Korea where 20-day exports declined by 20.3% year-on-year and imports fell by 16.9%, though Korean stocks still ended the day higher.
Shares in China had ended down 0.2% after more sparring with Washington over the coronavirus and Hong Kong and Taiwan emerged. Friday's annual National People's Congress (NPC) meeting was also looming after a 2-1/2 month delay due to COVID-19.
The focus will be on Premier Li Keqiang's 2020 work report where he is expected to announce key economic targets and details on fiscal stimulus plans. 
In the currency markets, the dollar climbed to $1.0956 per euro (EUR=EBS) and rose to $1.2291 against the British pound . The greenback also gained against the Australian  and New Zealand dollars , reflecting the cautious mood of the markets.
No such issues in the oil world though, where U.S. crude rose 1.9% to $34.09 a barrel and Brent jumped 1.8% to $36.39 per barrel. Both are now at the highest since early March on hopes that demand for fuel will see a robust global pick up.

U.S. crude inventories fell by 5 million barrels last week, against expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.2 million-barrel rise, Energy Information Administration (EIA) data had showed.

LONDON (Reuters) - The collapse in oil prices to 21-year lows has led potential buyers of oil and gas fields to try and renegotiate deals already agreed at higher prices, with the first examples emerging of sellers having their hand forced. 
At a time when most oil companies are slashing budgets, dividends and headcounts to preserve cash, sellers are facing a difficult choice between sweetening the deal or risking losing it altogether.
Premier Oil's CEO said he is seeking a cheaper price for North Sea (NYSE:SE) assets it agreed to buy from BP (NYSE:BP) for $625 million and Energean is doing the same with a $700 million purchase from Edison.
""The oil industry is revisiting its ‘before coronavirus’ (BC) bids, and we envisage announcements from other firms as they re-price or repackage previously announced deals,"" said Royal Bank of Canada oil and gas equity analyst Al Stanton.
Total this month decided to walk away from its purchase of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY)'s assets in Ghana, which hit a glitch over part of the French firm's wider deal with U.S. Occidental.
""Given the extraordinary market environment and the lack of visibility that the group faces... Total has decided not to pursue the completion of the purchase of the Ghana assets,"" Total said in a statement.
Among deals currently on the table, private equity group Blackstone (NYSE:BX) with its North Sea vehicle Siccar Point, was already disagreeing with another private equity firm, Chrysaor, over price even before the slump in March, sources said.
However, privately held Hilcorp Energy and private-equity firm HitecVision have successfully renegotiated deals with energy majors BP and Total, respectively, during the current oil price meltdown.
""Sellers, especially the majors, have certainly been very constructive,"" said one industry banker.
Hilcorp's new agreement retains the original sale price but provides for vendor financing, smaller payments in 2020 and for cash-flow sharing in the near term, BP said. The terms may lead to BP receiving less cash at the end of the day.
Total on Wednesday said it agreed to restructure a deal, initially set at $635 million, to sell North Sea oilfields to HitecVision's NEO unit to reflect ""current market conditions while retaining the majority of the value of the transaction."" This included lending money to the buyer.
""It is my view that all deals... in general will be a mixture of initial payments that are suitable for the current market and earn out or commodity price payments that allow sellers to get good deals as the volatility subsides,"" HitecVision Senior Partner John Knight said.
""Vendor finance with junior (debt) facilities, working capital and marketing and hedging arrangements and in some cases tax transfers and allocations and decommissioning security arrangements will all be tools all sellers and buyers will use in markets like this.""
Earn-out or upside sharing means the seller will only be paid once the oil price exceeds a certain limit.
HitecVision said it is on the prowl for more acquisitions in the British North Sea. In Norway, Aker BP and Lundin may be on the lookout for cheap assets, while OKEA and DNO, which took control of UK’s Faroe Petroleum last year, are also looking to grow. 
For some producers, like North Africa and gas-focused SDX, current oil prices do represent a ""catalyst for opportunities"", but Chief Executive Mark Reid said vendor financing, such as becoming the sellers' debtor, is a double-edged sword.
""It's clearly something that helps to sell the asset and put it into the hands of a smaller company... It is an interesting dynamic that the majors are able to use their balance sheet to facilitate (mergers and acquisitions),"" he said.

""We continue to talk to our contacts at BP, and other majors. (But) most importantly, (we plan) so that the company doesn't find itself drowned in debt.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) is in advanced talks over a 9 billion euros ($9.9 billion) state bailout that would see Germany take a 20% stake in its flagship airline, as countries battle to save an aviation industry hammered by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Lufthansa said on Thursday a deal would involve the government taking two seats on its supervisory board, but it would only exercise its full voting rights in exceptional circumstances, such as to protect the firm against a takeover.
Lufthansa has been in talks with Berlin for weeks over aid to help it cope with what is expected to be a protracted travel slump, but has been wrangling over how much control to yield in return for support.
Sources involved in the negotiations said the government's economic stabilisation fund had not yet put forward a final offer, but should do so on Thursday.
Rivals such as Franco-Dutch group Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and U.S. carriers American Airlines (O:AAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) have also sought state aid. 
Lufthansa said it expected conditions of the deal to include the waiver of future dividend payments and limits on management pay, adding the package would have to be approved by the European Commission.
The plan includes a 3 billion euro loan from the state-backed bank KfW and a convertible bond, which could be exchanged for a further 5% stake plus one share in the event of a public takeover offer by a third party. 
Lufthansa said it hoped the deal could be concluded promptly to secure its long-term solvency.
German media reported late on Wednesday that a deal had been done and Chancellor Angela Merkel said she expects an agreement on a rescue package soon, but did not elaborate.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel's Sonovia Ltd, which makes washable and reusable anti-viral masks, is considering going public on Nasdaq by the end of this year, its chief technology officer said.
The masks are coated in zinc oxide nano-particles that destroy bacteria, fungi and viruses, and the company says they can help stop the spread of COVID-19. 
""We believe we will complete the (IPO) process at the end of this year,"" CTO Liat Goldhammer told Reuters. ""We are targeting a valuation of $50 million. We are doing the legal and accounting process now.""
A successful listing depends on many factors, including the scale-up of production, the company said.
Goldhammer said Sonovia's masks are not certified for use by medical professionals in operating and emergency rooms, which use only disposable masks.
But tests of its fabric show effectiveness of nearly 99% against viruses similar to COVID-19 and the fabric remains potent through 100 washes at high temperatures, she said.
While COVID-19 is not available for testing of commercial products, the material was tested at Austria's HygCen medical lab this month using Vaccinia virus, which has similar properties to the SARS-COVID family.
The tests showed ""a good virucidal effect"", according to the lab report.
Some $18 million has been invested in the technology, which began as research at Israel's Bar Ilan University. This includes 12 million euros ($13 million) in grants from the European Union.
Goldhammer said that as companies bring people back to work after the coronavirus crisis and need masks, many are concerned about the environment and are seeking alternatives to single-use N95 masks.
Sonovia's clients include German manufacturers Bruckner and Weber Ultrasonics, and hospitals in Germany and the United States. The company did not provide figures for sales of the masks, which are also sold online to consumers.

Investing.com - European stock markets sold off Thursday, with investors wary following disappointing economic data from Asia and ahead of the latest U.S. jobless numbers.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.1% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 1%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.7%.
Earlier Thursday, a trade report from South Korea, a bellwether for global commerce, showed exports may be set to drop more than 20% in May for a second month. Meanwhile, Japan’s overseas shipments also plunged by more than a fifth in April and a purchasing managers index showed manufacturing activity weakening further in May in the world’s third-largest economy.
Data in Europe showed some improvement, with Germany's flash composite Purchasing Managers' Index rising to 31.4 after hitting a record low of 17.4 the previous month and France’s measure of services and manufacturing rose to 30.5 from 11.1 in April, it said Thursday. 
However, these figures both still signal contraction, and businesses remain pessimistic about the next 12 months.
Attention will now turn to the release of the key weekly U.S. jobless claims figures, at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), with economists looking for a dip from last week, but a slight one as companies are still forced to shed jobs.
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to come in at 2.4 million, compared with nearly 3 million the week before.
In corporate news, U.K.-based airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) gained over 4% after saying it will resume flights on June 15, starting mainly with domestic flying in the U.K. and France before adding further routes over the coming weeks. 
Staying in the sector, Deutsche Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) soared over 6% after confirming Thursday that it is in advanced talks with the German economic stabilization fund for up to 9 billion euros ($9.84 billion) in state aid.
The crude oil market headed higher Thursday, helped by the Energy Information Administration reporting an oil inventory draw of 5 million barrels for the week to May 15.

HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) plans to hire at least 12 equity research analysts in China this year, two people with knowledge of the matter said, in its first major mainland hiring push as it takes advantage of eased ownership rules for financial firms.
With the headcount expansion for its new brokerage business, the bank's research arm aims to more than double the number of China-listed firms it covers in five years from about 225, the people said.
A JPMorgan spokeswoman in Hong Kong declined to comment.
The move indicates the beginning of an expected hiring spree by global banks taking control of their China operations and expanding offerings as the government opens up capital markets. Reflecting client interest, foreign holders of Chinese stocks reached a record high in September.
China is a ""critical market"" for clients globally, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in December, when the bank received regulatory approval to establish a majority-owned securities joint venture, offering brokerage, investment advisory and underwriting services.
China has been pushing ahead with opening up its financial services sector despite disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. It has also continued to let U.S. firms increase their presence despite tension with Washington.
Last month, a U.S. investment advisory founded by Wall Street trader William O'Neil won approval to launch local-currency funds and plans to seek a licence to raise money for offshore investment.
In April, JPMorgan said it would increase its stake in a Chinese mutual fund venture to 100% and would seek full control of its futures business.
The United States' biggest bank is targeting local as well as global brokerages to hire analysts in the months ahead, one of the people told Reuters. It will bolster coverage in technology, biotechnology and automobiles, the person said.

The bank has already hired about half a dozen bankers for its equities business in China, the person said, including former UBS Group AG (S:UBSG) banker David Xu who joined in June to lead the business.

Luxury retailers, including Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) and Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI), are among the worst-hit firms as the pandemic pushes consumers to snub discretionary products for essentials, forcing companies to furlough employees and slash investments.
The Wall Street Journal had first reported on the layoffs. 
The company said last month it was planning to reopen its Canadian facilities to make personal protective equipment (PPE), adding that, at full capacity, as many as 900 employees across Canada were going to be working to produce PPEs.

In March, the company suspended the long-term outlook it had provided last year.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will decide whether to lift the state of emergency in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo later in the day. But Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba and Hokkaido will remain under the state of emergency.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.51%. Down Under the ASX 200 dropped 0.05%, also giving up its earlier gains.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.02%. It gained earlier in the session after the U.S. Senate passed a bill on Wednesday that could lead to Chinese companies that do not comply with security laws and auditing regulations being barred from listing on U.S. exchanges.
The bill’s passage raised hopes that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange stands to benefit should the bill pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by President Donald Trump, with more Chinese companies potentially choosing to list in Hong Kong.

(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (N:MA) will not ask employees to return to its worldwide corporate offices until they are comfortable that the sometimes fatal coronavirus is under control with vaccines or other measures, a senior executive told Reuters on Wednesday. 
The world's second-largest payment processor is also looking at its real-estate footprint and considering consolidating offices, Chief People Officer Michael Fraccaro said.
""We expect in the coming weeks and months that more employees will continue to work from home than come into office,"" he said. ""And we are OK with that. We support that choice.""
While some Mastercard staff have young children or parents to look after, others are concerned about taking public transport to work.
""We have stated upfront to all our employees, that it is their choice ... we want them to make the decision on when they feel comfortable returning to the office,"" he said. 
The company employs nearly 20,000 people globally, with its main headquarters in Westchester, a New York City suburb. Mastercard owns that campus, which it purchased from  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) in 1994. 
When the situation stabilizes, companies around the world may find that their offices are only about 30% full, Fraccaro said, leading Mastercard to think about its future real-estate needs. 
Mastercard joins other technology and financial firms that have said they do not plan to implement widespread get-back-to-the-office initiatives any time soon, including its main rivals  American Express  Co (N:AXP) and  Visa Inc  (N:V).
Mastercard has created a ""future of work"" task force that is figuring out how best to handle real estate and employee needs, Fraccaro said.
About 90% of its workforce is operating remotely, including those based in overseas locations including Beijing and Shanghai, Fraccaro said. Employees who work in offices must follow social distancing rules, wear masks and undergo temperature checks, he said.

""Once there is adequate testing and there is a vaccine and people feel comfortable to return, then we may see more,"" he said. ""But in the early phases it will be vastly less than what we had.""

1560,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 11:00PM ET</span>",Insurance comparison firm SelectQuote raises $360 million in IPO,"By Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. insurance policy comparison website SelectQuote Inc (N:SLQT) raised $360 million after selling shares in its initial public offering (IPO) above its target range on Wednesday.
SelectQuote's offering is the latest sign of thawing in the IPO market, which was shut to most companies when the coronavirus outbreak fueled weeks of stock market volatility in March and April. Only a handful of biotechnology and blank-check companies went ahead with IPOs during this period.
Since late February, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, has been above the 20-point threshold that most IPO hopefuls monitor to gauge investor jitters. But it has trended downwards in recent weeks, giving some companies confidence to test the market.
SelectQuote allows consumers to compare insurance policies for life, auto and home insurance from providers including American International Group (N:AIG), Prudential Financial Inc (N:PRU) and Liberty Mutual.
The biggest IPO by a company that is neither a biotechnology firm nor special purpose acquisition company since the onset of the pandemic was by Chinese cloud computing company  Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Ltd  (O:KC), which raised $510 million in its U.S. stock market debut earlier this month.
Overland Park, Kansas-based SelectQuote said it sold 18 million shares as planned, and existing shareholders sold 10.5 million shares, up from 7 million, at $20 each as part of the IPO. The company had set a target range of between $17 and $19 per share.
The IPO valued SelectQuote at $3.25 billion. The pricing of the IPO was brought forward by a day on the back of strong investor demand. Shares of SelectQuote peer  EverQuote  Inc (O:EVER) hit a record high earlier this month, after the company increased its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA forecast. EverQuote also said it expects the virus outbreak to accelerate the digitization of the insurance industry. While using websites to compare and buy insurance products is commonplace around the world, the U.S. insurance industry has been slower to embrace technology as means of bypassing traditional insurance brokers.
For the nine months to the end of March, SelectQuote posted $390.1 million in revenue, up almost 50% year on year while net income edged up 2.4% to $61.1 million.
The company's stock is set to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday under the symbol ""SLQT"".
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are the lead underwriters for the IPO.

1561,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>","Japan to Keep Tokyo Under Virus Emergency, Lift Osaka Order","(Bloomberg) -- Japan is looking to lift its state of emergency for the Osaka region as early as Thursday, but keep the order in place for Tokyo, where cases have not yet fallen below a government threshold.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, responsible for the government’s virus response, told reporters Thursday ahead of a meeting of a government advisory panel on the pandemic that it’s appropriate to lift the measure in Osaka and two adjoining prefectures and didn’t suggest lifting it for the Tokyo region.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to formalize the decision Thursday after hearing from the panel, Kyodo News reported citing unnamed officials. The emergency declaration would stay in effect for Tokyo and surrounding prefectures, as well as the northern island of Hokkaido, public broadcaster NHK reported.
Japan has seen a steady fall in its new confirmed infections over the past few weeks and has overall numbers for confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths that rank among the lowest among Group of Seven leading democracies. Abe last week lifted the state of emergency for 39 of the country’s 47 prefectures and it was on track to be removed in all places by, or before, the current planned expiry of May 31.
Lifting the emergency would help re-open more parts of the virus-battered economy, which sank last quarter into a recession, data this week showed. Abe said last week the government was preparing a second extra budget to aid people and businesses reeling from the effects of the pandemic that includes handouts to help with rent, and raises the maximum subsidy for furloughed workers to 15,000 yen ($140) a day.
The troubles for the world’s third-largest economy are likely to deepen further as households limit spending to essentials and companies cut back on investment, production and hiring to stay afloat. Analysts see a 21.5% contraction this quarter, a record for official data going back to 1955.
Tokyo, neighboring Kanagawa and Hokkaido were slightly above the government threshold of 0.5 new cases per 100,000 people in a week, Kyodo reported, and were on a trajectory to be under the threshold before the end of the month.
The state of emergency, first declared in some areas on April 6, allows local governments to direct businesses to close and to urge residents to stay in their homes, though there are no penalties for failure to comply.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>",Asset managers lending to short-sellers can be ethical: study,"By Alun John
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asset managers lending out of their securities can be compatible with investment on environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles, an industry body said on Thursday, adding it was working on drawing up guidelines.
Owners of shares or other securities can lend them, for a fee, to other investors who wish to hold them temporarily to short the stock, or for other purposes, such as hedging.
Often highly profitable for the lenders, opponents of the practice say it can conflict with ESG investing, a trend that accounts for investment worth tens of trillions of dollars.
A Pan Asia Securities Lending Association (PASLA) survey of its members found 89% of respondents said that securities lending could be compatible with ESG principles, if certain measures were put in place.
""There are three core topics that normally come up: proxy voting, collateral and transparency,"" Stuart Jones, PASLA's chairman, said.
These cover whether and how asset owners should have their shares returned to them to allow them to vote at AGMs, what collateral they were given in exchange for the shares - in case these did not meet asset owners' ESG requirements - and whether borrowers of shares could lend them on further without informing the owner, Jones said.
""A lot of people - but certainly not all- have not considered what ESG needs to look like when lending securities,"" Jones said. PASLA is working with the industry to create a set of ESG principles.
Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's largest pension fund, last year stopped lending of its overseas shares for short-selling, calling the practice inconsistent with its responsibilities as a long-term investor.
Asset managers earned more than $10 billion in 2019 from charging fees to borrowers of their securities, IHS Markit found.

The re-proposed rule from the Federal Housing Finance Agency would establish a bank-like capital regime for the two and require them to establish capital cushions worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The goal would be to ensure they would be able to continue to provide a backstop for the mortgage market in a housing downturn, and eventually be freed from a 12-year government bailout.
""More capital means a stronger foundation on which to weather crises. The time to act is now,"" said FHFA Director Mark Calabria in a statement.
The new proposal is the FHFA's second attempt at creating a new capital plan, building on a previous proposal put out in 2018 under prior leadership. The new plan would establish higher capital requirements for the two - if the proposal had been in effect in 2019, the pair would have had a cushion of roughly $243 billion, the FHFA said. 
But the proposal also attempts to make the cushion more risk-sensitive, with an eye towards ensuring capital and liquidity buffers could be used by Fannie and Freddie in an economic downturn to continue guaranteeing mortgages and keeping home loans affordable.

The new proposal is open to public comment, and the FHFA would like to finalize it by the end of 2020 so Fannie and Freddie could look to raise outside capital sometime in 2021, agency officials said.

In their letter, the lawmakers said the deal would give Uber and Grubhub 48 percent of the U.S. market, while Doordash would have 42 percent. A merged Uber Eats and Grubhub would have 79 percent of the market in New York, 68 percent in Boston, 65 percent in Miami, 60 percent in Chicago and 51 percent in Atlanta.
""We have been hearing about the exorbitant fees that these online delivery app companies charge to restaurants, which are then forced to pass these excessive costs on to consumers,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""It is particularly troubling that this merger is being contemplated during a pandemic, when consumer demand has increased and when restaurants are more desperate for revenue than ever.""
News broke on May 12 that Uber had approached Grubhub with an offer for an all-stock deal. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.

The letter from Klobuchar, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, as well as Senators Patrick Leahy, Richard Blumenthal and Cory Booker was addressed to Makan Delrahim, head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division and Joseph Simons, head of the Federal Trade Commission. The two agencies ensure that mergers comply with antitrust law.

1565,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 07:36PM ET</span>",Singapore Gets Closer and Closer to a Sub-Zero Interest Rate,"(Bloomberg) -- Singapore is just a whisker away from joining the global negative-rate club.
The nation’s overnight borrowing rate was less than two basis points above zero on Tuesday, down from the year’s high of 1.68% in January. It has never gone negative before based on central bank data compiled by Bloomberg.
The plunge in the benchmark rate comes as the Monetary Authority of Singapore promised to provide sufficient liquidity in the financial system to cope with the virus-induced crunch. As the MAS doesn’t set rates, but instead manages the currency against major trading partners as a policy tool, the city state’s borrowing costs also tend to track U.S.’s benchmark.
The close relationship between the borrowing costs of both countries may well drive Singapore’s interest rate below zero as speculation mounts over the possibility of negative rates in the U.S., according to Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Singapore.
The drop in money-market rates may be a “possible by-product” of MAS operations that are meant to ensure sufficient liquidity, but is certainly not the intent, he added. Any decline into negative terrain will be short-lived, he said.
Singapore’s one-month swap rate, a benchmark borrowing cost for offshore investors, is also about two basis points above zero. That too has plunged from a high of 1.64% in February as speculation of U.S. negative rate policy drove down borrowing costs in the country. The swap rate is computed based on the London interbank offered rate for the dollar as well as currency forwards.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 06:40PM ET</span>",Ford shuts two U.S. assembly plants due to COVID-19 infections,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Wednesday closed two U.S. assembly plants as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked early havoc with the No. 2 U.S. automaker's plan to restart North American production and begin making its most profitable vehicles again.
Ford closed its Dearborn, Michigan, plant due to a positive COVID-19 test by one worker, while its Chicago assembly plant was closed due to a parts shortage, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said. 
Ford declined to say which supplier had the issue, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that  Lear  (NYSE:LEA) Corp had closed a plant in Hammond, Indiana. Lear later confirmed in an email that it had closed the plant due to a positive test.
It was the second day in a row Ford had closed its Chicago plant, after closing it twice on Tuesday after two workers on different shifts also tested positive. Both the Dearborn and Chicago plants are expected to resume production later on Wednesday, Felker said.
In the Dearborn and Chicago positive tests, all exposure occurred outside the workplace, Felker said. Dearborn builds the highly profitable F-150 pickup truck, while the Chicago plant makes the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs.
The U.S. auto industry, including Ford, reopened many plants on Monday after a long shutdown due to the outbreak. To ensure safe operation amid the health crisis, Ford and other automakers and suppliers imposed new safety measures, including screening employees who enter the building, mandating the use of face masks and face shields, and social distancing along the assembly line where possible.
The reopening of car plants will be a closely watched test of whether workers across a range of U.S. industries will be able to return to factories in large numbers without a resurgence of infections.

General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Wednesday they had no issues at any North American plants.

1567,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",China’s Got a New Plan to Seize the World’s Tech Crown From the U.S.,"(Bloomberg) -- Beijing is accelerating its bid for global leadership in key technologies, planning to pump more than a trillion dollars into the economy through the rollout of everything from wireless networks to artificial intelligence.
In the masterplan backed by President Xi Jinping himself, China will invest an estimated $1.4 trillion over six years to 2025, calling on urban governments and private tech giants like Huawei Technologies Co. to lay fifth generation wireless networks, install cameras and sensors, and develop AI software that will underpin autonomous driving to automated factories and mass surveillance.
The new infrastructure initiative is expected to drive mainly local giants from  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Huawei to SenseTime Group Ltd. at the expense of U.S. companies. As tech nationalism mounts, the investment drive will reduce China’s dependence on foreign technology, echoing objectives set forth previously in the Made in China 2025 program. Such initiatives have already drawn fierce criticism from the Trump administration, resulting in moves to block the rise of Chinese tech companies such as Huawei.
“Nothing like this has happened before, this is China’s gambit to win the global tech race,” said Digital China Holdings Chief Operating Officer Maria Kwok, as she sat in a Hong Kong office surrounded by facial recognition cameras and sensors. “Starting this year, we are really beginning to see the money flow through.”
The tech investment push is part of a fiscal package waiting to be signed off by China’s legislature, which convenes this week. The government is expected to announce infrastructure funding of as much as $563 billion this year, against the backdrop of the country’s worst economic performance since the Mao era.
The nation’s biggest purveyors of cloud computing and data analysis Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. will be linchpins of the upcoming endeavor. China has already entrusted Huawei to galvanize 5G. Tech leaders including Pony Ma and Jack Ma are espousing the program.
Maria Kwok’s company is a government-backed systems integration provider, among many that are jumping at the chance. In the southern city of Guangzhou, Digital China is bringing half a million units of project housing online, including a complex three quarters the size of Central Park. To find a home, a user just has to log on to an app, scan their face and verify their identity. Leases can be signed digitally via smartphone and the renting authority is automatically flagged if a tenant’s payment is late.
China is no stranger to far-reaching plans with massive price tags that appear to achieve little. There’s no guarantee this program will deliver the economic rejuvenation its proponents promise. Unlike previous efforts to resuscitate the economy with “dumb” bridges and highways, this newly laid digital infrastructure will help national champions develop cutting-edge technologies.
What BloombergNEF Says
China’s new stimulus plan will likely lead to a consolidation of industrial internet providers, and could lead to the emergence of some larger companies able to compete with global leaders such as GE and Siemens. One bet is on industrial internet-of-things platforms as China aims to cultivate three world leading companies in this area by 2025.

China isn’t alone in pumping money into the tech sector as a way to get out of the post-virus economic slump. Earlier this month, South Korea said AI and wireless communications would be at the core of it its “New Deal” to create jobs and boost growth.
According to the government-backed China Center for Information Industry Development, the 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) that China is estimated to spend from now until 2025 encompasses areas typically considered leading edge such as AI and IoT as well as items such as ultra-high voltage lines and high-speed rail.
Separate estimates by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) put new infrastructure at around $180 billion each year for the next 11 years -- or $1.98 trillion in total. Those calculations also include power and rail lines. That annual figure would be almost double the past three-year average, the investment bank said in a March report that listed key stock beneficiaries including companies such as China Tower Corp., Alibaba, GDS Holdings (NASDAQ:GDS), Quanta Computer Inc. and Advantech Co.
Beijing’s half-formed vision is already stirring a plethora of stocks, a big reason why five of China’s 10 best-performing stocks this year are tech plays like networking gear maker Dawning Information Industry Co. and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier GoerTek Inc. The bare outlines of the masterplan were enough to drive pundits toward everything from satellite operators to broadband providers.
It’s unlikely that U.S companies will benefit much from the tech-led stimulus and in some cases they stand to lose existing business. Earlier this year when the country’s largest telecom carrier China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) awarded contracts for 37 billion yuan in 5G base stations, the lion’s share went to Huawei and other Chinese companies. Sweden’s Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) got only a little over 10% of the business in the first four months. In one of its projects, Digital China will help the northeastern city of Changchun swap out American cloud computing staples  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and EMC (NYSE:EMC) with home-grown technology.
It’s in data centers that a considerable chunk of the new infrastructure development will take place. Over 20 provinces have launched policies to support enterprises utilizing cloud computing services, according to a March note from UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS). Tony Yu, chief executive officer of Chinese server maker H3C, that his company was seeing a significant increase in demand for data center services from some of the country’s top internet companies. “Rapid growth in up-and-coming sectors will bring a new force to China’s economy after the pandemic passes,” he told Bloomberg News.
From there, more investment should flow. Bain Capital-backed data center operator Chindata Group estimated that for every one dollar spent on data centers another $5 to $10 in investment in related sectors would take place, including in networking, power grid and advanced equipment manufacturing. “A whole host of supply-chain companies will benefit,” the company said in a statement.
There’s concern about whether this long-term strategy provides much in the way of stimulus now, and where the money will come from. “It’s impossible to prop up China’s economy with new infrastructure alone,” said Zhu Tian, professor of economics at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. “If you are worried about the government’s added debt levels and their debt servicing abilities right now, of course you wouldn’t do it. But it’s a necessary thing to do at a time of crisis.”
Digital China is confident that follow-up projects from its housing initiative in Guangzhou could generate 30 million yuan in revenue for the company. It’s also hoping to replicate those efforts with local governments in the northeastern province of Jilin, where it has 3.3 billion yuan worth of projects approved. These include building a so-called city brain that will for the first time connect databases including traffic, schools and civil matters such as marriage registry. “The concept of smart cities has been touted for years but now we are finally seeing the investment,” said Kwok.

Lufthansa is seeking to tap Germany's economic stabilisation fund to help it weather the coronavirus pandemic and what is expected to be a protracted travel slump.
The ministers in charge put the finishing touches on the bailout package and a government official was on his way to Frankfurt to seal the deal with airline managers, Der Spiegel magazine reported.
The German finance ministry and the economy ministry both declined to comment. A Lufthansa representative also declined any statement on the media report.
Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday she expects an agreement on a rescue package for Lufthansa soon, but did not elaborate.
In a separate report, the Handelsblatt newspaper cited government sources as saying Berlin had agreed to a three-stage model involving a total of 9 billion euros ($9.88 billion), including a 3 billion-euro loan from the state-owned KfW bank.
In addition, the government will take a direct stake of 20% in Lufthansa and a convertible bond worth 5% plus one share, with the government gaining two seats on the company's supervisory board.
The airline said on May 7 it was negotiating a 9 billion-euro bailout with the German government to ensure its future, confirming an earlier Reuters report.
Lufthansa said then that the package included a non-voting capital component, known as a so-called silent participation, a secured loan, and a capital increase which may leave the government with a shareholding of up to 25% plus one share.

The Handelsblatt newspaper said the agreement now had to be approved by the coalition government, which would then give Lufthansa two days to agree.

Investing.com - Wall Street kept its gains throughout the session today, finishing with another strong gain as economic reopening hopes continue to bring in the buyers.
The Federal Reserve’s April minutes also helped as its dire warnings were countered by its further pledges to do what it takes with any and all monetary policy tools.
Tomorrow there will be more data on employment, housing, manufacturing and services activity.
And one of Wall Street’s favorite tech stocks will report earnings after the bell.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Jobless Claims Seen Dipping; Existing Home Sales Expected to Dive
Tomorrow brings the weekly jobless claims figures, with economists looking for a dip from last week, but a slight one as companies are still forced to shed jobs
The Labor Department will report the numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to come in at 2.4 million, compared with nearly 3 million the week before, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.Continuing claims are expected to have risen to nearly 24.8 million.


At 10:00 AM ET the latest figures on existing home sales arrive from the National Association of Realtors.
Economists predict that sales of existing homes plunged 18.9% in April to an annual rate of 4.3 million.
2. Manufacturing to Show Some Green Shoots?
Looking to the manufacturing sector, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve will release its measure of regional activity at 8:30 AM ET (12;30 GMT).
The May Philly Fed index is expected to show improvement, rising to -41.5 from -56.6 in April, close to an all-time low, according to economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
At 9:45 AM ET, Markit releases its manufacturing and services purchasing managers indexes (PMIs).

The services PMI is forecast to edge up to 30 from 26.7.
3. Bull Favorite Nvidia to Report
Semiconductor company Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will issues its earnings after the bell tomorrow, which come on the heels of a strong rally in shares, sending them close to all-time highs.
“While the chipmaker is unlikely to escape the overall demand slowdown due to Covid-19 closures, analysts are focusing on the company’s balance sheet, cash flow, and product categories, each of which is expected to remain strong in the current environment,” Investing.com’s Haris Anwar wrote.
The company also received votes of confidence from Wall Street leading up to earnings day.
On Tuesday, Susquehanna boosted its price target on the stock and on Monday BMO Capital Markets raised its rating to outperform from market perform.
""We have stayed on the sidelines long enough on the NVDA shares,” BMO said, according to Briefing.com. “While there is no one single event we can point to which has led us to change our thinking, the continued execution on the data center side, along with the latest product rollout, has helped. We believe NVIDIA is uniquely positioned to continue to benefit from a massive shift in the compute landscape.""
Analysts expect the chipmaker to report a profit of $1.66 per share on revenue of about $3 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com."

Investing.com – Wall Street ended strongly on Wednesday, led by large-cap tech stocks, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) hitting record highs as investors continued to cheer efforts to reopen the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.52%, or 369 points. The S&P 500 gained 1.67%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 2.08%.
With all U.S. States partially reopened, investors upped their bets on big tech stocks, with Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon and Facebook attracting strong bids.
Amazon and Facebook closed at record highs, with support in the latter sparked by its announcement from a day earlier, when the social media giant unveiled a new feature, Facebook Shops, which makes it easier for customers to sell on Instagram and Facebook.
Energy, meanwhile, was among the biggest gainers as U.S. oil prices climbed after weekly crude supplies fell, adding to optimism for a recovery in oil demand as economic reopening efforts continue.
Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), up 7.3%,  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR), up 7.7%, and Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC), up 6.8%, were among the notable movers in energy.
Financials, meanwhile, clawed back some of their losses from a day earlier, led by banks, though weaker U.S. Treasury yields kept a lid on gains.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) was up 3%, while Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) rose more than 2%.
The weaker backdrop for bond yields comes on a historic day in the Treasuries market as the Treasury sold 20-year bonds for the first time since 1986 as the U.S. seeks to fund its massive stimulus program.
On the earnings front, investors continued to digest mixed reports from retailers.
Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) cut gains to end roughly flat after executives warned that same-store sales growth is expected to ""moderate"" later in 2020. That cooled optimism on the stock after the company reported that same-store sales jumped 11% in its fiscal first quarter.
Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN) slumped 7.7% after its first-quarter losses swelled to $1.41 per share on revenue of $588 million, missing estimates for losses for $0.22 per share on revenue of $633.5 million.
In healthcare,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) cut gains to end 2.6% higher as  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) upgraded its price target on the stock to $90 from $37. Its shares fell 10% on Tuesday after a Stat news report suggested that recent optimism over the company's early-stage results for its potential Covid-19 vaccine was overdone.
In a further sign that U.S.-China trade tensions are more likely to escalate than ease, the U.S. Senate passed a bill that may delist Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) ended the day below the flatline, while JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ended flat.
On the monetary policy front, meanwhile, the Federal Reserve minutes showed that policymakers backed rates to remain lower for longer and also floated the idea of yield curve control.
""Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the minutes showed. "

(Reuters) - Travel website Kayak is seeing more demand for car rentals than air travel from customers looking to avoid crowds and stay closer to home as U.S. states reopen, Chief Executive Officer Steve Hafner told Reuters on Wednesday.
For those booking flights, Kayak, which is owned by Booking Holdings (O:BKNG), is seeing a preference for cities like Phoenix and Denver over hotspots such as Las Vegas and New York, and for beach destinations like Hawaii and Miami.
""We started Kayak as a flight search engine. I never would have guessed that almost 20 years later, we have cars on our home page.""
The COVID-19 pandemic has hammered the global travel industry as lockdowns imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus kept people confined to their homes, crippling airlines, hotels, cruises and casinos.
However, as U.S. states and major economies ease restrictions, airlines have said ticket cancellations are slowing and demand was improving.
SunTrust analyst Naved Khan forecast bookings for online travel agencies would fall about 60% in third quarter, compared with a more than 80% plunge in the second quarter.
Kayak is also looking at ways to show safety measures used by airlines in its search results.
""If it's helpful to the consumer to know that American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has one policy with regard to middle seats and Delta another, then we want to show that in the Kayak display,"" Hafner said.

Kayak is used by millions of travelers each year to book flights, hotels and rental cars.

BOSTON (Reuters) -  Northern Trust  Corp's decision to liquidate a $1.8-billion prime money market fund was seen as an outlier event by industry analysts on Wednesday, but one that could portend more problems depending on how the economy fares.
Money has rushed back into prime funds since the sector suffered major withdrawals in March, according to figures from researcher Peter Crane. Total prime fund assets stand at $1.1 trillion, with less than $1 billion of net customer withdrawals for the year to date.
One fund that has not seemed to benefit from the comeback is Northern Trust's (O:NTRS) Prime Obligations Fund  which recently had close to $4 billion in assets.
In filings on Monday, the company said its fund board determined to liquidate and terminate Prime Obligations around July 10, and return money to shareholders, with the action being in their ""best interests.""
The fund's manager in March had disclosed its liquidity level dipped temporarily.[nL1N2BG19H] Asked about the liquidation, Northern Trust spokesman Doug Holt said ""this decision was specific"" to the fund. 
Prime funds own a range of government, bank and commercial instruments. Other firms have injected cash into their prime funds or closed them to new investors, and the sector has received Federal Reserve support. [nFWN2C414W] 
Crane said Northern Trust's actions seem unique given the fund's small scale and the broader industry comeback. A bigger issue could be low interest rates that lead firms to waive fees, he said. 
Analyst Brian Reynolds of Reynolds Strategy LLC said more funds could liquidate if efforts to stimulate the economy don't succeed.

""The risk over the rest of the year is that more funds start to see redemptions as clients burn through cash that they just borrowed,"" he said.

1578,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 03:46PM ET</span>",FCA-PSA deal terms 'set in stone' for 50-50 merger,"By Giulio Piovaccari and Stephen Jewkes
MILAN (Reuters) - Terms of a planned merger between  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and Peugeot-owner PSA (PA:PEUP) are set in stone, FCA's chairman said on Wednesday, brushing off talk that some aspects of the deal might be re-negotiated because of the COVID-19 crisis.
FCA and PSA have entered a binding agreement to create the world's fourth largest carmaker that FCA's chairman John Elkann confirmed was expected to close in the first quarter of next year.
But FCA has come in for criticism in Italy over a 5.5 billion euro ($6.03 billion) special dividend that is part of the PSA deal after its local business said it was in talks with Rome and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) over a 6.3 billion euro state-backed loan to cope with the COVID-19 crisis.
The potential payment of such a big dividend to shareholders when the coronavirus crisis has left cash-starved manufacturers pushing for government support has been questioned within Italy's ruling coalition.
But FCA Chairman Elkann said the terms of the merger agreement had not changed.
""The terms of the FCA-PSA deal are set in stone as binding contracts in their nature are,"" Elkann said in conference call after the annual shareholder meeting of Exor (MI:EXOR), the Agnelli family holding company which controls FCA.
""It was a clear cash and equity agreement to reach a 50-50 merger deal between FCA shareholders and PSA shareholders,"" Elkann said.
""Both parties in FCA-PSA deal are committed to get parity in the merger deal.""
Elkann is also chairman and CEO of Exor.
The dividend - to be paid by parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in the Netherlands - is a central part of the overall value of the merger, but Italy could look into it, a senior government source has said.
""This is a loan which is really designed to help the automotive sector in Italy which we know is a very important part of the Italian economy,"" Elkann said, referring to the state-backed loan.
Treasury undersecretary Pier Paolo Baretta on Wednesday told Reuters that Rome might consider extending a ban on dividend payments for companies accessing state guarantee from an existing deadline of December 31, 2020 to a 12-month period following the loan guarantee concession.
""That would be reasonable. Doing more may hit the companies' value,"" Baretta said.
This could potentially complicate FCA's plans, as the special dividend payment is due just before the closing of the merger with PSA.
Some analysts suggested some of the merger's terms - in particular the amount of the special dividend, which was agreed before the coronavirus outbreak - could be reviewed to take account of the current state of the stock market and the automotive market and to preserve cash at the automaker.

Elkann said the reasons for FCA-PSA merger were ""stronger than ever"" and that preparatory work for the 50-50 tie-up was proceeding ""on time and as envisaged.""

1579,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Senate passes bill that could block Chinese firms from U.S. securities exchanges,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Wednesday that could prevent some Chinese companies from listing their shares on U.S. exchanges unless they follow standards for U.S. audits and regulations.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Senator John Kennedy and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, passed by unanimous consent. However, it must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law.
""The Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act"" bars securities of any company from being listed on any U.S. securities exchange if it has failed to comply with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's audits for three years in a row.
The measure also would require public companies disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a foreign government.
The bill is written to apply to all foreign companies, but it is targeted at China, and follows intense criticism of Beijing by Republican President Donald Trump that has been echoed by Republican and Democratic lawmakers.
Trump and other officials in his administration insist that China mishandled the novel coronavirus during the early weeks of an outbreak that has spread into a global pandemic that has killed more than 320,000 people and cratered global economies.
Beijing denies such allegations.
""There are plenty of markets all over the world open to cheaters, but America can't afford to be one of them. China is on a glidepath to dominance and is cheating at every turn,"" Kennedy said in a statement.

""For too long, Chinese companies have disregarded U.S. reporting standards, misleading our investors,"" Van Hollen said.

BETIM, Brazil (Reuters) - Before going to work these days, employees at the Brazilian unit of  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) have to get a health check using a mobile app every morning. 
It is one of several measures the automaker has implemented to fight the novel coronavirus in South America's top auto producing country. Carmakers in Brazil cautiously restarted production this month, concerned not just about the virus spreading, but also about whether there will be any demand for the cars amid the health crisis. 
But low demand also means less workers, which is helping keep employees apart. 
At FCA - Brazil's top auto seller when you combine its brands Fiat and Jeep - only 65% of its 11,000 workers are going to its factory in Betim, in the state of Minas Gerais. Others are furloughed or work from home. 
After they pass a mandatory health test at home, more than 90% of workers get to the factory by taking company buses, said Neylor Bastos, who heads FCA's health operations in Latin America. The company has bought more buses, he said, to ensure the vehicles operate half full for social distancing. 
""At the plant, we have a system that controls worker temperatures,"" Bastos said. ""All people are monitored and if anyone has a temperature over 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit), that person will go straight to the medical facility ... and then goes home."" 
He said if any worker tests positive for coronavirus, they will deep clean any areas where the person worked within a radius of 4 meters (13 feet), and trace any interaction the person may have had with nearby workers. 
Fiat Chrysler does not have a private supply of coronavirus tests, but Bastos said they are confident they can get tests through the national health system for any workers that need it, even though Brazil's health care system is strained. 
So far, Fiat Chrysler has not reported any coronavirus cases, the company said.

Calls to the metalworkers union in Betim went unanswered.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The three major averages on Wall St were poised for their fourth gain in five session on Wednesday as investors again bet on a swift economic recovery from coronavirus-driven lockdowns and the potential for more stimulus measures from the Federal Reserve.
The S&P 500 stands at a two-month high and was briefly above its 100-day moving average, a closely watched technical indicator that has acted as a resistance level. The Nasdaq was trading at its highest level in three months and was about 5% below record levels, as shares of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) surged to all-time highs.
Gains were broad-based, with each of the 11 major S&P sectors on the plus side. The small-cap Russell 2000 index, which usually leads gains out of a recession, outperformed the large-cap indexes.
Still, with economic data likely to be dismal in the coming weeks, there is concern that stocks may have gotten ahead of themselves, with the S&P up nearly 33% from its March 23 closing low. 
""Once the economy shut down, we had very little clarity with respect to numbers and measurements, the whole marketplace is sort of flying blind,"" said Mike Zigmont, head of trading at Harvest Volatility Management in New York. ""This market is swept up in a very powerful trend and along the way it is very confident in itself. There hasn’t been much doubt that we are over our skis."" 
Minutes from the Federal Reserve's most recent policy meeting showed the central bank pledged to act as appropriate to support the economy until it is on track to recovery, a sentiment that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has voiced in recent days. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 360.8 points, or 1.49%, to 24,567.66, the S&P 500 gained 47.95 points, or 1.64%, to 2,970.89, and the Nasdaq Composite added 174.88 points, or 1.9%, to 9,359.99.
Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives plan to vote again next week on giving small businesses more time to utilize their coronavirus aid under the Paycheck Protection Program, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Wednesday.
As states across the country begin to loosen restrictions, hopes for an economic rebound have grown. The NYSE Arca airlines index jumped 5.35% as Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL)'s chief executive officer said he was confident travel will return in the next 12 to 18 months. 
 Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) lost 2.86% after the big box retailer reported a 64% plunge in quarterly profit, as costs related to the coronavirus outbreak outweighed a surge in online sales.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.05-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.53-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 74 new highs and nine new lows.

1582,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 03:09PM ET</span>",Biggest Power Demand Plunge Since Great Depression Is Reshaping Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- The global plunge in electricity demand will drag on long after nations lift stay-at-home orders, leading to the biggest annual drop since the Great Depression and fundamentally reshaping power markets.
As economies struggle to recover, worldwide electricity consumption will decline 5% in 2020, the most in more than eight decades, according to the International Energy Agency. In the U.S. last week, government analysts projected the nation’s biggest drop on record. And in Europe, analysts say a full recovery could take years.
The prolonged slowdown will increase economic pressure on older, uneconomic power plants -- especially those that burn coal -- and help speed the transition toward cleaner and cheaper wind and solar. It will also contribute to the biggest annual decline in greenhouse gasses from energy ever recorded.
“This unprecedented drop in demand is foreshadowing the grid of the future,” said Steve Cicala, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. The world is “getting an early look at what high penetrations of renewables will do.”
Part of the reason electricity consumption will not immediately bounce back when lockdowns end is that power demand largely mirrors economic activity. So generating plants won’t need to run at full tilt again until employment completely rebounds and factories operate at the same rate as before the virus.
Even then, some sectors could lag for years. Demand from office buildings, for example, could be permanently depressed as companies allow people to continue working from home. Already, Twitter has told workers they can telecommute indefinitely, and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. expects to keep its offices just half full for the “foreseeable future,” according to an internal memo seen by Bloomberg.Read More:  JPMorgan Expects to Keep Offices Half Full After Lockdown EndsLower demand is pitting generators against each other in a fight to produce the cheapest power possible. Wind and solar farms have an upper hand in many regions because they don’t need to buy fuel. Natural gas, which is trading near historic lows, remains competitive. Coal power, which is more expensive, is shouldering the majority of the cuts as generators scale back.
“Renewables will be the biggest beneficiaries,” said Joshua Rhodes, a research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute.As coal and oil use ebb, energy emissions are set to drop by a record 8% this year, according to the IEA. 
While wind and solar are producing a larger share of power, they’re not unscathed. Power auctions are being suspended in France, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, sapping the need for additional clean-energy projects. For the first time in two decades, the number of new wind and solar farms globally is set to decline this year, the IEA said in a report Wednesday.Read More:  Renewable Power Heads for Its First Decline in Two Decades
Some of the steepest drops in electricity consumption will be in Europe, where 2020 demand is forecast to fall 8%, according to the IEA.  In Germany, companies including RWE AG (OTC:RWEOY) and Uniper SE (OTC:UNPRF) are running coal generators less and relying more on gas plants. Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF) warned low demand will mean output from its nuclear reactors will fall by more than a fifth this year.
A similar dynamic is playing out in the U.S. retail power sales across the 50 states will sink 4.5% this year, the most since the U.S. Energy Information Administration began keeping records in 1949. Coal is on pace for the first time ever to produce less electricity nationwide than renewable energy. 
In Asia, power consumption is forecast to rebound faster. Nations where industrial production accounts for a large chunk of the economy, such as China and India, also had some of the strictest lockdowns -- a combination that hammered demand, according to BloombergNEF analyst Ali Asghar. While the IEA sees demand in China, the world’s top energy user, falling this year, official estimates put consumption in May already above last year’s levels and on course to grow as much as 3% in 2020.
Eventually, global demand for power will resume growing as nations turn more to electricity to power cars, heat homes and more, analysts said. But for now, the power sector faces a long, slow recovery.
“I don’t think we are going to turn everything on tomorrow,”  Melissa Lott, a senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “I don’t see how that happens.”Michael Bloomberg, the founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, has committed $500 million to launch Beyond Carbon, a campaign aimed at closing the remaining coal-powered plants in the U.S. by 2030 and slowing the construction of new gas plants.

1583,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 03:09PM ET</span>",Senate Passes Bill to Delist Chinese Companies From Exchanges,"(Bloomberg) -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved legislation Wednesday that could lead to Chinese companies such as  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). being barred from listing on U.S. stock exchanges amid increasingly tense relations between the world’s two largest economies.
The bill, introduced by Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, and Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, was approved by unanimous consent and would require companies to certify that they are not under the control of a foreign government.
If a company can’t show that it is not under such control or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board isn’t able to audit the company for three consecutive years to determine that it is not under the control of a foreign government, the company’s securities would be banned from the exchanges.
“I do not want to get into a new Cold War,” Kennedy said on the Senate floor, adding that he wants “China to play by the rules.”
So far, no companion measure has been introduced in the House of Representatives, according to a Senate aide familiar with the bill.
“Publicly listed companies should all be held to the same standards, and this bill makes common sense changes to level the playing field and give investors the transparency they need to make informed decisions,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “I’m proud that we were able to pass it today with overwhelming bipartisan support, and I urge our House colleagues to act quickly.”
The legislation -- S. 945 -- is another example of the rising bipartisan pushback against China in Congress that had been building over trade and other issues. It has been amplified especially by Republicans as President Donald Trump has sought to blame China as the main culprit in the coronavirus pandemic.
GOP lawmakers have in recent weeks unleashed a torrent of legislation aimed at punishing China for not being more forthcoming with information or proactive in restricting travel as the coronavirus began to spread from the Wuhan province, where it was first detected.
But the president’s focus on blaming China for the pandemic has threatened what had been a strong bipartisan consensus that the U.S. needs to get tougher on the country. Some Democrats have begun to shy away from initiatives that could be seen as further politicizing the issue as the U.S. heads toward November’s presidential election.
Kennedy told Fox Business on Tuesday that the bill would apply to U.S. exchanges such as NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.
“I would not turn my back on the Chinese Communist Party if they were two days dead,” Kennedy said. “They cheat. And I’ve got a bill to stop them from cheating.”
At issue is China’s longstanding refusal to allow the PCAOB to examine audits of firms whose shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and other U.S. platforms. The inspections by the little-known agency, which Congress stood up in 2002 in response to the massive Enron Corp. accounting scandal, are meant to prevent fraud and wrongdoing that could wipe out shareholders.
Since then China and the U.S. have been at odds on the issue even as companies including Alibaba and Baidu have raised billions of dollars selling shares in American markets. The long-simmering feud came to the forefront last year as Washington and Beijing clashed over broader trade and economic issues, and some in the White House have been urging Trump to take a harder line on the audit inspections.
Last week, Trump said in an interview on Fox Business that he’s “looking at” Chinese companies that trade on ⁦the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges but do not follow U.S. accounting rules. Still, he said that cracking down could backfire and simply result in the firms moving to exchanges in London or Hong Kong.
While not technically part of the government, the PCAOB is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The ability to inspect audits of Chinese firms that list in the U.S. is certain to come up at a roundtable that the SEC is holding on July 9 on risks of investing in China and other emerging markets.
Senators Kevin Cramer, Tom Cotton, Bob Menendez, Marco Rubio and Rick Scott are also sponsors of the bill. Rubio applauded the passage of the Kennedy-Van Hollen bill and said it incorporated aspects of a similar bill he introduced last year.
“I was proud to work with Senator Kennedy on this important legislation that would protect American retail investors and pensioners from risky investments in fraudulent, opaque Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges and trade on over-the-counter markets,” Rubio said in a statement. “If Chinese companies want access to the U.S. capital markets, they must comply with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability.”
According to the SEC, 224 U.S.-listed companies representing more than $1.8 trillion in combined market capitalization are located in countries where there are obstacles to PCAOB inspections of the kind this legislation mandates.

DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - The world's largest airliner, the Airbus (PA:AIR) A380, took a step closer to the aviation archives on Wednesday as Air France said it would permanently axe its grounded fleet and sources said Emirates was in talks to reduce remaining deliveries.
The superjumbo is close to the end of its production run after demand switched to smaller jets, and airlines including Air France (PA:AIRF) have been idling the double-decker temporarily because of the coronavirus crisis.
Air France announced a fresh 500 million euro ($548.50 million) writedown as it permanently retires its nine jets, just over a decade after becoming the first European airline to operate them.
Airbus last year announced plans to stop producing A380s in 2021 due to poor sales. It has nine left to build including eight for Emirates and one for Japan's ANA. 
Emirates no longer wants to take all eight A380s due to the pandemic and is in talks with Airbus, industry sources said.
Bloomberg earlier reported Emirates hoped to cancel five. 
Both Emirates and Airbus said they were in regular dialogue with each other, declining further comment.
Halting Emirates deliveries could be painful for both sides, with the airline foregoing deposits and Airbus left with parts already ordered and no significant market to dispose of them. 
Each A380 is worth some $200 million post-discounts, with virtually all represented by parts before assembly, suggesting an Airbus exposure of around $1.5 billion, market sources said.
Emirates has 50 A350s on order, the price of which could become a bargaining chip in discussions, one added.
Emirates is the biggest A380 operator with 115 and has said it expects to keep some into the 2030s. 
But the pandemic has forced belt-tightening worldwide and Emirates is considering retiring some A380s earlier than planned, sources said. 
One said Emirates was focused on reducing the number of leased A380s first.

(Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management (N:APO) said on Wednesday it has invested $1.75 billion in Albertsons Companies Inc, a sign of confidence in the debt-laden U.S. supermarket operator whose fortunes have picked up in the coronavirus outbreak.
The parent of grocery chains such as Safeway, Vons and Acme for years struggled to generate enough earnings growth to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) that would allow its owners, including private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, to cash out.
But the pandemic has fueled a boom in its business as consumers who stay at home buy more groceries. Albertsons said last month that its sales in March and most of April were up 34% from last year. 
The deal with Apollo values Albertsons at around $10 billion, excluding its $8.7 billion debt pile as of the end of February. It gives Albertsons more time and a valuation floor in its pursuit of an IPO, for which it has registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Apollo said it and a group of other investors acquired $1.75 billion of convertible preferred shares in Albertsons, representing a 17.5% stake in the company. 
""We believe the investment led by the Apollo funds represents a vote of confidence in both our business and our long-term strategy,"" Albertsons Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran said in a statement. 
Other supermarket operators, such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Target  Corp (N:TGT),  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST), have also seen a spike in sales as consumers stockpile essentials.

Albertsons has said it has hired more than 55,000 associates since the beginning of March to cope with demand, and the Boise, Idaho-based company temporarily increased pay for all front-line staff by $2 per hour. It also said it has seen a big jump in online grocery orders for home delivery.

Negotiations between the government in Vienna and Austrian Airlines (AUA) and Lufthansa management regarding a 767 million euro ($842 million) request for state aid were ongoing and are expected to continue over the weekend, a spokesman said on Wednesday. 
A decision regarding financial support from the German government for AUA parent Lufthansa is to be expected shortly, according to Chancellor Angela Merkel. 
Governments across the world are intervening to prop up airlines as estimated revenue losses from the coronavirus pandemic have climbed to $314 billion, according to the International Air Transport Association.
AUA said it would cancel all regular flights until June 14. The carrier hopes to resume flights within the German speaking region later that month before gradually expanding services to cities including Paris and London, and holiday destinations such as Greece in the summer holiday season, the spokesman said. 
AUA's on-board staff, around 3,800 of a total 7,000, have agreed to extend short-time work agreements until 2022 and afterwards accept socially staggered salary reductions of 5-15% until 2024, the spokesman said. Negotiations with ground staff were ongoing.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 02:21PM ET</span>",Lebanon seeks foreign government-backed financing for power plants after default,"By Tom Perry
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon has turned to global power plant manufacturers including  General Electric  (N:GE) to arrange financing to build badly needed electricity capacity, hoping favourable terms can be agreed with help from their governments.
Energy Minister Raymond Ghajar told Reuters on Wednesday that Lebanon had modified its approach to the process since it defaulted on its sovereign debt in March, meaning it was unable to offer the kind of sovereign guarantee sought by investors. 
""The default has caused a significant financability problem for infrastructure projects in Lebanon. That is why we are trying to meander around it,"" he said in an interview.
Beirut has said it plans to sign memorandums of understandings with  Siemens  AG (DE:SIEGn), General Electric, Mitsubishi (T:6503) and Ansaldo Energia - for negotiations to propose financially viable solutions for building the plants.
""We talked to the four companies ... they all expressed interest of their governments to finance such projects,"" Ghajar told Reuters. ""They are all willing to invest because now companies like these don't have a lot of work around the world.""
Fixing the loss-making power sector is seen as critical for the country which is mired in a financial crisis seen as the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war. 
Foreign donors see it as a test of Beirut's will to enact long-delayed reforms that may in turn help unlock their aid.
The companies would have conditions attached to their financing, which is expected to come from export credit agencies. ""Hopefully we can meet these conditions ... If they cannot be met we are back to square one,"" Ghajar said. 
Lebanon has set a six-month period for the negotiations.
EXPENSIVE GENERATORS 
The country has failed to provide 24-hour power since the war, leaving households reliant on expensive private generators.
More power cuts of late are linked to the crisis: Ghajar said two fuel shipments sitting off the coast had not been unloaded promptly as JP Morgan, the vendor's correspondent bank, had put a financial hold on Lebanese letters of credit.
The issue had now been resolved. 
The electricity company (EDL) has drained up to $2 billion a year from the public purse depending on oil prices.
The government has budgeted $1 billion for EDL this year, which Ghajar said would be enough due to low oil prices. 
But next year's amount - $500 million - would not, meaning the government needs to curb losses and improve collection rates on bills. If this was not enough, tariffs would need to be restructured, Ghajar said. 
Donors want a regulatory authority established as part of the reforms. The government is working on amendments to a law for establishing it, which parliament must then ratify.
Ghajar also said interest in Lebanon's second offshore oil and gas exploration licensing round, which closes on June 1, had not been very high. 

Most firms are not interested in exploration as budgets have been cut due to low oil prices and the new coronavirus, he said.

1593,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 02:19PM ET</span>",Illinois Moves Toward First Test of Fed’s Muni-Lending Lifeline,"(Bloomberg) -- Illinois may be one of the first -- and most high-profile -- governments to test the Federal Reserve’s $500 billion lending lifeline for states and cities.
The state is working on a so-called notice of interest that it will submit to the Fed, the first step toward borrowing from the central bank, said Carol Knowles (NYSE:KN), a spokesperson for the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget.
The move comes after Illinois postponed the planned auction of $1.2 billion short-term debt earlier this month as its bond yields surged amid concern about the financial hit it faces from the coronavirus shutdown.
States and local governments with weaker credit ratings like Illinois, the lowest-rated state, may be the ones that end up tapping the program because others can avoid the Fed’s penalties by borrowing at near-zero rates in the public markets. Borrowers also must try to secure loans from traditional lenders first, which could mean that highly-rated credits, won’t need to tap the Fed.
Borrowers with a BBB- rating face a 380 basis-point spread penalty on loans, according to the central bank. Even so,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). estimated in a report that Illinois could borrow at a rate that’s well below the “current market yield,” which is about 4.66% on 2-year debt, according to Bloomberg’s BVAL index.
Issuers have to submit a notice of interest to the Fed before submitting an application. BLX Group LLC, a subsidiary of law firm Orrick that the central bank hired for the municipal lending program, will review the notices of interest.
Before getting the loan from the Fed, the issuer must also provide a certification that it tried to “secure adequate credit accommodations.” Illinois’s short-term debt sale, initially expected May 6, was delayed as the state faced record-high penalties to borrow on Wall Street.
The lending program now allows the Fed to participate in a competitive bid process like Illinois requires, according to Knowles, the Illinois spokesperson. The state’s short-term certificates must be competitively bid, she said.
“We are continuing to monitor the municipal market and are prepared to enter at any time,” Knowles said in an email Wednesday, noting that the certificates are day-to-day status.
Illinois is eligible to borrow about $9.7 billion under the program, according to the New York Fed.
Kent Hiteshew, whom the Fed hired to help oversee the lending program, said at a virtual event this week that the central bank would move quickly to approve the notices of interest and applications for issuers that apply with straightforward debt offerings.
“We should begin purchasing notes in the very near future,” he said during the event.

1594,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>",First 20-Year Treasury Sale in a Generation Is Well-Received,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. government’s first 20-year bond sale since 1986 was awarded at a yield only slightly higher than where it was valued moments before the bidding deadline, and demand metrics suggested investors had no qualms about buying it.
The $20 billion auction was sold at 1.220%, less than a basis point above its when-issued yield of about 1.213% in the minute before the 1 p.m. New York-time bidding deadline. Primary dealers were awarded 24.6%, indirect bidders (a group that includes foreign central banks bidding via the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) took 60.7% and direct bidders 14.7%. The shares were comparable to those for last week’s 10-year and 30-year auctions.
The Treasury Department, which began mulling whether to add another long-maturity security to its product line shortly after President Donald Trump took office, settled on the 20-year in January after rejecting an ultra-long 50- or 100-year bond. At the time, it wasn’t clear that the new issue was immediately needed because the Fed -- in conjunction with its July interest-rate cut -- resumed reinvesting its maturing Treasuries, curtailing the amount that needed to be raised from private investors.
Then the coronavirus pandemic blew a massive hole in the federal budget, and the borrowing need skyrocketed. For the second quarter, Treasury estimated it will borrow $2.99 trillion. Three months earlier, the projection was close to zero.
While 20-year bonds routinely traded at higher yields than 30-year Treasuries before the government stopped selling them in the 1980s, the new one enjoys some advantages.
There’s little supply in that part of the curve to begin with, because the Treasury didn’t issue 30-year bonds from 2001 to 2006. And the Fed -- which has bought more than $1.5 trillion of Treasuries since mid-March to shore up financial markets -- owns as much as it is able to in nearly every bond in the sector.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) staff return to offices in regions slowly re-opening from the coronavirus lockdown, some may be required to sit at common desks, or ""hot desks,"" a temporary seating arrangement that management hopes will make it easier to clean, according to a memo seen by Reuters.
The memo, sent on Wednesday to staff in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said the bank has no timeline for returning staff to offices, but that it is working on a plan that will limit the number of staff in buildings to about 50% at any one time. A JPMorgan spokesman verified the contents of the memo. 
That puts JPMorgan's plans in line with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and other global banks, which are working out plans to return staff to offices while avoiding the kind of close social contact that could lead to a resurgence in the novel coronavirus. https://reut.rs/3fPAGsx
More than 90% of the JPMorgan's 250,000 employees worldwide have worked from home or other remote locations since mid-March to help stem the spread of the virus. That has proved disruptive, however, for some heavily regulated and technology-intensive jobs in trading and compliance.
In the memo, which was sent by JPMorgan's operating committee, the bank said that while the buildings are operating at reduced capacity, some staff will have to move to new desks or floors for ""flexible seating (that will allow) for all areas to be cleaned and disinfected effectively.""

In addition, the bank is removing furniture from office reception areas and limiting the number of people riding elevators at the same time. Cafeterias will sell only pre-packaged meals, cashiers will no longer accept cash and there will be fewer seats.

1604,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 12:27PM ET</span>",Flirting With Negative Rates Is Reality of a Zero-Bound World,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve appears to have succeeded in quashing bets on a future of negative interest rates in the U.S., only to see yet another benchmark rate dip below zero.
Hedges against a further rate cut disappeared from swaps and fed funds futures contracts this week, after a string of Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell himself, reiterated their aversion to a policy of negative interest rates. Then the benchmark for secured funding markets, the general-collateral rate, dropped below zero again Wednesday.
The Fed’s unlikely to sweat this drop, as technical factors are key to both the behavior of general collateral and the derivatives trades that showed up earlier this month. But it’s the reality of this world, with rates barely above zero in the U.S., that questions of whether and how key rates can remain positive are likely to keep popping up.
Speculation may get harder to dismiss, as negative rates are a live topic on the other side of the Atlantic. The European Central Bank is showing no signs of abandoning its policy, and the Bank of England is increasingly split on the issue, with Governor Andrew Bailey saying Wednesday that the central bank isn’t excluding the idea of taking borrowing costs below zero. The U.K. sold its first bond with a sub-zero yield Wednesday.
The drop in the U.S. overnight GC repo rate below zero may prove short-lived. These rates tend to slip as government-sponsored enterprises park cash for principal and interest payments in the repo market around mid-month, and that money typically exits the following week in distributions to mortgage-bond holders.
Strategists have attributed the positioning that popped up in futures for fed funds and overnight index swaps earlier this month to technical accounting issues. But their evaporation this week may mean that the market has heeded the Fed’s message that it’s not ready to embrace a policy that could harm savings, not to mention the $4 trillion money-market industry and bank profits.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",U.S. airlines step up safety measures in preparation for recovery,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - U.S. carriers JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp and United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc announced fresh safety measures on Wednesday aimed at restoring confidence in travel as several executives pointed to signs domestic demand is improving.
U.S. states are starting to reopen and airlines expect an increase in domestic travel over the extended holiday weekend for Memorial Day on May 25.
While data shows only a small fraction of recent flights were more than 70% full, there may soon be full or near-full planes, said Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. airlines.
The group launched a public awareness campaign called ""Fly Healthy. Fly Smart"" to reassure travelers on the industry's safety measures after a number of social media photos depicted packed flights. 
Major airlines have mandated face coverings for travelers and are taking a layered approach to safety.
JetBlue will continue blocking seats on its aircraft through at least July 6, check crew members' temperatures and step up aircraft cleaning with electrostatic aircraft fogging in June.
United will roll out Clorox (NYSE:CLX) Co's electrostatic sprayers and disinfecting wipes at its Chicago and Denver hub airports, followed by other locations. It will set up touchless kiosks and implement temperature checks for staff as well. 
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) will continue capping its passenger load at 60% beyond June, sources have told Reuters, and is undertaking other efforts to boost customer confidence as it adds flights back to its network.
Airlines have urged a standard set of safety rules across the industry, which is bleeding cash as the coronavirus crisis has decimated air travel demand.
Airlines are scouring customer research, visits to their websites and macroeconomic data to get a better picture of a rebound, JetBlue President and Chief Operating Officer Joanna Geraghty told Reuters.

United carried about 35,000 passengers daily last week, a jump from some days in mid-April when it flew fewer than 10,000, Kirby said.

Speaking in the Senate, he said the government was particularly concerned about maintaining the Flins plant, northwest of Paris.
At the end of May, Renault plans to outline 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) of spending cuts over the next three years after booking its first loss in a decade last year. 
French financial daily Les Echos has reported that Renault is considering closing three of its French sites, including an assembly plant in Dieppe, and that it would stop making cars in Flins.
Renault board chairman Jean-Dominique Senard and interim CEO Clotilde Delbos are set to meet with unions on Monday to discuss the plan, which was announced in February. 
At the time, Delbos said there would be no taboos, which led to union worries about job cuts. 
But with the French state as its largest shareholder and a five billion euro bank loan guaranteed by the state set to help it cope with the coronavirus outbreak, Renault has relatively limited scope for job cuts in France.

Total assets in BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond exchange-traded fund, ticker LQD, touched a record $46.7 billion on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to $28.2 billion on March 19, just days before the central bank said it would purchase investment-grade corporate bonds and certain ETFs that tracked them.
The Fed’s move spurred a rally in high-grade bond markets, where investors were shedding their holdings in an effort to raise cash amid dire economic data. The central bank’s pledge combined with the asset class’s strong fundamentals makes investment-grade bonds look appealing, according to Columbia Threadneedle’s Ed Al-Hussainy.
“Investment-grade credit is particularly attractive at the moment -- it captures large corporates with solid balance sheets and good access to market financing to weather this recession,” said Al-Hussainy, a senior strategist at the firm. “And of course, the asset class has an explicit Fed backstop.”
LQD has rallied since the Fed announced the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility on March 23, which kicked off its first purchases last week. Corporate-debt funds led the intake for fixed-income ETFs last week, with investment-grade funds posting inflows and high-yield funds seeing outflows.
The Fed’s touch has also been felt in the junk-bond market, with BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, ticker HYG, also hitting a record size of $21.7 billion this week. U.S. policy makers expanded the bond-buying program to include recently downgraded debt last month, though the “preponderance of ETF holdings” will be concentrated in funds tracking high-grade credit.
In addition to the Fed’s backstop, the economy’s reopening should benefit small-cap stocks and junk bonds, which tend to have weaker balance sheets, according to Academy Securities.
“For me, it’s all about the reopen and a ‘rotation’ from work-from-home,” said Peter Tchir, Academy’s head of macro strategy. “High-yield does well generally when small caps do, so the upside will be in high-yield and leveraged loans.”
But for Columbia’s Al-Hussainy, betting on junk bonds is still too risky of a proposition at this stage.
“Right now, I would say investment-grade offers best risk/reward as a bet on the Fed’s balance sheet,” Al-Hussainy said. “Equities and high-yield are a bet on the effectiveness of fiscal policy.”

Those steps have led to an “incredible amount of money around,” with “money-making opportunities for bankers,” Bove wrote in a note Wednesday. That contrasts with the likelihood of rising loan losses, capital issues and potential dividend cuts across banks, and makes JPMorgan an attractive investment, he said.
Bove also flagged the bank’s “startlingly strong” operating numbers in the past 60 days, with deposits data at the end of the first quarter indicating JPMorgan has 11% of the nation’s money supply deposited in its bank, while loans industrywide grew by $825 billion, or 8.2%, with about 89.7% of the new loans in the commercial and industrial sector, he said.
“The vast majority of the other banks in the country lack JPMorgan’s strengths and diversity and we remain cautious concerning their results,” Bove added.
JPMorgan rose as much as 4.2% Wednesday in New York. Other big banks climbed as well, with Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). advancing as much as 3.5% and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). as much as 4.2%. Stocks gained across the board as investors keyed in on signals the American economy will continue to reopen and retail earnings showed signs of resiliency.
JPMorgan and other banks have underperformed the broader market since Feb. 20, when concern about Covid-19 began accelerating. JPMorgan has tumbled 33% since then, versus a 12% decline for the S&P 500.

The EU is discussing how to strengthen its scrutiny of the financial sector after a spate of scandals in Estonia, Malta, Latvia, Cyprus and the Netherlands exposed how national watchdogs were slow at acting against banks who abetted or did not prevent money laundering.
EU Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis, a former premier of Latvia, has refrained from proposing legislative changes but earlier in May reiterated possible options to clamp down on financial crime, including the transfer of monitoring powers from national watchdogs to an EU-wide body.
At a closed-door videoconference of EU finance ministers on Tuesday, Estonia, Hungary and the Czech Republic opposed the plan, according to three officials who attended the online meeting. They did not say what reasons the three countries gave for their opposition.
Estonia has been at the centre of Europe's worst money-laundering scandal since media reports in 2017 triggered investigations into 200 billion euros ($220 billion) in suspicious payments made through  Danske Bank 's (CO:DANSKE) tiny Estonian branch between 2007 and 2015.
That amounted to around 10 times Estonia's annual economic output. A government official said Estonia has not yet decided whether to support an EU supervisory body.
Officials from Hungary and the Czech Republic were not immediately available. Both countries have faced inquiries into their use of EU funds, after EU auditing and investigative bodies found serious irregularities.
Officials who attended the finance ministers' videoconference said the plan was also opposed by Malta, whose top lender, Bank of Valletta, has been under close EU scrutiny for flaws in its money-laundering screening. 

Maltese officials denied being in opposition, saying the country supports publicly and privately EU plans for joint supervision of financial crime.

(Reuters) - A surge in  Target  Corp's (N:TGT) online sales due to panic buying during the coronavirus crisis helped the big-box retailer post better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, even as it grappled with soaring operational costs.
Target, like Walmart (N:WMT), benefited from customers stockpiling staples and cleaning products at the start of the quarter, while demand for non-staple items like beauty products, home goods and clothes rose as stimulus checks arrived late in April.
Although U.S. grocers and supermarket chains have seen a monumental surge in sales during the quarter, they have little to show in terms of profit as most of their funds were spent on bonuses and overtime payments to keep stores running during the pandemic.
""Last quarter was unlike anything I've ever seen,"" Target's Chief Executive Officer Brian Cornell told reporters. ""It was intense, it was volatile, it was stressful for our guests and the country.""
Overall, online comparable sales jumped 141%, benefiting from investments in same-day delivery services such as in-store pick up, Drive-up and Shipt, and accounted for almost all of its same-store sales growth for the first quarter ended May 2.
Net profit, however, fell 64.3% in the quarter as operating costs rose 11%. 
Target, which has already pulled its financial targets for the year, is setting aside nearly $500 million to spend on maintaining safety standards at stores and pay employees higher wages.
""There's just so much uncertainty as I think about the balance of the year ... Obviously we're watching closely to see what happens from an economic standpoint,"" Cornell said.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 59 cents per share, beating already lowered expectations of 40 cents.

""Target is prioritizing being open for customers ... This strategy makes sense, although near term results are likely to remain volatile,"" Evercore ISI analyst Greg Melich said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Affirma Capital, run by former Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) bankers, has hired JP Morgan (N:JPM) to advise on the sale of the private equity firm's minority stake in a Jordanian agricultural and food processing company, two sources told Reuters.
Bidders for the stake in Al Jazeera Agriculture Company include ADQ, formerly known as Abu Dhabi Development Holding and based in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, the sources said, adding ADQ was being advised by Rothschild & Co (PA:ROTH).
The UAE, which depends on imports for 80%-90% of its food, introduced a law in March to organize strategic food stocks for emergencies, the state news agency WAM reported, amid growing food security concerns due to the coronavirus crisis.
Al Jazeera's main products include fresh and frozen chicken for retail and wholesale, eggs, chicks and chicken feed, its website says.
The sources did not give a value for Al Jazeera but said it had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about $40 million a year.
Based on typical valuation multiples of 8 to 12 times EBITDA, the Jordanian firm could be worth in excess of $320 million. However, the coronavirus crisis has caused turmoil in financial markets, hammering corporate valuations.
The sources said the crisis had slowed the sale but bidders were still active.
The sources did not quantify the stake held by Affirma, which now has $3.6 billion of assets under management after it was carved out from Standard Chartered Private Equity.
Standard Chartered Private Equity bought what it described as a ""significant minority stake"" in Al Jazeera in 2014 for $35 million.
Affirma Capital did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Rothschild and JP Morgan declined to comment. Al Jazeera and ADQ were not immediately available for comment.
ADQ controls several government companies, such as the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, and is led Mohamed Hassan AlSuwaidi, a former executive at Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Investment Company.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>",U.S. regulator changes penalty guidelines as it pursues more sophisticated misconduct,"By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. derivatives regulator is updating how it assesses penalties for the first time in decades as it pursues more sophisticated forms of misconduct, including fraud, futures manipulation, and rate-rigging, it said on Wednesday.
Congress dramatically expanded the remit of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) following the 2008 financial crisis, but the agency has not formally updated its guidelines on fines for banks, dealers and other trading firms since 1994. 
The new framework underscores the agency's growing focus on pursuing complex systemic misconduct across institutions and markets, in contrast to one-off boiler room scams and rogue traders which had once been its focus.
""An awful lot has changed since 1994 inside the agency and we thought we needed to provide some additional guidance on how we do things, in particular as we continue to grow into our jurisdiction,” CFTC enforcement director James McDonald told Reuters. 
The CFTC said it will consider a range of factors when assessing penalties. These include: the gravity and pervasiveness of the misconduct, whether the company concealed or obstructed an investigation, the robustness of its compliance program, the responsibility of management and the timeliness of remediation.
McDonald said the new guidance would not necessarily mean higher penalties. Rather, he hoped greater transparency over how the agency assesses penalties would encourage companies to boost internal controls and help deter wrongdoing.
""We're imposing significant fines routinely in the eight figures. That's a pretty significant difference from pre-Dodd Frank (Act),"" he said, referring to 2010's Wall Street reform.
In 2017, McDonald launched a program encouraging companies and individuals to self-report wrongdoing and cooperate with investigators in exchange for lower penalties.

The CFTC has recently upped its collaboration with criminal prosecutors, raising the stakes for bad actors. In fiscal 2019, the CFTC filed a record 16 cases in parallel with criminal authorities, according to its annual report.

1626,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",A $150 Billion Pile of Frozen Loans Starts to Worry U.S. Banks,"(Bloomberg) -- Millions of Americans getting breaks on their loans are about to hear from their banks.
Nationwide, lenders are preparing to take a closer look at consumers who have arranged to delay payments, potentially pushing some out of the programs, as the industry tries to get a clearer picture of how many customers are truly unable to keep up during the coronavirus pandemic.
Forbearance programs from March are nearing expiration dates, when many banks are set to decide whether to continue letting people put off roughly $150 billion of debt including credit cards balances, personal loans and car payments. In interviews, executives said they’re concerned that at least some borrowers sought relief unnecessarily and that they should be coaxed into paying. A number of firms aim to whittle out such participants, or charge interest to continue.
“I would imagine we may have to go beyond 90 days” of forbearance, Southern Bancorp (NASDAQ:TBBK) Inc. Chief Executive Officer Darrin Williams (NYSE:WMB) said in an interview, referring to the expiration date for many programs. “I feel pretty strongly that many of the folks who took advantage of the consumer payment holiday we provided probably didn’t have to. But if it’s offered, why not, right?”
The rapid rollout of forbearance programs in March averted financial ruin for millions of households, giving Congress time to bolster unemployment benefits and offer emergency aid to businesses. The goal was to avoid a tidal wave of defaults by borrowers who began losing income when states locked down commerce to slow infections. More than 30 million people have since filed jobless claims.
But many lenders offered to postpone bills with no proof of hardship, and many borrowers kept working. Some signed up for the programs as a precaution, taking a break from payments to shore up their savings. That’s made it impossible for banks to gauge the degree to which their loan portfolios are at risk of going bad.
Some mid-sized banks placed more than 15% of their loan books into forbearance by the end of March, Janney Montgomery Scott analysts wrote in a report last week. In regions like the U.S. Southeast, relatively high rates of borrower relief contrasted with low infection rates at the time. Many programs have remained open since then, continuing to take on borrowers who have fallen on hard times.
On average, banks had about 5% of their consumer loan portfolios on ice as of mid- to late-April, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote in a report this month that compiled disclosures from about 80 large, regional and community banks. Based on Federal Reserve data, that would equate to roughly $150 billion in loans -- though the amount may have climbed since then.
Those figures don’t include U.S. mortgage forbearance programs that let borrowers with government-backed loans postpone payments for as long as 12 months while dealing with the pandemic.
The consumer-loan deferrals have left banks, shareholders and even regulators in the dark on how many people are truly in distress and what the ultimate cost to lenders may be. Some executives expect to get a clearer view of the situation in the second half of the year.
For now, regulators are letting banks put off that reckoning. In March, a bevy of watchdogs made it easier for lenders to modify terms, such as by lowering interest rates or letting borrowers skip payments. The moves wouldn’t necessarily require banks to label those situations as “troubled debt restructurings,” which require more capital.
“My belief is losses aren’t coming until third quarter for banks,” Ira Robbins, CEO of  Valley National Bancorp  (NASDAQ:VLY), said in an interview. Because banks granted deferrals to pretty much everyone who asked for it, “we have no idea, outside of hypothesis, as to what’s going to happen from a credit perspective.”
Banks are now examining millions of account holders to determine who is taking advantage of the programs. The efforts include trying to figure out which customers still have jobs by checking databases operated by major credit reporting firms.
In a more innovative approach, some lenders are hoping to reverse the flow of information that’s flooded from banks to financial technology ventures in recent years. Aggregators such as Plaid and Envestnet (NYSE:ENV) Inc.’s Yodlee have been collecting account data and providing it to apps that offer help with personal finances or investments. Now, banks are hoping to tap into that information to glean a more complete view of their own customers’ finances, such as their balances at other banks.
“We’ve heard from some banks about their interest in using Plaid products for forbearance relief and are working with them to see if it can be used,” said John Pitts, head of policy at Plaid, which recently created a platform that makes it easier for banks to share their data with outside apps.
Some banks are considering letting customers continue skipping payments but reinstating interest on loans, a move that could make forbearance less enticing for those who don’t absolutely need it. Others might require customers to show additional proof they’ve been impacted by the virus.
“The banks want to genuinely help,” said Scott Barton, managing partner at 2nd Order Solutions, which advises lenders on collections and forbearance processes. But they “would like to start to differentiate and not give away money to people that don’t really need it right now.”
Forbearance deadlines vary by bank and customer.  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). was one of the first banks to offer forbearance, initially granting a 30-day reprieve that it since extended twice until May 31.
Generally, the nation’s largest banks -- also including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. -- have said they will at least check in with borrowers in coming weeks as they assess how to continue programs and whether to encourage people to use other options. Those can include modifying loans or restarting some payments for credit cards or car loans.
So far, the programs seem to be easing financial strains during the pandemic. Fewer households were late on their cards, car loans, personal loans and mortgages in April than in March, according to  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU) data released Wednesday. That upended expectations that consumers would fall behind on their debts as a result of widespread joblessness and the forced shutdown of the U.S. economy.
Matt Komos, TransUnion’s vice president of research and consulting, said households may be postponing payments to keep an extra cash cushion just in case the economy worsens. Indeed, many consumers who deferred loans sent payments anyway, sometimes far more than the monthly minimums to reduce their overall debt loads, TransUnion data show. At Bank of America, about a third of people who asked to delay credit-card bills ended up paying, CEO Brian Moynihan said Tuesday on Bloomberg Television.
“A lot of the banks are in the dark a little bit in terms of how to treat customers,” said Alan McIntyre, senior managing director for Accenture (NYSE:ACN) Plc’s banking practice. “The measures they focus on to manage credit quality -- those dials aren’t moving. And those dials aren’t going to move until the fall.”

1628,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2020 09:38AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Higher on Recovery Hopes,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher again on Wednesday, regaining their poise after a late stumble on Tuesday caused by a cold shower on the prospects of a cure for the Covid-19 virus. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 299 points or 1.2% at 24,506 points. The S&P 500 was up 1.3% while the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.5%.
The move comes after President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin both talked up the prospects of a strong bounce-back for the economy in the third quarter, amid increasing signs of economic reopening across the country ahead of the Memorial Day weekend. Investors found such comments fresher on Tuesday than those of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who warned for the third time in a week that the economy could well need further support measures.
Among the biggest early gainers was Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) stock, which gained another 4.1% after the social media company received positive reviews for its decision to get back into online shopping, which it announced on Tuesday. 
Facebook Shops will be aimed primarily at small businesses and will be rolled out first on the Facebook and Instagram apps, and subsequently on the Whatsapp and Messenger messaging apps.
Another early riser was biotech company Inovio (NASDAQ:INO), which reported positive results on animals in preclinical trials for its flagship initiative to find a vaccine for Covid-19.  Inovio stock has been susceptible to violent spikes on the back of previous announcements that have quickly receded.
Meanwhile, Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock was down another 1.8% after the health website Stat cited experts as saying that the selective test results it published for its experimental vaccine had too little data to be a reliable guide to its effectiveness.
The coronavirus pandemic also had a positive effect on sales at home improvement store Lowe's. Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) stock rose 2.0%, paring premarket gains, after the company reported stronger-than-expected numbers for its fiscal first quarter, with a 33% beat on the bottom line that may have come at the expense of future quarters.  Target  (NYSE:TGT) stock fell 0.9% after the big box retailer also reported a strong increase in sales but a concurrent increase in operating costs.
Elsewhere, {{|U.S. crude}} oil prices extended their recent gains, rising 5.2% to a new two-month high of $33.62 a barrel on confidence of a pickup in demand. Gold Futures also rose 0.5% to $1,753 an ounce, on course for their highest close in eight years.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>",Unions say Ryanair exaggerating COVID threat to undermine conditions,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Several Ryanair trade unions say they will resist an attempt to cut pay and conditions for a five-year period, citing management promises of a swift recovery from the coronavirus crisis and the fact its CEO has committed to a pay cut for just one year.
Europe's largest low-cost airline plans to cut 3,000 pilots and cabin crew and reduce pay by up to 20% to deal with the crisis which has grounded almost all of its flights until July.
In a letter sent by the airline to several unions, seen by Reuters, Ryanair (I:RYA) said it was in a ""battle for long-term survival.""
But unions in key markets, including Ireland, Britain, Spain, Italy and Belgium, told members the measures contradicted guidance to investors.
Ryanair said on Monday it saw ""significant opportunities"" from the crisis and forecast it would ""emerge stronger"". CEO Michael O'Leary said he hoped 2019 passenger levels would return in 2021, with ticket prices recovering in 2022.
""These statements do not come from an airline that is fighting for its survival,"" the Belgian Cockpit Association said. Ryanair will ""likely be one of the big winners of the after-crisis,"" a memo to members said.
British union BALPA accused Ryanair in a memo of taking advantage of the crisis ""to lower long-term costs irrespective of when the pandemic is over.""
Several unions said they wanted guarantees that if they accept pay cuts, redundancies would be avoided. The Belgian union called for Ryanair to cut hours for all pilots to avoid the job losses.
Eddie Wilson, chief executive of Ryanair DAC, Ryanair's main airline unit, said there were signs of ""blind optimism"" from unions, which he said did not understand Ryanair had to be prudent as it had no one to bail it out if the situation deteriorated.

He said unions had yet to make a counter offer to the five-year pay proposal. He said the negotiation process was not over, but would have to be completed in the coming weeks.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>",Nestle to build new plant-based food facility in China under $100 million investment plan,"(Reuters) - Food giant Nestle (S:NESN) said on Wednesday it would spend 100 million swiss francs ($103.58 million) on expanding its manufacturing footprint in China to include a new plant-based food facility and widen its production lines. 
The company said its first plant-based food facility for Asia would be built in Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) and that it could launch faux meat products by the end of this year.
Chinese consumers have been steadily shifting to plant-based diets over the past few years, in part due to a devastating pig disease and bruising Sino-U.S. trade war driving up meat prices. And now with the coronavirus crisis, several consumers are also rethinking their diets.
China's ""free from meat"" market, which includes alternative meat products, grew 33.5% since 2014 to be worth just under $10 billion in 2018, according to Euromonitor. It predicts that the industry will be worth $11.9 billion by 2023. 
The Nescafe coffee maker said the investment in TEDA would also include a significant capacity expansion of Nestle's existing Purina pet food plant, with new production lines offering consumers premium veterinary diet and wet cat food products.
The company, which has 31 production sites in China, also said it would increase annual production capacity of a local biscuit wafer plant.
Nestle's proposed investment comes just a few weeks after U.S. agribusiness giant Cargill (CARG.UL) said it would introduce a range of plant-based meat products in China following a successful trial of faux meat nuggets by KFC-owner Yum China Holdings (N:YUMC).

Luckin Coffee said on Tuesday that Nasdaq had notified the company of plans to delist it from the U.S. stock exchange, a month after the company disclosed that some employees had fabricated sales accounts.
The coffee chain's stock, which has lost more than 90% of its value this year, fell to a low of $2.69 in premarket trade on Wednesday, a far cry from its peak of $51.38 in January. 
Nasdaq's notice comes as the exchange renews its focus on auditing standards. This week it tightened listings rules, hoping to curb initial public offerings of Chinese companies closely held by insiders and opaque about accounting, Reuters reported.
In its delisting notice, the bourse cited public interest concerns raised by the fabricated transactions and Luckin's failure to disclose material information.
""The type of scandal in our opinion is too severe to allow the company to be listed on the U.S. stock market,"" Zephirin Group analyst Lenny Zephirin told Reuters.

Luckin, a rival to Starbucks (O:SBUX) in China, plans to challenge the move before a Nasdaq hearing panel, and will remain listed until the outcome, which is most likely within two months.

The U.S. motorcycle maker, which closed its U.S. plants in March due to the coronavirus outbreak, may not ship any additional new motorcycles this year to about 70% of its 698 dealers in the country, the report said.
The company did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.
Harley would reopen its plants in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and accelerate production in phases that would be limited to bestselling models and palette of colors and without customizable features for the rest of the year, the report said.
The company has failed for years to increase sales in the United States, its top market which accounts for more than half its motorcycles sold. 
As its tattooed, baby-boomer consumer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company has found it tough to attract new customers. To make matters worse, the pandemic has further dented demand as Americans stay at home.
In April, then acting Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz, who has since taken a permanent role at Harley, told investors about plans to cut costs and ""de-emphasize"" some of its unprofitable international regions.
Jochen and team have been working on a new five-year strategic plan https://investor.harley-davidson.com/news-releases/news-release-details/harley-davidson-announces-first-quarter-2020-results-covid-19 to revive sales, which the company plans to reveal in the second-quarter earnings update.
Harley has also moved the launch timing of new models to the early part of the first quarter from August to better align with the start of the riding season. That provided some boost to its U.S. retail sales in the first quarter.
Harley's annual dealer meet, usually held in August, will now take place early next year.

CEO Herbert Diess and non-executive Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch were accused of stock market manipulation for a delay in informing investors about the diesel scandal when it first came to light in 2015, and were each fined 4.5 million euros.
VW in September 2015 admitted using illegal software to cheat U.S. diesel engine tests, battering its share price.
Volkswagen already announced on Tuesday it was paying the fines for Diess and Poetsch, who in 2015 held positions as the head of VW brand and finance chief, respectively, as they did not violate any laws or their fiduciary duties toward VW.
The court said the case against Martin Winterkorn, who was CEO at the time of the scandal, is still pending on charges of fraud and other offences.

The scandal over engine control devices that mask excessive nitrogen oxide emissions has so far cost Volkswagen more than 30 billion euros in damages and regulatory fines, mainly imposed in the United States.

Launched a decade ago in Mumbai, Ola has been fighting for dominance with Uber (N:UBER) in dozens of Indian cities. It also has operations in Australia, New Zealand and the UK, partnering with around 2.5 million drivers. 
Both ride-hailing companies have been hammered by a two-month-long lockdown that has kept 1.3 billion Indians indoors and halted app-based cabs and rickshaws. Local media reports said Uber has cut 700 of its estimated 2,000-2,500 employees.
The U.S. firm, which has sold both its Chinese and South-East Asia businesses to local rivals, on Monday made more job cuts that meant it has reduced staffing by more than a third globally since the start of the crisis.
Uber declined to say whether it has cut jobs in India.
""The prognosis ahead for our business is very unclear and uncertain. It is going to take a long time for people to go out and about like before,"" Bhavish Aggarwal, Ola's co-founder and CEO, said in a note to employees on the company's blog. 
Sources at SoftBank's Vision Fund, which holds stakes in both Uber and Ola, said it previously considered pushing for a merger of the two companies, but abandoned the idea due to concerns it would create a monopoly and be vetoed by regulators. 
Ola joins a list of local start-ups, including the local franchise of another SoftBank-backed (T:9984) venture, WeWork, restaurant aggregator Zomato and food delivery service Swiggy that have laid off employees in recent weeks.

Analysts say many were ripe for stripping down after feasting on a boom in private equity funding seeking to cash in on India's growing middle class and fast-growing cities.

His announcement, made to shareholders at the bank's annual general meeting on Wednesday, was the first time he has publicly said he would not seek a third five-year term.
Achleitner, one of Europe's most prominent bankers, has faced criticism from some shareholders for the bank's strategy zig-zags, management upheaval, and an 80% share price decline over the past decade. 
In an effort to reverse five years of losses, Deutsche Bank is currently undergoing a major overhaul that includes streamlining its investment bank and cutting 18,000 jobs globally. The coronavirus crisis has upended its operations and cast doubt on its profit goals.
""I won't seek re-election. After 10 years in this role, it has to be enough,"" Achleitner said.
Glass Lewis, a leading shareholder advisory group, has called on investors to vote against ratifying the chairman's actions for the past year at the shareholder meeting, citing ""performance"" concerns.
Achleitner also faces for a third year in a row a vote to remove him from his post, a process he survived by a wide margin in past years.
A former partner of Goldman Sachs (N:GS) and finance chief for Allianz (DE:ALVG), Achleitner has been in search of a successor, people with direct knowledge of the matter have said.
The bank's supervisory board has recently expressed continued support for him.
Separately, Deutsche's chief executive Christian Sewing dismissed shareholder concerns the bank would need state aid to cope with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. 

He said the bank needed to become more profitable before taking a leading role in European banking consolidation.

CEO Edward Bastian told Fox Business Network the airline's 60% cap on passenger load would help it maintain social distancing, while it also undertakes other efforts such as cleaning to boost customer confidence. 
""Today our load factor on Delta is somewhere about 35-40% full,"" he said in an interview. ""Once we get close to 60% on an individual route that'll be the trigger for us to add more planes into the system.""
Bastian said he expected to add about 200 flights in June, and probably another 200 or 300 flights in July. 
Overall, U.S. travel continues to be ""slow,"" he said, adding that he expects it to recover in the next 12 to 18 months, although international travel may not restart more fully until 2021.
He said he expects the company's costs to be down more than 50% in the second quarter on year-over-year basis, and that with the help of U.S. government assistance he sees ending June with a $14 billion cash balance to help the airline ride out the pandemic.

Sources familiar with the airline's strategy had told Reuters Delta's plan to limit passengers to 60% of its seats was key to its efforts to manage fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

1637,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>","For Creators of Giant Oil ETF, Troubles in Market Began a Decade Ago","(Bloomberg) -- For ordinary investors, it was perhaps the most spectacular demonstration of the unique perils of trying to wager on the price of oil.
Last month, the mighty United States Oil Fund, a popular ETF tracking crude, became unmoored as prices fell to unthinkable levels. Leading up the crash, the fund, known by its ticker USO (NYSE:USO), alone held a quarter of all the soon-to-expire oil contracts in the futures market, alarming regulators and sparking accusations it exacerbated oil’s plunge below zero.
Did USO actually help break the oil market? That we may never truly know. But the episode marked a stunning turning point, not only for the 14-year-old fund, but also commodity ETFs as a whole. Critics say the debacle has thrown into stark relief questions — some of which were foreshadowed by events a decade ago — about what these exchange-traded funds actually track, if they’re more active than passive, and whether ETFs built around complex derivatives tied to a market as convoluted as oil can be viable for mom and pop investors.
“It’s not just the construction of USO, it’s the ecosystem that allows a product like this to be listed and traded on an exchange,” said Reggie Browne, principal at GTS, a market-making firm.
Granted, just about anyone speculating on a rise in oil prices got hammered. There are plenty of reasons, unrelated to USO, for why oil fell as far as it did. And USO’s scheduled moves to switch out of expiring contracts over a week before oil crashed below zero kept losses for its holders — which totaled a staggering 75% from March through April alone — from getting even worse.
But extraordinary buying and selling by the fund, one of the biggest players in oil futures, suggests USO may have gotten too big for its own — not to mention the market’s — good. And that may have turned the fund into something more than the simple oil-tracking ETF that ordinary investors bargained for.
In some ways, those worries have a decade in the making.
In 2009, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission probed USO over large swings in oil prices and concluded the ETF’s futures broker failed to properly disclose certain trades and that the United States Commodity Funds, which manages USO and other commodity ETFs, could be liable. The firm disputed CFTC’s findings. And a year before, USCF ran into issues with the CFTC over the size of its natural gas positions.
The CFTC’s attempts to police excessive speculation have long faced stiff opposition from a powerful coalition of financial, energy and agricultural firms. This month, the regulator held another hearing on position limits in the market, but little has been done by regulators or the exchanges over the years to address USO’s popularity with individual investors or its outsize influence in the oil futures market.
Unenviable Position
Those factors came into full view in recent months. The collapse of demand wrought by the coronavirus, and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, sent oil prices down over 66% in the first quarter. All the while, individuals plowed billions of dollars into USO and other oil ETFs, eyeing a rebound.
The selloff prompted many ETFs, including USO, to dump their nearer-dated futures contracts to mitigate losses and move into positions that come due later in the year. (Unlike financial assets, the price of commodities like oil are typically benchmarked to the most actively traded futures contract, which is usually the one closest to expiring.) Some say those moves, some of which were made at the request of listing venues like CME, accelerated losses and triggered a feedback loop that sent prices tumbling.
On April 20, one day before the May contract on West Texas Intermediate futures expired, the U.S. benchmark settled at -$37.63 a barrel.
This posed a problem. In a world where sub-zero oil prices are possible, passive ETFs designed to track those prices found themselves in an unenviable position: transform themselves in active funds or go negative and liquidate.
Some were forced to choose the latter. WisdomTree — which shuttered a number of leveraged oil ETFs — explained its decision by saying that if the market moves against you “and you’ve got 3x leverage, the fund is over.”
USO, like many others, effectively turned itself into the former. Its manager said that while it expects the ETF to return to investing in the front-month contract at some point in the future, there is “no guarantee of when, if ever, that will occur.” Investors should expect “continued deviations” in USO’s performance because it won’t be able to track the price of oil properly.
“In some ways, USO has morphed into an active fund, maybe even a hedge fund,” said Eric Balchunas, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “They’ve abandoned their mission. But, these are wartime decisions. If you are on the front line when a war breaks out, sometimes your protocols go out the window. Your portfolio has to survive.”
John Love, USCF’s chief executive, said he couldn’t comment on anything beyond public disclosures. He said investing in USO “involves risks similar to those involved with an investment directly in the oil market, the correlation risk described in the prospectus, and other significant risks.”
Since debuting in 2006, USO has been a popular choice among individuals, who have few avenues to wager on the direction of oil prices. The retail boom fanned concern the ETF’s fan base didn’t understand the nuances of USO, which has attracted $6 billion in inflows this year.
Far from a straightforward bet on oil prices, investors not only have to contend with costs incurred from rolling over derivatives when longer-dated contracts cost more, but also the fact that those who hold futures until expiration must take delivery of the actual commodity — whether it’s oil, corn or hogs.
It was fear of getting stuck with physical barrels of oil and no where to store them that led speculators to pay to unload their futures. Hence negative prices.
CME Chief Executive Terry Duffy told CNBC on April 22 his exchange caters to “professional participants” and doesn’t target “small retail investors.”
But the commodity ETFs, which trade on the CME and behave like stocks, are arguably built for just such ordinary investors: A low-fee, tax-efficient way to gain access to markets historically out of reach. That unfettered access was bound to create problems, says Greenwich Associates’ Ken Monahan. One issue is the cost of perpetually switching out of expiring contracts.
Bled Out
“For years, nobody cared that these futures-based ETFs constantly bled out,” said Monahan, a senior analyst covering market structure and technology. “For me, it’s kind of mind-blowing that this is marketed as a retail product.”
John Hyland, who oversaw the launch of USO during his tenure as USCF’s chief investment officer, says he’s heard it all before. Same accusations about USO’s size and influence when oil prices doubled to $140 a barrel between 2007 and 2008, and the same worries about individuals getting in over their heads.
According to Hyland, USO was actually a net seller of oil futures during the run-up. He also said that because USO’s roll — when it switches over to the following month’s futures contract — is spread out over a number of days, concerns about its impact are overblown. Hyland considers its recent moves little more than “portfolio drift.” The controversy will eventually blow over and the ETF will once again return to tracking front-month contracts.
Regardless, it’s possible the Securities and Exchange Commission is already looking into it, says Jeremy Senderowicz, a partner at law firm Dechert LLP.
The SEC, which regulates equity markets, said in early April it was stepping up scrutiny of leveraged ETFs after getting numerous complaints from individuals. That could now extend to USO after what happened last month. The SEC declined to comment.
“Any time any publicly listed issuer blows up, the SEC is always on the case,” Senderowicz said. “They’re very sensitive to anything that touches retail investors.”

Online sales for Lowe's surged 80% in the quarter, after the company limited operating hours and implemented social distancing measures at its stores to minimize the risk of the virus spreading. Analysts at Wedbush on Home Depot's profit miss said the company was restricting traffic at its stores more than Lowe's and that Home Depot's business is also more reliant on big-ticket purchases from builders, handymen and plumbers, who have cut spending during the crisis.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, helped by strong corporate earnings, as investors continue to price in a vigorous economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic after President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary talked up the prospects for a third-quarter rebound.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 32 points, or 1.1%, higher, and Nasdaq futures up 99 points, or 1.1%. The Dow futures contract rose 278 points, or 1.2%.  
Wall Street received a boost early Wednesday from the battered retail sector as Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) reported better-than-expected earnings, with same-store sales surging over 11%. The home improvement retailer has been trying to build out its e-commerce platform, and its efforts seem to have paid off during these times of social distancing. Lowe’s stock rose over 7% premarket.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) also posted stronger online and store sales, but its stock rose only 1.0% as higher costs ate into its bottom line. The retailer reported a 64% plunge in quarterly profit.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will also be in focus after it announced late on Tuesday it will stop selling its talc products in the U.S. and Canada amid a backdrop of ongoing legal claims that it causes cancer.
Biotech company  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which caused the late stumble in markets on Tuesday, fell another 4.5% in premarket in the wake of a report pouring cold water on the prospects for its experimental Covid-19 vaccine.
The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting will also garner attention Wednesday. In its rate statement last month, the Fed said it will keep interest rates at near-zero until officials are “confident that the economy has weathered recent events.”

BOSTON (Reuters) - Global hedge funds posted their biggest monthly gain in more than a decade in April when stocks rocketed higher with the help of government rescue packages designed to fuel growth stalled by the coronavirus outbreak, according to new data on Thursday.
The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index climbed 4.8% last month, marking its best showing since May 2009 when it gained 5.15% at the tail end of the financial crisis, research firm Hedge Fund Research said.
Managers that focus on stocks, bet on corporate events, and engage in activism by pushing management to perform better delivered the industry's biggest gains in a month that saw the Standard & Poor's 500 index gain 12.81%, HFR data shows.
Still, April's returns were not enough to erase three months of losses, including an 8.42% drop in March, and the average hedge fund remains in the red for the year with an average loss of 6.6%, the data shows. The S&P 500 index is off 9.28% in the first fourth months of 2020.
The difference between winners and losers was large last month, HFR said. It noted that the top decile of managers who submit their data to the firm gained 19.7% while the bottom decile fell 4.1%, representing a dispersion of 23.8 percentage points.
Big market swings, including the drop in oil prices, helped hedge funds in April, HFR President Ken Heinz said in a statement.
An uncertain outlook for the months ahead, as unemployment soars and certain sectors return to business after weeks of lockdown, could create ""dynamic opportunities for managers to generate outperformance through the remainder of the year,"" Heinz added.
Hedge funds often promise to protect capital from sharp market swings, but investors still get cold feet. They pulled $33 billion out of the hedge fund market as performance sagged in the first three months of the year, marking the biggest quarterly outflows in more than a decade, the HFR data shows.

Shares of the company rose as much as 8.1% in morning trade to top the FTSE 100 blue-chip index as it reported a 6.5% rise in full-year statutory revenue to $5.18 billion.
Experian (OTC:EXPGF) and its smaller peers —  Equifax Inc  (NYSE:EFX) and  TransUnion  (NYSE:TRU) — generate credit reports and scores based on consumer borrowing and payment habits, including bankruptcies and court judgements.
The company, whose credit reports are used by banks, car dealers, healthcare providers and retailers, said the COVID-19 crisis had only a ""limited financial impact"" in full year 2020.
The London-listed company said its several products including Ascend, Experian One, Open Data and CrossCore did well in the year, while Experian Boost saw ""significant progress"", among its U.S. consumers.
However, the company flagged that restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, would hurt its 2021 performance and forecast first-quarter organic revenue to decline by 5% to 10% if current trends continue throughout the period.
Experian said it expected near-term revenue to be impacted by the pandemic-related restrictions, adding that April revenue fell 5%.
The investors, however, shrugged off the coronavirus-related concerns.
JP Morgan analysts, in a note, said April trading was ""surprisingly resilient"" and was considerably better than its peers. 
Experian said its executive directors would take a 25% salary cut for six months as the data firm navigates a tough phase in managing costs.
The company's annual statutory pretax profit fell 1.6% to $942 million for the year ended March 31, below analysts' average estimate of $1.24 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1648,By Investing.com,"<span>May 20, 2020 05:38AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Rolls Royce to Cut 9,000 Jobs amid Pandemic","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- What happens when the lockdown lifts and there’s no job to go back to?
That’s the reality facing millions of workers worldwide and, as of Wednesday, nearly one in five workers at aero engine maker Rolls Royce (LON:RR).
The company, one of the biggest industrial employers in the U.K., said in a statement it will cut at least 9,000 of its 52,000 workforce, saying that it’s “increasingly clear” that the global commercial aviation business will take “several years” to recover from the impact of the pandemic. The news comes only a day after the U.K. jobless tally leaped by 70% in a month to its highest in 10 years, and gives added urgency to the question of what will be left of an advanced economy when the crisis passes.
Commercial aviation accounts for around half of Rolls Royce’s revenue and a proportionate share of its costs, so it’s no surprise to see the company aligning the latter with an outlook that has changed beyond recognition in the space of a couple of months. Most of its revenue comes from servicing engines than from making them, and many of its customers have grounded their fleets entirely in recent months. As for aircraft makers, they’ve cut production rates by around 40%, CEO Warren East told Sky News.
The company expects one-off restructuring costs of 800 million pounds ($976 million), but will generate 1.3 billion pounds a year in long-run savings.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), Rolls Royce shares were down 3.0%, while the FTSE 100 was flat. The benchmark Stoxx 600 edged 0.1% higher on a day without major macro catalysts.
The negative reaction to the news is all the more interesting because, in contrast to most of the market, the stock has seen no bounce worthy of the name since the Covid-19 disaster started to unfold. It didn’t hit its low for the year until last week, although it bounced smartly since then and is still 12% off that low.
That suggests that the market expects more bad news than the company disclosed today, possibly in the form of a capital raising.
It may also be that the market thinks the measures don’t reflect the severity of the downturn: even as lockdowns are being eased, airlines such as Southwest and United expect to be running at no more than 25% of capacity by July.
Additionally, there are question marks over Rolls Royce’s other businesses. The pandemic is widely expected to turn globalization into reverse, which may hit demand for its ship engines, and also to accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, which would spell more bad news for its already-challenged power turbine operations. Those two account for a quarter of revenue. Only the defense aerospace segment seems immune to virus impacts. 
The company, like many others, faces not only a deep crisis, but a long one.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>","Britain's Rolls-Royce to axe 9,000 jobs in air travel slump","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Rolls-Royce (L:RR) plans to cut at least 9,000 jobs, or more than a sixth of its workforce, in the latest blows to the UK economy and aviation industry dealt by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The company, which makes engines for planes such as the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 and Airbus 350, said on Wednesday it could also close factories as it shrinks to fit the smaller market it expects to emerge from the crisis. 
Airlines and their supplies have been among the hardest hit businesses by lockdowns to contain the pandemic, with passenger air travel grinding to a virtual halt. 
Britain, like many other economies, is also bracing for a deep recession, with jobless claims in April leaping to the highest in nearly 24 years.
""We have to reduce our cost base and adapt to the new world, matching our capacity with expected demand,"" Rolls-Royce chief executive Warren East told reporters, unveiling the company's biggest round of cuts since privatisation in 1987.
The 9,000 jobs, out of a global staff of 52,000, will go predominantly from Rolls's civil aerospace business, which generates just over half of its 15 billion pounds ($18 billion)of annual revenues.
Rolls said it was targeting 1.3 billion pounds of annual cost savings, with about 700 million coming from layoffs plus other cuts that could include factory closures.
Headquartered in Derby, central England, about two-thirds of Rolls civil aerospace jobs are based in the United Kingdom, East said, adding that was ""probably a good first proxy"" of where the jobs were likely to be lost.
East said Rolls had 16 to 17 major civil aerospace manufacturing locations across the world, including big presences in Germany and Singapore.
Consultations with unions will now get underway, with job losses also expected in office support functions. Rolls' defence unit will be spared, though, as military demand remains robust.
Forecasting air travel will not recover for three to five years, East said Rolls was preparing for aviation activity to be about a third less than in 2019. 
Government schemes to help pay workers had been useful in the short term, with Rolls' furloughing 4,000 staff under the UK scheme, but the company needs to prepare for a future where its airline customers fly less, East said. 
The cuts follow a 2018 programme to axe 4,600 jobs, although 1,000 job losses outstanding from that round are included in the 9,000. Rolls has also been grappling with a long-running engine problem which forced airlines to ground planes. 

Its shares were last down 2%, having dropped 62% this year to 11-year lows.

The government purchased the shares without informing parliament as part of a campaign to increase its influence over Air France's KLM subsidiary, arguing that if it had announced its intention publicly, it would have violated insider trading rules and increased the cost.
But, in a surprise ruling, the court said under the country's constitution, ministers ""must inform parliament of such transactions in advance,"" and not present them with a done deal after the fact.

LONDON (Reuters) - Listed companies in the European Union should state the uncertainties they face due to the coronavirus pandemic in their half-yearly reports and explain why they can stay in business, the bloc's securities watchdog said on Wednesday.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said that to provide relevant and reliable information, companies may need to use of the extra time allowed by national law to publish half-year results.
""ESMA also highlights the importance of providing information on the identification of the principal risks and uncertainties to which issuers are exposed,"" it said in a statement.
Financial firms should disclose the assumptions and judgments used to calculate how much they set aside in provisions to cover expected losses on loans, it said.
The half-yearly updates from companies should be particularly extensive because the events related to the COVID-19 outbreak have become evident in the first half of 2020.
Companies should also spell out conditions attached to any relief measures they have accepted from governments and regulators during the pandemic, it said.
""ESMA will collect data on how EU listed entities have applied the recommendations and will take into account those findings, amongst other considerations, in setting the enforcement priorities for the annual financial statements for the year 2020.""
Companies are already required to state why they believe they can stay in business for the coming 12 months as economies sink into deep recession with no recovery expected until 2021.
""In the context of half-yearly financial statements, ESMA expects issuers most significantly impacted by COVID-19, to provide disclosures about the going concern assessment and the related underlying judgments where these are significant,"" the watchdog said.

Half-yearly reports should also include detailed information about the pandemic's impact on strategy, targets, operations, financial performance, cash flows and disruptions to supply chains, ESMA said.

(Reuters) - European shares were flat on Wednesday after a downbeat session on Wall Street, as doubts over a potential COVID-19 vaccine fanned concerns about whether and how fast the world can successfully emerge from the coronavirus crisis.
Still, a boost from healthcare stocks (SXDP) helped the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) shed early losses, and the index was last trading flat.
Wall Street fell more than 1% overnight after a media report questioned the validity of the results of U.S. drugmaker  Moderna 's (O:MRNA) coronavirus vaccine trial that had sent stocks soaring on Monday.
A market recovery from March lows has stalled in May, as investors weigh the chance of a resurgence in coronavirus cases as many countries restart their economies after months-long lockdowns. The STOXX 600 is down 0.5% this month after a 6% jump in April.
""Investors are playing a waiting game,"" said Edmund Shing, global head of equity derivatives strategy at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). ""The reason for that is we want to see how the exit from lockdowns proceed and see how quickly each economy picks up.""
European markets have cheered a Franco-German proposal this week for a 500 billion-euro Recovery Fund that would bind all 27 European Union states to raise debt jointly to offer grants to regions hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
However, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Tuesday a group of EU states will propose funding the recovery efforts with loans, not grants.
A series of positive corporate updates limited losses in the markets. 
Shares of British retailer Marks & Spencer (L:MKS) jumped 4.0% after saying that it would accelerate its latest turnaround programme as it dealt with the fallout from the coronavirus crisis and reported a 21% fall in annual profit.
The world's biggest credit data company Experian Plc (L:EXPN) gained 6.4% as it said its executive directors would take a 25% salary cut for six months, but forecast first-quarter organic revenue to decline by just 5% to 10%.
AstraZeneca Plc (L:AZN) rose 1.3% after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Merck Inc's (N:MRK) and its Lynparza as a treatment for a form of prostate cancer.
French food group  Danone  (PA:DANO) rose 0.8% after it confirmed it would pay out a 2019 dividend and that no share buyback operations would take place this year.
Swedish video game group Embracer (ST:EMBRACb) tumbled 9.6% after weak quarterly report.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 05:06AM ET</span>",Germany approves new powers to block foreign takeovers in healthcare,"(Reuters) - Germany gave itself new powers to veto hostile foreign takeover bids for healthcare companies on Wednesday, a measure designed to ensure a continuous supply of essential products during the coronavirus crisis.
The regulation, approved by the cabinet, will allow the government to block takeovers of makers of vaccines, precursor chemicals, medicines, protective equipment or medical machinery such as ventilators.
The measure comes after the early stages of the coronavirus saw a worldwide run on materials believed crucial to combat COVID-19 - the respiratory disease caused by the new virus - including reported attempts by the United States government to buy Curevac, a pharmaceuticals start-up that was working to develop a vaccine against the disease.
In future, the government will be allowed to examine the security implications of a bid from outside the European Union as soon as the buyer holds more than 10% of the healthcare company's shares. Now, the threshold is 25%.
Media reports that the United States tried to gain access to unlisted CureVac or the vaccine it was working on prompted German cabinet members to voice support for keeping the biotech firm German. CureVac has denied having received U.S. offers.
The boss of Germany's BioNTech (O:BNTX), also a contestant in the race to find a vaccine, told a newspaper in April that a takeover was out of the question and that the company had received unspecified approaches.
The move echoes earlier moves by Berlin to protect the high-tech companies that have made its economy an exporting powerhouse from takeover bids by ambitious, fast-growing Chinese rivals.
Some in the industry were critical of the latest move, arguing that it sends the wrong signal in the midst of a crisis.

""During a crisis it is more important than ever to stand for open markets,"" the Federation of German Industry's board member Stefan Mair said in a statement.

Strategists only expect the Euro Stoxx 50 Index to rise another 3.8% from Monday’s closing level to 3,023 by the end of the year, according to the average response in a poll by Bloomberg News. That will still leave the benchmark down 19% in 2020. They predict the broader Stoxx Europe 600 Index will close at 361, about 5.6% higher by the end of 2020.
While European stocks rebounded strongly in April from the rout spurred by widespread coronavirus-induced lockdowns, the gains have lost momentum in May. Optimism over stimulus measures and the easing of restrictions has given way to bleak economic and earnings reports, and worries about a second wave of infections. Making matters worse, deteriorating rhetoric between the U.S. and China has stoked renewed fears of a trade war.
The degree of uncertainty related to the pandemic is prompting a wide range in strategists’ predictions. Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) is among the most bullish forecasters, calling for the Stoxx 600 to close the year at 440, or about 29% higher from here. At the bearish end of the spectrum,  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) NV expects a 9.2% drop.
They see a 0.5% decline from Monday’s closing level through the year’s end for the cyclical-heavy DAX Index of Germany. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index fares better in their estimates, set to rise another 4.3%.

1658,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 20, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",BofA Warns of Volatility-Shock Risk as Markets Get More Fragile,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors need to guard against violent price swings as markets become increasingly fragile, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
Fragility has increased due to high-frequency traders shutting down machines as stress rises, which hurts liquidity, as well as by trend-chasing among investors reaching for better returns “against their better judgment in a world addicted to the central bank put,” BofA strategists led by Nitin Saksena wrote in a note May 19. That’s also created “a massive log-jam for liquidity” when things go sour, as players with little conviction rush for the exits, they said.
“With most institutional investors believing this is a bear rally, but at risk of being forced to chase the trend if it continues (having been conditioned as such in the last 10 years), the risk is of bigger bubbles leading to larger shocks,” the strategists wrote. “There will be plenty of opportunity (and time) for negative surprises to arise, given the sheer size of this economic crisis, even with a vaccine on fast-track.”
Asset prices have certainly moved with speed as Covid-19 wreaked havoc on economies and markets worldwide. The S&P 500 suffered its quickest-ever downdraft from a record into a correction. And as markets recovered amid waves of central-bank pledges and fiscal measures, the rebound was quick, too. Both the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, and Europe’s VStoxx have fallen near their fastest paces in history, BofA said.
“History suggests markets won’t escape economic reality, and that this bear market will be similar in length to that of the ensuing recession,” BofA said.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 02:50AM ET</span>",Did hedge funds score on masks and sanitizer? Not so much,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Lawrence Delevingne
BOSTON (Reuters) - What would seem like a sure win for elite investors - early bets on companies racing to make face masks, hand sanitizer and other coronavirus-related protective products - turned out to be a relatively unpopular strategy and one with surprisingly mixed results. 
Few hedge funds increased their holdings over the first quarter in companies associated with so-called personal protective equipment (PPE) such as 3M Co. (N:MMM), Kimberly-Clark Corp (N:KMB) and Honeywell International Inc (N:HON), according to a Reuters review of regulatory filings compiled by research firm Symmetric.io showing stock positions as of March 31.
Hedge funds, on a net basis, sold off more than $760 million in those three stocks over the first quarter, according to Symmetric.io data, bringing the number of funds that own them down to 225 from 230.
Ironically, firms that seized on the opportunity early, including Maverick Capital, Point72 Asset Management and D.E. Shaw Group, have likely faced paper losses given share price declines so far this year, assuming they still hold those stocks.
Playing the pandemic, investors said, was difficult amid roller-coaster trading fueled by fears of the virus' spread, surging unemployment rates, tumbling oil prices and government stimulus spending. By the end of March, the S&P 500 stock index had ended its 11-year bull market run and was off around 20% for the year. 
Adding to the complexity, the large companies now closely associated with protective equipment faced separate challenges. 
St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M, for example, became a household mask name as people around the country raced to hardware stores and online to buy the company's N95 products. But the company's stock price is off 15.4% this year as mask sales make up only a small portion of revenue, broadly hit as products for the manufacturing sector lagged as factories like automakers were shut down.
Hedge fund firms Alyeska Investment Group, Laurion Capital Management, Point72 and Balyasny Asset Management all put on new positions in 3M during the first quarter, filings show; Millennium Management added to its sizable holdings. 
Representatives for the firms declined to comment on the investments or did not respond to requests.
Honeywell, which makes electronics and materials for the aerospace, building and other industries, also ramped up its mask-making business as the virus spread. 
Maverick, already a top holder, added to its stake in the first quarter and Arrowstreet Capital, put on a new position, filings show. Still, Honeywell's stock price is off 24.3%, more than the S&P 500's roughly 8% loss this year.
Hedge fund bets on smaller PPE-focused companies produced better results.
Balyasny and Arrowstreet were among the hedge funds to initiate investments over the first quarter in protective clothing maker  Lakeland Industries  (O:LAKE), valued at $108 million. Lakeland's stock price is up 26% this year. 
Tudor Investment Corp, Millennium and Arrowstreet all made new investments in MSA Safety (N:MSA) during the first quarter, filings show. Stock of MSA, which makes protective face gear among other things, has gained 12% in the last four weeks but remains off 4% for the year. 
And Tiburon Opportunity Fund LP, a small hedge fund that usually focuses on financial stocks, held and slightly added to its position in Edison Nation Inc (O:EDNT), which recently scored a large sanitizer and mask contract. The small company's stock price rocketed higher to now trade with a 22% gain for the year. 
Tiburon boss Peter Bortel told Reuters that his fund is off about 16% for the year but that PPE-related bets have helped mitigate those losses. 

""There was clearly a great business opportunity,"" Bortel said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian stocks struggled to extend the week's rally on Wednesday, and gold and bonds firmed, as a sceptical press report dented some hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine and concerns about the global recovery from the pandemic returned.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat. The risk-sensitive Australian dollar retreated from a two-month high struck on Tuesday and safe-haven demand drove U.S. Treasury yields back under 0.7%.
European futures were subdued with FTSE futures and EuroSTOXX 50 futures down 0.3%. S&P 500 futures rose 0.6%.
The drift follows a downbeat end to Tuesday trade on Wall Street after a report from medical news website STAT cast doubt over encouraging early results from a  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc COVID-19 vaccine trial. 
The report said the results, which had rallied global stocks this week, lacked detail.
""This is probably more a stabilisation than anything else, because markets have rallied hard on opening up and the potential for a V-shaped recovery,"" said Jun Bei Liu, a portfolio manager at Australia's Tribeca Investment Partners.
""The market is a little bit directionless,"" she said, with investors waiting to take their next cues from company outlook commentaries and confidence surveys.
Two thirds of 223 fund managers surveyed by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) reckon recent gains are a bear-market rally.
Around Asia, the Chinese yuan and stocks in Hong Kong and China idled just under flat as investors wait to hear the government's economic plans, due to be announced during the annual gathering of parliament beginning on Friday.
Australian shares ground higher and Japan's Nikkei rose 1%, helped by a softer yen and anticipation that declining infection rates will make a case for swift economic re-opening. 
Oil was steady and benchmark 10-year yields on U.S. Treasuries dipped 1.5 basis points to 0.6948%. Yields fall when prices rise.
Gold rose slightly to $1,745.84 per ounce. 
WOBBLY RECOVERY
Doubts about the outlook held back commodity prices from further gains, as more bad news poured forth.
Japanese business confidence slumped to a decade low as the economy entered recession while Australian retail sales suffered their steepest ever dive in April. British jobless claims are at their highest in 20 years.
And the U.S. economy won't recover its lost ground until sometime after next year, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said on Tuesday.
Brent crude futures rose about 1% a barrel to $34.93 and U.S. crude rose 0.7% to $32.17. 
""While countries have started to relax restrictions on economic and social activities, economies will not return to where things were before the outbreak,"" said strategist at Singapore's DBS bank in a note.
""Geopolitical tensions, especially between the U.S. and China, have also returned and are likely to intensify into the U.S. elections in November.""
In currency markets the euro remained supported in the afterglow of a Franco-German proposal for a common relief fund - a possible way through tensions between European Union members. It inched up to $1.0940.

Other majors steadied, while the Aussie and kiwi battled, mostly without success, to break out of the ranges that have held them for months.

1662,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",Johnson & Johnson to stop selling talc baby powder in U.S. and Canada,"By Carl O'Donnell and Lisa Girion
(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday announced it would stop selling its talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, saying demand had dropped in the wake of what it called ""misinformation"" about the product’s safety amid a barrage of legal challenges. 
J&J faces more than 19,000 lawsuits from consumers and their survivors claiming its talc products caused cancer due to contamination with asbestos, a known carcinogen. Many are pending before a U.S. district judge in New Jersey.
""I wish my mother could be here to see this day,"" said Crystal Deckard, whose mother Darlene Coker alleged Baby Powder caused her mesothelioma. She dropped the suit filed in 1999 after losing her fight to compel J&J to divulge internal records. Coker died of mesothelioma in 2009.
In its statement, J&J said it ""remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson's Baby Powder,"" citing ""decades of scientific studies."" 
J&J has faced intense scrutiny of the safety of its baby powder following an investigative report by Reuters in 2018 that found the company knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc.
Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. 
(To read the Reuters special report click, https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/ )
The Reuters article prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from J&J’s market value in one day and created a public relations crisis as the blue-chip healthcare conglomerate faced widespread questions about the possible health effects of one of its most iconic products.
J&J has also been the target of a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about its talc products’ safety, an investigation by 41 states into its baby powder sales, which it disclosed in April, and an investigation into health risks of asbestos in talc-containing consumer products by a Congressional subcommittee.
U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, who led the Congressional inquiry, described J&J's decision to stop selling talc baby powder as ""a major victory for public health"", adding: ""My Subcommittee’s 14-month investigation revealed that Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that its product contains asbestos."" 
In response to evidence of asbestos contamination presented in media reports, in the court room and on Capitol Hill, J&J has repeatedly said its talc products are safe, and do not cause cancer.
Apart from the baby powder controversy, the company revered by millions of consumers and one of the most trusted brands in America, more recently has faced a series of legal and reputational challenges. 
J&J has said it has been named as a defendant, along with other drugmakers, in more than 2,900 lawsuits alleging the companies improperly promoted addictive opioids.
In August, an Oklahoma judge rendered the first verdict in that litigation, ordering J&J to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers. 
J&J is appealing the Oklahoma judge's ruling and has denied it caused the opioid crisis. 
Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday said it had stopped shipping talc baby powder when the COVID-19 crisis led to limits on shopping and manufacturing, and that now it would wind down North American sales. 
""Demand for talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder in North America has been declining due in large part to changes in consumer habits and fueled by misinformation around the safety of the product and a constant barrage of litigation advertising,"" it said in a statement.
Sold continuously since 1894, Johnson’s Baby Powder now accounts for only about 0.5% of its U.S. consumer health business, the company said. But it remains a symbol of the company's family-friendly image.
An internal J&J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J’s “#1 Asset,” grounded in “deep, personal trust"" and a 2003 internal memo described it as a ""sacred cow,"" Reuters reported.
Christie Nordhielm, a professor of marketing at Georgetown, said it appears J&J made its decision to withdraw from the market while consumers are preoccupied with the pandemic. ""It's a nice time to quietly do it,"" she said, adding ""it will minimize the reputational hit.""
Shares of J&J were unchanged in after-hours trading following the disclosure.
""We will continue to vigorously defend the product, its safety, and the unfounded allegations against it and the Company in the courtroom,"" Johnson & Johnson said. ""All verdicts against the company that have been through the appeals process have been overturned.""
Krystal Kim, one of 22 women with ovarian cancer whose case in St. Louis resulted in a 2018 jury verdict of $4.69 billion against J&J, said the decision was ""a step in the right direction."" J&J has appealed that verdict.
Nevertheless, J&J's legal challenges likely will continue, some lawyers said. In April, a New Jersey judge ruled that thousands of plaintiffs who allege J&J's talc products caused cancer can go forward with their claims, but face limits on what expert testimony would be allowed in trials. 
""Just taking it off the shelf today doesn’t end the litigation by a long shot,"" said Loyola Law Professor Adam Zimmerman.
Asbestos is known to cause cancer that emerges decades after exposure. Cases involving asbestos-containing products removed from the marketplace long ago ""continue to be litigated very actively to this day,"" Zimmerman said.
Many of the lawsuits allege Baby Powder caused plaintiffs' mesothelioma, an incurable cancer of the lining of the lungs and other organs commonly caused by asbestos.
""Just as J&J vows to continue fighting vigorously in the courts, we look forward to meeting them there as we continue to pursue justice for our clients,"" said Chris Placitella, one of the lead lawyers representing plaintiffs in the cases consolidated in a New Jersey federal court.

J&J said it will continue to sell cornstarch-based baby powder in North America, and will sell both its talc and cornstarch-based products in other markets around the world.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 01:45AM ET</span>",Outlook for European corporate profits worsens further,"LONDON (Reuters) - Expectations for second- and third-quarter corporate profits are deteriorating further in Europe, despite a gradual easing across the continent of lockdowns aimed at curbing the coronavirus pandemic, Refinitiv data showed on Wednesday.
Companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) are now expected to report a decline of 48.4% in second-quarter earnings, down from a drop of 46.7% forecast the week before.
For the third quarter, analyst expectations are now set for a 35.3% fall in earnings, versus 35.1% a week ago.
Analysts believe the expected recovery from the recession will be gradual and the economy will not bounce back, let alone return to normal, before the first quarters of 2021.
The last three months of 2020 are expected to see STOXX 600 earnings fall by 16.5%, before bouncing back respectively to 27.2% and 53.1% for the first two quarters of next year. 

Before the pandemic, analysts had expected the first quarter of 2020 to bring an end to Europe's corporate recession that had lasted through 2019.

1664,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",Coronavirus crushes Australia's dividends with banks leading the decline,"By Scott Murdoch and Tom Westbrook
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Australia has made the deepest dividend cuts globally this year, with more than $6 billion deferred or cancelled as companies conserve cash to ride out the coronavirus, turning foreign investors wary of the country's normally high-yielding firms.
Payout changes have been announced over the past two months and strategists believe more are coming as companies sign off annual accounts on June 30.
Data from stockbroker Ord Minnett showed A$9.72 billion ($6.4 billion) worth of cuts and deferrals so far. Fund manager Janus Henderson calculated a first-quarter contraction that was the steepest among major markets.
Australia is considered one of the world's highest-yielding markets but the dividend cuts could cause it to lose some of its competitive advantage. The cuts will be keenly felt locally too among a population boasting one of the world's highest rates of share ownership and given a A$3 trillion pension system heavily skewed towards equities.
""There has been meaningful impact on the Australian market given the large weighting of financials and the focus of cuts and deferrals in that sector this year,"" said Ord Minnett's head of private client research, Simon Kent-Jones.
Financials comprise more than a quarter of the benchmark stock price index (AXJO) and, under pressure to demonstrate stability to regulators, account for the steepest cuts.
Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), the second-largest bank by market capitalisation, deferred its first-half dividend, saving it A$3.39 billion - equivalent to almost a third of 2019 operating expenses. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd's (AX:ANZ) followed suit and saved A$2.26 billion.
National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) cut its dividend by 75% to its lowest in three decades and saved A$1.58 billion.
Portfolio manager Scott Kelly at DNR Capital, which manages A$5.5 billion, said reduced dividends could last for at least three years.
""Companies will be maintaining more conservative balance sheets, they will be making structural decisions and that will mean we see lower dividends,"" Kelly told Reuters.
Australia has the world's second-highest level of equity ownership with the stock exchange's latest estimates from 2017 showing 37% of people directly own shares outside of their pension funds, second only to Hong Kong's 41%.
Globally, dividends rose 3.6% to a record $275.4 billion in January-March due mostly to one-off payouts in the United States, showed an analysis by Janus Henderson.
However, it forecast a global drop of 15% to 35% this year, or as much as $933 billion.
It found dividends paid in Australia over the last quarter fell 35.2% versus a year earlier, the most of any major market.
""We've avoided the banks,"" said Sat Duhra, who manages Janus Henderson's dividend strategy in Asia. ""The valuations in North Asia are more compelling and we think the earnings outlook is more compelling.""
Global equity strategists forecast annual dividends this year to fall 26.6% in Australia, versus 16.6% in Britain, 2.5% in the United States and 2% in Japan, Refinitiv data showed.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - A company linked to China's scandal-hit  Luckin Coffee  Inc (O:LK) is seeking fresh capital, sources said, highlighting the ripple effect of Luckin's fabricated transactions as the chairman of both firms scrambles to avoid a cash crunch.
UCAR Inc, founded by Charles Zhengyao Lu, is looking to sell its limited partner (LP) interest worth 1 billion yuan ($141 million) in Chinese private equity firm Centurium Capital's yuan fund, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The chauffeured car service provider, in which Lu is the biggest shareholder owning roughly 10%, has approached prospective investors for its 30.75% LP interest in UCAR Industrial Fund, managed by Centurium, said the people. Private equity fund investors are also known as LPs.
The move comes as alleged fraud at Luckin has weighed on Lu's interests and dented sentiment toward U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. Luckin on April 2 revealed much of its 2019 sales were fabricated, sending its shares down more than 80%. UCAR shares have also since fallen nearly 60%.
UCAR and Lu did not respond to requests for comment. Centurium, which is also a Luckin shareholder, declined to comment. The people spoke on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.
UCAR on April 17 said the scandal had prompted financial institutions and suppliers to demand payment, and that it was considering ways of avoiding a bigger liquidity hit.
Last month, UCAR said it had agreed to sell a stake in a fintech firm to UCAR Industrial Fund for 250 million yuan and sell part of its holdings in auto rental firm CAR Inc (HK:0699), also founded by Lu, to Warburg Pincus for up to $144 million.
UCAR Industrial Fund has raised about 3.25 billion yuan since inception in 2017 and focuses on auto- and consumer-related investments, such as in electric vehicle maker Xpeng Motors, two of the people said. 
Its largest LPs are UCAR and a unit of the asset management joint venture between Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) Ltd (SS:601398) (HK:1398) and  Credit Suisse  Group AG (S:CSGN), with the latter committing 1.5 billion yuan, the corporate registry showed.

Undeterred by the pandemic, William O'Neil+Co last month obtained the regulatory go-ahead to launch local-currency funds in China, and will soon apply for a license to raise money locally for offshore investment, CEO Steven Birch said in an interview.
""We see evolutionary parallels between the U.S. and China as young people better understand how to save and build wealth for themselves and their families,"" Birch said.
The Los Angeles-headquartered company aims to bring quant-based investment strategies to China's retail-heavy stock market, where many trade on tips and rumors.
The move comes as China hastens the opening up of its financial industry amid renewed tension with the United States over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Birch hailed China's announcement earlier this month to scrap quotas under QFII, a key inbound investment scheme for foreign institutions.
O'Neil's bestselling book ""How to Make Money in Stocks"" is popular among Chinese stock pickers, and the firm plans to launch a series of yuan-denominated private funds that invest in local markets.
The funds' strategies include O'Neil's proprietary CAN SLIM stock selection methodology, which seeks to identify stock winners using a blend of fundamental and technical analysis, with factors adapted to trading patterns in China, according to Birch.
William O'Neil will also seek a license under Shanghai's QDLP outbound investment scheme, with plans to channel Chinese money into its global strategies, Birch said.
The company also owns MarketSmith, a stock research platform used by retail investors, with 30% of its users now from China.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  HSBC Holdings  PLC (L:HSBA) expects to achieve double-digit asset growth in its newly combined wealth business in Asia Pacific in the next three years, as it looks to grab a bigger share of the growing rich population, the unit's regional head told Reuters.
The Asia-focused lender in February announced the merger of its global private banking and retail wealth businesses to create a new wealth and personal banking unit, part of a radical strategy overhaul at Europe's largest lender by assets.
The combined wealth business, which came into effect on May 1, manages assets worth about $1.3 trillion globally, with nearly half of that in Asia, where bulk of it is accounted for by its fast-growing mass affluent customer base.
Aiming to become the top wealth manager in Asia Pacific in the medium-to-long-term, HSBC plans to sharpen its focus on clients with investable assets of over $1 million, said Greg Hingston, regional head of wealth and personal banking business.
""With the combination, there is a big, big focus on family offices going forward. And it all fits within that focus around increasing penetration into the high and ultra-high networth segments,"" said Hingston, who took over the new role on April 1.
Historical data for the combined wealth business are yet to be reported. The bank's global retail wealth assets in the first quarter grew 6% from a year-ago to $480 billion, while private banking client assets fell 2% to $329 billion.
Even as the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted normal trade and banking services, Hingston said HSBC had seen increased usage of digital technologies by its wealth management clients.

In Hong Kong, the bank's biggest market, the average monthly forex transaction value through digital channels by its wealth management clients grew 65% in the first quarter and monthly equity trading turnover rose 63%.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning, retreating from their gains on Tuesday.
Investors digested a report from several vaccine experts that said that U.S. drug maker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) provided insufficient information to determine how effective its potential vaccine for the COVID-19 virus actually is.
Moderna’s Monday announcement that its vaccine appeared to be generating an immune response in all its 45 trial participants, boosted stocks on Tuesday. But the experts warned that the announcement should be taken “with a big grain of salt.”
Meanwhile, China’s central bank left both the 1-year loan prime rate and the 5-year loan prime rate unchanged at 3.85%, and 4.65% respectively.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.45% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.37% by 11:37 PM ET (4:37 AM GMT), with U.S.-China tensions continuing to simmer in the background.
The country's National People’s Congress will kick off on Friday after a two-month delay due to COVID-19.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.12%, giving up some of its earlier gains, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.96%. 
The Reuters Tankan survey showed that Japanese business confidence hit decade lows in May, with firms bracing for a protracted period of economic turmoil due to COVID-19.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.21%, even with the country struggling to contain its second wave of cases originating in nightclubs around Seoul’s Itaewon neighborhood. 32 new cases were reported on Tuesday, the most since May 11, and brings the total number of cases in the country to 11,110.
But Korean high school seniors returned to their classrooms today as schools started a reopening program in stages.
Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 0.06%, slowly reversing its earlier losses.
As Moderna's announcement damped investor sentiment, some investors cautiously held onto the small hope of an economic recovery.
“We are being fairly cautious,” Shawn Matthews, founder and chief investment officer at Hondius Capital Management LP, told Bloomberg.
But he added, “If you look at the economy, it feels like it’s the summer of hope right now, where everyone is hoping it’s going to turn around.”"

“We will lock down villages with coronavirus cases so that we can preserve economic activity,” Carlito Galvez, chief implementer of the nation’s policies to stem the outbreak, said in a televised briefing late Tuesday.
Stricter curbs may be brought back should a second wave of infections occur, President Rodrigo Duterte said at the same briefing, as the government prepares for the arrival of more returning overseas workers. Malls and some businesses have been allowed to open in the capital since May 16.
The gradual lifting of restrictions is in line with strategies adopted in other countries as governments remain wary over the risk of a resurgence in infections. In the Philippines, confirmed cases of the virus are at almost 13,000.
Some 42,000 Filipino migrant workers are set to arrive until June, which might overwhelm the nation’s quarantine facilities, Galvez said. More than 27,000 repatriated workers are staying at isolation centers in the capital.

Just a few weeks ago, crude oil was akin to industrial waste in some parts of the world, something you had to pay people to take away. Now prices are surging, up about 70% in New York since the start of May.
The turnaround, which has been welcomed from Riyadh and Moscow to the White House, came quicker than most people were expecting but wasn’t easy. Painful OPEC+ production cuts and the world’s risky first steps out of coronavirus lockdown have lifted the market out of the abyss of negative prices, but either of them could falter.
“I think the worst is behind,” said Pierre Andurand, chief investment officer and founder of Andurand Capital Management LLP. “OPEC+ cut enough, and demand will slowly, gradually recover.”

In one of the most extraordinary 20-minute spans in the history of financial markets, West Texas Intermediate fell as low as minus $40.32 a barrel, stunning everyone from veteran brokers to retail investors.
Two big things have changed since then.
First, the flood of unwanted crude has abated. Saudi Arabia ended its price war with Russia and stopped flooding the market with record production. Instead, the pair led their allies in the OPEC+ alliance to make their deepest and fastest output cuts on record.
U.S. shale companies have also shut down unprofitable wells at an unprecedented rate.
As much as 17 million barrels of a day of crude will have been taken off the market by next month, Mohammad Barkindo, secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
At the same time, the 30% drop in global oil consumption seen in April is abating. Green shoots of recovery are emerging around the world as businesses reopen and drivers return to the roads from Berlin to Beijing.
The oil glut is shrinking and the great fear that motivated the slump in U.S. prices below zero -- that holders of expiring contracts would have nowhere to store crude when it was delivered -- appears to have been averted.
WTI for June delivery settled at $32.50 a barrel on Tuesday, slightly higher than the price for July. That’s a clear sign that holders of the expiring front-month contract weren’t fearful of getting stuck with unwanted barrels.
“Concerns about the planet running out of places to store crude and product have evaporated,” said Judith Dwarkin, chief economist at RS Energy Group. “Near-month prices in the physical market are factoring this in as well as for the outlook ahead.”
Risky Rally
The month dubbed “Black April” by International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol is over, but the market still faces considerable risks.
The reopening of any number of battered economies across Asia, Europe and the Americas will be difficult, and could be set back at any moment by a second wave of Covid-19 infections. The enthusiasm for cutting production shown by U.S. shale companies or OPEC+ could weaken.
The faltering recovery from the 1998 Asian economic crisis offers a playbook, said Greg Sharenow, a portfolio manager focused on energy and commodities at Pacific Investment Management Co.
“You had a bunch of rallies, a bunch of sell-offs” in the 18 months after the initial oil-price slump, Sharenow said in an interview from Newport Beach, California. There’s a strong recovery right now, but “you have unemployment numbers around the world and you have income shocks -- those are pretty powerful opposing forces.”
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said this week that the U.S. economic recovery could drag on until the end of 2021. Even that gradual timetable could be threatened if there’s a second wave of the pandemic, he warned.
“I think it will take a long time for demand to recover fully though, probably until we have a vaccine,” said Andurand, whose main fund is up almost 70% this year after successful bets on the direction of prices.
Topsy Turvy
For now, there’s palpable relief that normal service has returned to the oil market. While a crude price in the $30s is still too low to balance the budgets of most OPEC+ states, ministers from Saudi Arabia to Russia appear satisfied with the fruits of their labor.
Even major energy importers show little desire to return to those few days when producers had to pay consumers to take their crude.
Price wars, topsy-turvy oil benchmarks and dislocations in long-standing relationships between markets “are things you don’t see normally and are unsustainable,” said Mukesh Kumar Surana, chairman of India’s Hindustan Petroleum Corp.

""In terms of local Australian partners we have been approached by a number of Australian entities and at the end of the day we would like to have an Australian partner,"" he said in a webinar hosted by CAPA Centre for Aviation on Tuesday. ""It is the right thing to do. But it all depends on the details.""
Indigo, a private equity investor in low-cost airlines globally including Frontier Airlines and  Wizz Air Holdings PLC  (L:WIZZ), was one of four parties shortlisted by administrators to buy Virgin Australia, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Monday. The others are BGH Capital, Bain Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners, the person said.
Oaktree did not respond immediately for a request for comment on its partnership with Indigo. 
Binding offers for Australia's second-biggest airline are due on June 12. The company entered voluntary administration last month owing nearly A$7 billion ($4.6 billion), making it the biggest Asia-Pacific casualty of the coronavirus crisis hitting the global aviation industry.
The strong interest in Virgin Australia at a time when the world aviation market is largely grounded shows the long-time attractiveness of the Australian domestic market, a duopoly between Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Virgin Australia.
""We think the country needs two airlines and we want to be able to assist Virgin Australia in being one of those two airlines,"" Franke said.
Indigo had not yet decided whether Virgin Australia would keep its international operations or become a low-cost carrier if its proposal was successful.

""We have to look at the Australian market in terms of what the consumer wants in the product,"" Franke said.

LONDON/BRASILIA (Reuters) - British supermarkets have warned Brazil they might have to boycott its products if lawmakers there pass a contentious bill that could enable faster destruction of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
Sainsbury's, Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Morrisons and Marks & Spencer were among more than 40 companies to sign an open letter https://www.retailsoygroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Letter-from-Business-on-Amazon.pdf urging Brazil's national legislature to reject the proposed bill, backed by President Jair Bolsonaro.
The letter said the law would encourage ""further land grabbing and widespread deforestation"" which would endanger the survival of the Amazon, the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, and the rights of indigenous communities. 
""We believe that it would also put at risk the ability of organisations such as ours to continue sourcing from Brazil in the future,"" the letter said.
Brazil's lower house speaker, Rodrigo Maia, earlier said he would introduce the bill on the floor of Congress on Wednesday for a potential vote.
Settlers in the Brazilian Amazon have for decades laid claim to public land without official government sanction, often clearing forest to grow export crops such as soy or raise cattle. 
The proposal before Congress – known as ""land regularization"" by the agriculture lobby and ""the land speculation law"" by environmentalists – will make it easier for those that settled on public land historically to obtain deeds for their properties, under certain circumstances.
Supporters of the bill say that legally titling the land is an essential step towards forcing owners to comply with environmental laws to limit deforestation in the Amazon. 
Environmentalists say the bill would effectively reward land speculators for massive illegal deforestation carried out in the past, while opening the floodgates to further clearing and settlement of public forest land.
Amazon research institute Imazon estimates the bill would hasten the deforestation of 11,000-16,000 square kilometres (4,247-6,178 square miles).
After intense debate in Brazil, the bill has been substantially diluted relative to the original, including removal of a provision to allow more recently occupied properties to apply for deeds.
Nevertheless, signatories to the letter, which included agribusiness companies and investors such as Sweden's AP7 pension fund and Norwegian insurer Storebrand, said they were ""deeply concerned"" about the proposed bill.

""We urge the Brazilian government to reconsider its stance and hope to continue working with partners in Brazil to demonstrate that economic development and environmental protection are not mutually exclusive,"" the letter said.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Third Point founder Daniel Loeb takes over as Munib Islam leaves firm,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Daniel Loeb is taking back the reins as sole chief investment officer at his hedge fund Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) LLC, less than one year after he appointed long-time colleague Munib Islam to be his co-chief investment officer, according to a letter the firm sent its investors.
Loeb, who is about to celebrate his 25th anniversary at Third Point, told investors about his decision in a three-paragraph letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
Loeb wrote that he is excited about ""investing in this period of change and turmoil."" He thanked Islam for his many contributions over the years and said that he expects their friendship to endure.
The shake-up in the top ranks of the one of world's most closely watched hedge funds comes as Third Point laid the groundwork for succession last year by promoting Islam to co-chief investment officer. Islam initially came to Third Point straight out of Stanford Business School in 2004 before leaving in 2008. He returned as head of equity research in 2011. 
Islam worked closely with Loeb on shaping some of the firm's biggest activist campaigns at companies such as  Sony  Corp (T:6758) and Nestle SA (S:NESN).
Islam, 46, will retire from New York-based Third Point but will continue to advise it in a consulting capacity until the end of the year. 
Islam was not immediately available for comment and a representative for Third Point declined to comment.
Over the years, Loeb has cemented his reputation as a focused and savvy investor who has navigated previous financial crises successfully. While people close to the firm say there was no break between the men, Loeb felt strongly that this crisis demanded his leadership, alone. 
While Third Point, like many hedge funds, lost money in the first three months of 2020, the firm gained 7% in April as Loeb shifted focus. Over its lifetime, Third Point has returned roughly 14% a year.
Third Point is down 10.4% for 2020 after having gained 17% in 2019. Assets shrunk to $14 billion this year from $16 billion at the end of last year.
Third Point has built a reputation as an influential activist shareholder by pushing for changes at companies such as Sony (NYSE:SNE),  Prudential  Plc (L:PRU) and  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) in the last few years.
In an earlier letter sent to investors in April, Loeb said that Third Point had not adequately prepared for a possible full-blown pandemic and was caught flat-footed when the world was essentially shut down to blunt the virus' spread.

Its heavy bets on stocks, especially in the aerospace, airline and auto-related sectors, hurt performance which was down 16% at one portfolio in the first three months of 2020, according to an earlier letter.

1677,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 19, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Millions of Newly Jobless in China Pose a Looming Threat to Xi,"(Bloomberg) -- The Pearl River Delta industrial belt has served as one of China’s most important growth engines since the Communist Party opened the economy four decades ago, propelling its rise to become one of the world’s leading powers.
But now in Guangdong, a southern coastal province that alone would stand as one of Asia’s top five economies, the situation is getting dire in some labor-intensive sectors that are more China’s past than future. In the dank back-alleys of Dongguan, a metropolis with about as many people as New York City, small textile makers are struggling to survive. Thousands of migrant workers have already headed back to China’s poorer interior.
“You can see around here, nine out of ten textile workshops have already shut down,” the owner of one shop, who gave his surname as Long, said last week over the sound of whirring sewing machines. His ten remaining employees have seen their take-home pay cut in half due to long idle periods. “Their income levels have returned to what they were ten years ago,” Long’s wife said.
The widespread struggle to earn cash risks turning into a big political problem for Chinese President Xi Jinping. While the authoritarian state doesn’t hold democratic elections, it still faces strong internal pressures to deliver economic gains to the nation’s 1.4 billion people. And Xi in particular has zeroed in on income levels as a key source of its overall legitimacy to govern.
In a Dec. 31 speech, Xi said 2020 would mark a “milestone” as China finishes “building a moderately prosperous society.” As originally envisaged, that involved doubling per-capita income by 2020 from 2010 levels, doubling gross domestic product and eliminating poverty. Xi has called those goals “a solemn promise our party has made to the people and to the history.”
Already challenged by the long economic slowdown and the U.S.-China trade war, those goals are suddenly being pushed out of reach by the coronavirus pandemic. That reality is expected to be clear this week at the annual meeting of the legislature, the biggest political event of the year in China: Xi’s government may avoid giving a numerical growth target for the first time in decades as the world’s second-largest economy braces for its worst performance in the post-Mao era.
“This has put great pressure on Xi, who has personally advocated such goals under his watch,” said Gu Su, a professor of philosophy and law at Nanjing University. “Anybody with basic economic knowledge knows they’re not viable.”
Xi now faces a dilemma, Gu said: Ignoring the promise would be equivalent to saying that the Communist Party failed, while proclaiming victory would only rile up a seething middle class that is increasingly venting frustration online. Anger over the initial response earlier this year — amplified by the death of a doctor who was reprimanded for speaking out about the virus — propelled “I want freedom of speech” to become the top-trending hashtag on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB).
Communist Party officials have sounded the alarm. In a nationwide teleconference on May 9, Public Security Minister Zhao Kezhi said the government should prioritize risks to China’s “political security.” He called on law enforcement to pay particular attention to “destabilizing factors” stemming from the economic downturn and the pandemic.
While Xi has invested heavily in tools to quash political dissidents, the party has frequently seen local protests erupt over bread-and-butter issues such as labor disputes, investment fraud and environmental disasters. Recently pockets of unrest have emerged in and around Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
Accounting for migrant workers who couldn’t travel to cities, job losses may have exceeded 50 million and the real unemployment rate could have hit 12% in March, according to BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY). As many as 130 million people were either out of work or furloughed in the first quarter.
What’s worse, only a small fraction of those are actually claiming welfare benefits due to a cumbersome application process and a meager amount of funds available.
China hasn’t confronted unemployment on this scale since 1990, when layoffs at state-owned enterprises led to protests and a spike in violent crime. Back then, the country quickly recovered as a wave of globalization allowed it to tap into a booming U.S. economy that fed demand for Chinese goods.
The situation now is very different. Growth was already slowing as the government sought to reduce debt, and U.S. President Donald Trump targeted exporters in an unprecedented trade war.
Any hope of a recovery is partially dependent on how quickly other world leaders are able to contain the virus and restart their economies. Nearly 200 million jobs in China come from businesses connected to foreign trade, Minister of Commerce Zhong Shan wrote in a recent article — more than the entire working population of the U.S.
Now China’s most powerful leader in decades, Xi recognizes the risks facing him as he maneuvers to extend his time in power beyond 2022 after doing away with term limits. For months, he’s warned that the virus might pose a risk to “social stability” in China.
His strategy so far has boiled down to three major things: Pump money into creating jobs, censor any dissenting views and redirect the anger on the ground with an appeal to nationalism. A Politburo meeting Friday, in which Xi reviewed a draft of Premier Li Keqiang’s annual report to the National People’s Congress, discussed measures to ensure social stability and employment in the face of “grim and complex” economic challenges.
So far at least, the strategy appears to be working on the ground. Dozens of residents in Guangdong who spoke with Bloomberg reporters last week were more focused on paying the next bill than hinting at a revolution to come.
In the provincial capital of Guangzhou, small business fronts were plastered with signs posted by renters seeking to sublet commercial spaces or even sell their businesses altogether. In one area called the Yinggao Trade City, most business units sat shuttered as international buyers stayed away and overseas demand plummeted.
Diego Lee, the marketing director of Kumpaya Im&Export Agent Co. Ltd, said business has been “terrible” in recent months: “No one wants anything except masks.” Still, he doesn’t blame the government, especially given the performance of the U.S. and Europe in handling the virus.
“If you look at the world, China has dealt with this better than anyone,” he said. “You have to listen to all these parties, but we just have one and everyone has to do what it says. If you want to walk your dog and the government says no, then you can’t walk your dog. You’ve lost some freedom, but you’re safe.”
In Dongguan, migrant workers who lost their jobs almost overnight were feeling the brunt of the impact. One who gave his surname as Xie lost his job at a furniture maker along with about 300 others — roughly 75% of the company’s employees.
“The virus came and there was no way to ship products out of the country,” Xie said as he sheltered from the drizzle outside an employment agency near the city center. He planned to head back to his hometown in neighboring Hunan province once he could find 200 yuan ($30) to get home.
Like others around him, Xie said he’s received no policy support or subsidies from government during this period. Around him, the sense of desperation is growing  — a far cry from the optimism surrounding China’s long-term plans to set up a high-tech export hub in the region.
A few doors down from Long’s textile workshop, an ecosystem of businesses were struggling to stay afloat. A man in his 60s surnamed Cai, whose company produces parts used in textile machines, said his business had already been reeling from the trade war before the pandemic hit. Now he’s on the brink of bankruptcy.
“I’m not making enough to get by,” Cai said. “I don’t know how much longer I can continue.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) said on Tuesday it will slow production of its stealthy F-35 fighter jets at its Texas facility, possibly delaying delivery of between 18 and 24 jets due to a parts shortage as the coronavirus hampers production across the jet's vast supply chain.
Greg Ulmer, who runs Lockheed Martin's F-35 program, told Reuters in an interview that ""we're going to slow the production rate down for about two to three months."" 
The virus' impact on defense production was foreshadowed by Ellen Lord, the Pentagon's chief weapon's buyer, who in April said she anticipated that major weapons programs would experience a three-month delay.
Companies that make parts for the structural components of the jet aircraft are having to slow production due to the virus, Ulmer said.
The company said in a statement it expects the financial impact ""to be consistent with what we've reported previously,"" and that they will share any new information during the next earnings call.
Ulmer cautioned that it was too soon to say the company would not meet its delivery target of 141 F-35 jets, ""because we have the ability to surge, and we'll be working with our suppliers to do everything we can to come out of this on the backside strong.""
Lockheed Martin has exceeded its 2019 goal of 131 F-35 deliveries by 3 jets.
The parts slowdown began in early to mid-April, when European suppliers began to feel the impacts of the coronavirus. Later, suppliers in the U.S. were impacted, Ulmer said.
The slower production schedule will begin on May 23.
Ulmer said the slowdown could last through late-July, but could be extended or shortened depending on suppliers.

F-35 assembly facilities in Japan and Italy were both impacted by COVID-19 earlier this year.

The news publication's report https:// pulled down shares of the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech and erased modest gains on the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX).
Moderna said on Monday the vaccine candidate, the first to be tested in the United States, produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers.
The news, while based on initial data from just eight people and not intended to assess the vaccine's efficacy, nevertheless sent Moderna shares up 20% on Monday, and also pushed the broader markets higher.
Moderna later announced a stock sale that could raise about $1.5 billion, sending shares lower early on Tuesday.
Stat quoted health experts saying that Moderna had not provided enough data in its news release to judge the vaccine candidate.
Issues noted by Stat included:
- a lack of data about the responses to the medicine from other participants in the 45-subject study
- lack of information about the ages of the eight subjects whose antibodies were analyzed, an important question given the virus is particularly lethal to older people 
- lack of comment from Moderna's U.S. government partner on the vaccine, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases
- the data is based on early responses to the vaccine, leaving unclear how long any immunity produced by the vaccine might last.
Moderna did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday it would require  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and other aircraft manufacturers to adopt new safety-management tools following two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people.
The plan to begin the regulatory process to mandate Safety Management Systems (SMS) comes in response to recommendations released in January by an expert panel named by Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.
The panel did not back ending a long-standing practice of delegating some certification tasks to aircraft manufacturers. Boeing grounded its entire 737 Max fleet after an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed in March 2019.
SMS systems are mandated for airlines. The special committee report said ""SMSs foster a holistic assessment of whether the combinations of actions such as design, procedures, and training work together to counter potential hazards.""
Boeing's safety culture was harshly criticized in January after it released hundreds of internal messages about the development of the 737 MAX, including one that said the plane was ""designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys.""
Boeing, which halted production in January, is addressing two software issues before it can move to a key certification test flight. Reuters has reported the 737 MAX is expected to remain grounded until at least August.
""To further strengthen our safety culture, Boeing is working with the FAA to implement a safety management system,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday.
U.S. House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio said in December his panel's review found ""a broken safety culture within Boeing and an FAA that was unknowing, unable or unwilling to step up, regulate, and provide appropriate oversight of Boeing.""

The report said FAA should address ""concerns about potential undue pressure"" on Boeing employees conducting FAA certification tasks. The FAA said it would ""systemically address any actual undue pressure.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Tuesday reiterated its policy that all visitors to its manufacturing plants must wear a mask but said the White House will ultimately decide if U.S. President Donald Trump will comply during a planned visit.
Trump plans to visit a Ford plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on Thursday that is being used to manufacture ventilators. Ford issued a revised statement late on Tuesday that signaled it may allow Trump to violate a policy it spent weeks locking in to allow it to operate its plants safely.
Asked whether he will wear a mask when he visits Ford, Trump said that ""where it's appropriate I would do it."" The decision depends on the situation and if he ""standing right next to everybody,"" he added.
""Our policy is that everyone wears PPE to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" Ford spokeswoman Rachel McCleery said on Tuesday. ""The White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination.""
The company's policy handbook to address the coronavirus pandemic, released May 1, says flatly that face masks must be worn ""at all times"" at U.S. manufacturing plants by all employees and ""all visitors.""
McCleery said the company ""shared all of Ford’s safety protocols, including our manufacturing playbook, employee pamphlet and self-assessment survey with the White House ahead of time and in preparation for this trip.""
Last week, Trump toured a mask distribution center in Pennsylvania but did not wear a mask.
The United Auto Workers and the Detroit Three automakers held talks about safety protocols to allow for Monday's resumption of auto production.

Air Canada (TO:AC), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) executives also spoke at the conference.
Pre-pandemic passenger levels will be slow to return, they said, depending on development of a vaccine and the broader re-opening of businesses, restaurants, hotels and theme parks.
U.S. domestic load factors will likely remain below 75% next year, they said.
Delta CFO Paul Jacobson said it could be three years before the sector sees ""normalized demand"" and questioned whether customers would want to fly on full planes before a vaccine.
That does not mean that airlines are considering changing airplanes' seating configuration, which would be a multi-year certification process, United executives said.
""I'm confident we'll be on the other side of this situation by the time we could do anything even close to that,"" United Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Nocella said.
U.S. airline shares rose on Tuesday.
REBUILDING BALANCE SHEETS
Executives said they were now focused on reducing daily cash burns to become cash flow positive in 2021.
Delta thinks it will reach cash flow break-even by the end of this year, said Jacobson, who sees daily cash burn slowing to about $40 million by the end of June as the airline restores around 100 flights to its schedule.
Jacobson said he expected any necessary headcount changes at Delta could be done through voluntary programs.
American Airlines CFO Derek Kerr told the conference his company would need to ""right-size"" to ensure positive cash flow next year, with all excess cash used to pay off debt for the next five years. American, which invested heavily in renovating its fleet, has the highest debt load of the U.S. majors.
Air Canada CFO Mike Rousseau said he could not predict when his airline's cash burn would go to zero, noting it will depend on revenue performance in the coming months.
Separately, Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said its June capacity would be roughly half its schedule a year ago -- an improvement from a 60% to 70% reduction in May. It projected its daily cash burn will slow to the low-$20 million range in June.

United, with more international exposure, said earlier that its June capacity would still be down by about 90% year-on-year, and 75% in July. Its total adjusted capital expenditure for 2021 would be close to $2 billion versus around $4.5 billion this year, it said, falling to below $500 million in 2022 when it does not expect to take delivery of any new aircraft. It is taking fully financed jet deliveries this year and next.
