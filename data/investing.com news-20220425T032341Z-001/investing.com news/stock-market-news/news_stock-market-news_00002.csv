0,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 03:05AM ET</span>",Marketmind: King cash is naked,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus.
Storing wealth in cash is clearly a counter-intuitive call when inflation is surging towards double-digit figures for the first time in a generation. 
Yet, many investors are doing just that: BoFA said $13.2 billion was moved into cash last week and cash positions by fund managers earlier this month reached their highest levels since the pandemic market crash of March 2020.
BofA analysts also warned that commodity prices were on track for their biggest increase in over a century while government bonds were set for their worst year since 1949 as central banks raise interest rates to tame surging inflation. 
With equity markets losing more than 5% so far this quarter, many investors may feel vindicated in deserting risky stock markets where dividends and capital gains are looking less attractive compared to fast-rising government bond yields. 
Yields on 10-year Treasuries have risen nearly 40% so far this month to 2.5% while in Germany, the Bund is closing to 0.6% and moving further away from negative territory which was its home for the past three years. 
The war in Ukraine, hard-pressured supply chains, a resurgent pandemic amid buoyant inflation is making this monetary tightening cycle particularly hard to manoeuvre.
The picture, this last Monday morning of March 2022, is blurry as ever. 
The yen extended its descent to a six-year low after the Bank of Japan stepped into the market to stop government bond yields from rising and Asian shares retreated as a coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai weighed on sentiment.
Oil prices are falling about $5 amid fears of weaker demand from China but are still at levels unseen since 2014.
Some answers on the direction of travel from here are expected this week with surveys on global manufacturing, inflation readings and U.S. job data. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday: 
- German exporters' morale slumps on war in Ukraine
- China industrial profits up, but mired in single-digit growth

- Central bank speakers: Andrea Enria, chair of the supervisory board of the ECB, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, Norway Central Bank Deputy Governor Oystein Borsum

""We are considering investment in companies ranging from those that are big in scale to those that are small,"" Co-CEO of SK Hynix Park Jung-ho, who is also CEO of SK Square, said at the latter's annual shareholders meeting.

The drug, branded as Fintepla, already has the U.S. approval to treat another form of childhood-onset epilepsy, Davet Syndrome (DS), in patients aged two years and older.
LGS causes cognitive dysfunction and frequent seizures that often lead to injury, and UCB's  Zogenix  (NASDAQ:ZGNX) unit estimates that about 30,000 to 50,000 people have the syndrome in the United States.
The FDA approval was supported by safety and efficacy data from a Phase 3 clinical trial in 263 patients with LGS, the biotech firm said in a statement.
Developed by Zogenix, Fintepla is available only through a restricted drug distribution program in the United States.
California-based Zogenix was acquired by UCB in a deal worth about $2 billion, which closed earlier this month.
Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia forecast worldwide peak sales for Fintepla of about $300 million by 2030 from the LGS indication alone, and of about $800 million in total from both the indications.
Fintepla adjusts a receptor called Sigma 1, which controls how brain cells communicate with each other. The drug comes with a boxed warning for heart and lung conditions such as valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.
The FDA approval pits Fintepla against  Jazz Pharmaceuticals  (NASDAQ:JAZZ)' cannabis-based drug, Epidiolex, which is U.S.-approved to treat seizures related to Dravet Syndrome and LGS.
In a late-stage study, Fintepla showed average reduction in the frequency of seizures by 39.4% at three months. Epidiolex showed a 44% reduction in seizure frequency over a similar period in its study.
Fintepla's relatively higher pricing and undifferentiated data in LGS could restrict its use to patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy, Kapadia said.

""In the DS indication it is clear that Fintepla is a superior product, but I think that's less true for the LGS indication.""
Other drugs, which could potentially add to the competition for Fintepla include Takeda Pharmaceutical's soticlestat and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY)'s lorcaserin and Fycompa.

(Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions in Germany in the first three months of 2022 have dropped 10% from the same period in 2021 in what has been the slowest start to a year since 2016 due to market uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Equity capital markets in the euro zone's biggest economy have been hit harder as market jitters have led to a total dearth of deals with no initial public offerings (IPOs) or convertible offerings recorded so far this year, according to Refinitiv data.
""It is unlikely that companies will choose to list before Easter, even unlikely before the summer given current market conditions,"" said Armin von Falkenhayn, head of corporate and investment banking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). 
German equity capital markets raised only $1 billion so far this year, down 88% compared with the first quarter of 2021.
But appetite for M&A deals remains strong even if boardrooms have become more risk-averse.
""Unlike at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, the M&A market has definitely not come to a standstill and projects are continuing. But parties are examining very carefully how the conflict may affect each company,"" said Tibor Kossa, co-head of German and Austrian M&A at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
While the Ukraine crisis has affected only around 1-2% of German companies' sales, ""the war and its longer-term consequences absorb a lot of management capacity,"" said Berthold Mueller, chairman of DACH investment banking at Jefferies. 
Yet amid prevailing caution to begin new processes, some auctions that were launched before the war managed to get to the finish line.
One such example was Siemens' $1.3 billion carve-out of its mail and parcel logistics business, which was sold to Hamburg-based Koerber in February and led to consumer products and services accounting for one-third of German target M&A in the first quarter.
Other deals in the technology sector contributed to 31% of German target M&A including the purchase by Italian infrastructure and transport services firm Atlantia of Siemens' traffic software solutions business, Yunex.
Strong growth in the technology sector contributed to an increase in mid-market deal activity to its highest year-to-date total since 2015, according to Refinitiv data.
""Private equity remains open to acquisitions and transactions can continue to be funded,"" said Christopher Droege, co-head of German and Austrian M&A at Goldman Sachs.
EYES ON TRANSATLANTIC TIE-UPS
One sector that seems resilient to the backdrop of war is telecommunications – arguably a necessity for information flow in times of crisis.
Earlier this month, Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) launched the sale of its towers business and is collecting indicative offers together with adviser Goldman Sachs, in a deal that could value the business at close to 18 billion euros ($19.86 billion).
Dealmakers say there are intense dialogues with corporate clients as well as private equity and the deal pipeline for the rest of the year looks intact.
Transatlantic tie-ups could increase as the European landscape becomes more challenging.
""In the future we expect that German companies looking for takeovers will orient themselves increasingly towards North America since the growth gap between Europe and the United States is likely to widen further in the current environment,"" Goldman's Kossa said.
Nevertheless, dealmaking during wartime remains hard to stomach for some parties that prefer to wait for peacetime.

""A buyer cannot go before their board of directors and pretend this war does not exist. The question is how long this situation will last. That is why many companies tend to wait until the situation clears up,"" said Jefferies' Mueller.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a cautious manner Monday, as investors keep a wary eye on developments in the war between Ukraine and Russia with peace talks set to take place in Turkey this week.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.3%.
The war in Ukraine is now entering its second month and has resulted in the devastation of several cities, caused a major humanitarian crisis, and displaced an estimated 10 million people, nearly a quarter of Ukraine's population.
That said, Russia has failed to seize any major Ukrainian city and risks being drawn into guerrilla warfare, something Moscow would be keen to avoid, given previous difficulties in Afghanistan.
New in-person peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are set to take place in Turkey this week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address to his country on Sunday that his government would prioritize the ""territorial integrity"" of Ukraine, but hopes are rising that a compromise over the status of the eastern Donbas region could be reached as part of a peace deal.
Meanwhile, the U.S. quickly backtracked from President Joe Biden’s comments that Vladimir Putin “cannot remain in power,” with Secretary of State Antony Blinken clarifying that his country does not have a strategy for regime change.
The economic data slate is largely empty in Europe Monday, with most attention on the monthly U.S. employment report due at the end of the week as this could help markets get a sense of whether the Fed’s roadmap for rate hikes is realistic.
Back in Europe, the Financial Times reported on Sunday that the chief executive of Daimler Truck (OTC:DDAIF) said electric truck costs would ""forever be higher"" than those using combustion engines, putting the EV market into the spotlight.
Oil prices slumped Monday on fears of reduced demand from China, the world’s largest crude importer, as a surge in COVID-19 cases prompted the country’s officials to instigate a two-stage lockdown at its financial hub of Shanghai.
All firms and factories in Shanghai would suspend manufacturing or have people work remotely in a two-stage lockdown, closing half the city in turns, over nine days. Public transport, including ride-hailing services, will also be suspended.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.6% lower at $109.80 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 3.3% to $113.52. 
Oil is still heading for a fourth monthly gain after Russia, the world's second-largest crude exporter, invaded Ukraine, prompting fears of disruptions to global supplies, driving prices above $100 a barrel. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 1% to $1,934.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% lower at 1.0951."

Investing.com – Chinese food delivery provider Meituan (HK:3690) impressed in its results for the fourth quarter of 2021, reporting a net loss of CNY 5.3 billion ($832.38 million) versus the CNY7.2 billion forecast by analysts. Revenue rose 31%, the slowest in more than a year, to CNY49.5 billion, and met estimates.
The company’s Hong Kong shares soared 14% to HK$153.9 ($19.66) by 1:25 AM ET (5:25 AM GMT). The stocks snapped a two-day loss to become the best performer on the Hang Seng Tech Index on Monday.
Meituan is one of the Chinese technology giants under regulatory scrutiny in areas from the welfare of its delivery riders to the commissions it charges restaurants. It is also under pressure to share its wealth as part of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s “common prosperity” drive, with the country facing its latest COVID-19 outbreak.
The government in February issued a call to aid the service industry, asking food delivery platforms to cut the fees they charge restaurants and wiping $26 billion off Meituan’s value in a single day. The city of Shanghai also entered a nine-day lockdown earlier in the day.
“Meituan’s fourth-quarter boost in food-delivery margin from a persistent increase in transactions could alleviate concerns about the drag from government-initiated fee cuts, meant to provide relief to merchants amid Covid-19 flare-up, to the unit’s first-half profitability. The company needs to raise first half transaction volume by at least 14% to yield more cost savings, we calculate, while lifting food-delivery margin above the year-earlier level following fee adjustments,” according to Bloomberg analysts Catherine Lim and Tiffany Tam."

(Reuters - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV+ made history on Sunday as the first streaming service to win a best picture Oscar for ""CODA,” a heartwarming drama about the daughter of deaf parents who pursues her passion for music.
The streaming service purchased ""CODA"" for a record $25 million following its debut in 2021 at the Sundance Film Festival, and it has gathered momentum throughout the awards season, winning top honors from the Producers Guild, Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild awards. 
""CODA"" faced intense competition from Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX)'s critically acclaimed western, ""The Power of the Dog,"" which collected a dozen nominations. The film's director, Jane Campion, received an Academy Award. 
The best picture Oscar signals how far the industry has come since 2017, when the Cannes film festival prohibited movies that were not released on the big screen from competing for its most prestigious prize, the Palme d’Or. It was a deliberate snub to streaming services like Netflix.
As the global pandemic forced theaters to close in 2020, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences modified its Oscar eligibility rules to temporarily change the requirement that a movie screen for seven days in theaters to qualify. That represented a watershed moment for movies that debut via streaming services in the home.
The best picture Oscar also marks a milestone for Apple TV+, which launched in November 2019 with a handful of original series and no library of movies and TV shows. 

Apple TV+ saw a breakthrough in September 2021, when its fish-out-of-water comedy, ""Ted Lasso,"" about an American football coach who takes a job with an English soccer club, received the Emmy Award for outstanding comedy series.
""If Apple was to win the coveted best picture award with CODA it would catalyze more A+ talent coming to Apple first (or in the top bracket)"" and boost subscriptions, Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote before the awards.

7,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 28, 2022 12:45AM ET</span>","China, U.S. working hard on solution to audit dispute - state media","SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Chinese regulators and their U.S. counterparts are working hard to solve an audit dispute affecting U.S.-listed Chinese firms and want to achieve effective and sustainable cooperation as soon as possible, a state-run newspaper reported on Sunday. 
Citing a source close to Chinese regulators, the official China Securities Journal reported that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) heard opinions from some U.S.-listed Chinese companies during an online meeting on Sunday. 
""Both Chinese and U.S. regulators are fully aware of each other's concerns, and are moving toward each other, and working hard to find solutions to the issue in order to achieve effective and sustainable cooperation as soon as possible,"" the source was cited as saying.
""This is in the best interests of the capital markets of both countries and global investors."" 
CSRC said that the recent talks with U.S. regulators have been efficient, candid, and professional, the newspaper said.
The comments come days after the U.S. public company accounting regulator said that recent media speculation about an imminent deal with China was ""premature"", and it remained unclear if the Chinese government would grant the access required by a new U.S. listing law.
Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms - a long-simmering auditing dispute that puts hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments at stake.
The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks some of China's biggest tech companies including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), jumped 3.6% on Monday morning, compared with a 1.3% gain in the benchmark index Hang Seng.
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES 
But some analysts and investors remain sceptical that a solution will be found.
""Significant differences exist between the US and Chinese regulators,"" Hao Hong, head of research at BOCOM International, wrote on Monday. ""Many US-listed Chinese companies will face delisting eventually."" 
U.S. regulators require disclosure of government interest in the listed companies, as well as sensitive information and data, while the Chinese government ""has been tightening its control on many of China's biggest and most important companies,"" he added.
To avert the delisting risk, New York-based asset manager Krane Funds Advisors said earlier this month that its $4.9 billion KraneShare CSI China Internet ETF aims to convert all Chinese American Depository Receipts (ADRs) in its portfolio into their Hong Kong shares in the coming months. 
Chinese regulators have asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms, including Alibaba, Baidu and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, to prepare for more audit disclosures as Beijing steps up efforts to ensure they remain listed in New York, Reuters reported last week.

The Financial Times and Bloomberg News also reported this month that China's securities watchdog is weighing a proposal that would allow U.S. regulators to inspect auditors' working papers for some companies as soon as this year.
CSRC cautioned market participants not to blindly believe in speculation by some media with little knowledge of the details and direction of the talks, as such reports caused unnecessary disturbances to market expectations, the China Securities Journal reported on Sunday.

Liu Yongzhuo, president of the electric vehicle (EV) arm of the world's most indebted property developer China Evergrande Group, made the comment at an online meeting attended by nearly 200 global parts suppliers on Sunday, according to the firm's official Wechat account. The social media post didn't say exactly when the firm will start taking orders.
The plan comes as the EV firm has been struggling to secure external investment. Evergrande told investors in a call last week it was trying to rope in investors to help bolster the unit's finances - a goal it has been pursuing for months without much success.
Evergrande New Energy Vehicle said in November it had been negotiating with potential buyers regarding the disposal of some assets and talking to potential investors about funding.

Evergrande chairman Hui Ka Yan said at an internal meeting last week that the EV company will start mass production on June 22, after getting approval from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to start sales earlier this month.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Monday morning, as the war in Ukraine sparked by Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24 enters a second month. The risk of an economic downturn from tightening U.S. monetary policy is also weighing on markets.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.41% by 11:27 PM ET (3:27 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI inched up 0.07%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 gained 0.45%.

China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.19% while the ShenzhenComponent fell 0.68%, with Shanghai locking down to curb rising numbers of COVID-19 cases.
U.S. Treasuries were mixed after a bond rout, triggered by fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest-rate hikes to curb inflation. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell but remained above a technical trend line that has effectively served as a ceiling since the late 1980s. Bonds also fell in Australia and New Zealand.
Commodities supply chains continue to be disrupted by the war in Ukraine, alongside the trend towards tighter central bank monetary policies. Investors are pricing in two full percentage points of Fed rate rises for the rest of the year, which has led to further volatility in the stocks, bonds and currencies markets.
“The Fed is trying to create a Goldilocks scenario by engineering a soft landing,” Nuveen chief investment officer Saira Malik told Bloomberg. “The equity markets are buying it and the bond markets aren’t.”
Malik added she expects only a moderate impact on global growth from the war, as economic expansion will be strong enough to overcome inflation.

(Reuters) -Australia's Star Entertainment Group said on Monday its chief executive officer Matt Bekier had tendered his resignation, amid an investigation over possible breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws at its casinos. 
The casino operator's shares, which have fallen over 12% already this year, were down as much as 1.9%. 
Bekier informed the board that as managing director and CEO, he is ""accountable for the effectiveness and adequacy of the company's processes, policies, people and culture,"" adding that the right thing to do was for him to take responsibility, a company statement said.
Bekier's decision to step down, effective immediately, followed issues raised at the public hearings in connection with the ongoing review of the Star Sydney hotel and casino, the company added in a statement. The Star Sydney is Australia's second largest casino.
The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) had launched a probe in June last year into Star's casino in Sydney amid concerns over ongoing customer due diligence and compliance with laws.
Local media also had reported on a confidential review that accused Star of failure to curb fraud and money laundering at its two resorts.
""If Crown Resorts is a guide, we have a long way to go which could involve further management/board change and the now, very real possibility of Star losing its licence to operate, which could conceivably dash plans for an additional 1,000 Electronic Gaming Machines in Sydney,"" Jefferies analysts wrote in a note.

Last week, an inquiry had declared rival casino operator Crown Resorts unfit for a gambling licence in Western Australia state, but stopped short of revoking it. 
Bekier, who was also previously the chief financial officer of Star, will work with the board to transition his executive responsibilities, the company added. His final departure date is yet to be determined.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Sunday reinstated a sharp increase in penalties for automakers whose vehicles do not meet fuel efficiency requirements for model years 2019 and beyond.
The decision was a win for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) that could cost other automakers hundreds of millions of dollars or more.
Confirming an earlier report by Reuters, NHTSA said https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2022-03/2022-03-25%20CAFE%20Penalties%20FR%20-%20Website%20Version_0.pdf the decision ""increases the accountability of manufacturers for violating the nation’s fuel economy standards"" and the penalty increase ""incentivizes manufacturers to make fuel economy improvements.""
President Donald Trump's administration in its final days in January 2021 delayed a 2016 regulation that more than doubled penalties for automakers failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements starting in the 2019 model year. 
NHTSA's final rule, which takes effect 60 days after it is published, reinstated the higher penalties and boosted them further for the 2022 model year. The agency has not collected penalties for 2019 to 2021 model years while the issue was under review and is the subject of court challenges.
The final rule was signed on Thursday by NHTSA's top official, Steven Cliff, ahead of its formal publication.
For the 2019 to 2021 model years, the fine is $14, up from $5.50, for every 0.1 mile per gallon new vehicles fall short of required fuel-economy standards, multiplied by the number of noncomplying vehicles sold. For the 2022 model year, this rises to $15. 
Automakers protested the penalty hike in 2016, warning it could raise industry costs by at least $1 billion annually. The decision is expected to cost Chrysler parent Stellantis, for instance, as much as $572 million by the company's prior estimates, while boosting the value of compliance credits sold by Tesla.
Automakers whose vehicles achieve higher fuel economy than required can sell credits to automakers that do not meet CAFE rules.
Under President Barack Obama, the higher penalties were set to start with the 2019 model year, but the Trump administration set the effective date as the 2022 model year following a court decision.
NHTSA estimated that for the 2019 model year, automakers would owe $294 million at the new rate, up from $115.4 million under the prior rate. 
NHTSA added automakers that made plans for 2019 through 2021 ""thinking that penalties would not increase did so at their own risk.""
The head of a trade group representing nearly all major automakers except Tesla said Sunday it would be a ""better outcome"" if the penalties ""were invested in electric vehicles, batteries and charging infrastructure instead of disappearing into the general fund of the Treasury.""
In August, NHTSA proposed hiking CAFE requirements by 8% annually for 2024 through 2026, reversing a Trump-era regulation that rolled back higher requirements starting in the 2021 model year. NHTSA is expected to issue its final CAFE rules through 2026 this week.
On Sunday, Stellantis said it would ""like to work with the administration and Congress to allow the agencies to use the proceeds from penalties to bolster investments in the technologies and infrastructure required to accelerate a robust U.S. market for EVs.""

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Congress in 2015 ordered federal agencies to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation. U.S. fuel economy fines lost 75% of their original value, having risen only once since 1975 - from $5 to $5.50 in 1997.

Scottish Widows, part of Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY), said this added a further 1.5 billion pounds ($2 billion) to its exclusions, bringing total divestments from firms deemed to pose a threat to the pension provider's environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals to 3 billion pounds. 
The firm said it would not invest in any company deriving more than 10% of its revenue from tobacco, which it said meant excluding all tobacco manufacturers and major distributors.
""Industries such as tobacco are at severe risk of becoming stranded assets, as they face intense pressure from investors, regulators and consumers, and consistently fail to properly address the social impacts of their products and within their supply chain,"" said Maria Nazarova-Doyle, Scottish Widows head of pension investments and responsible investments.
Scottish Widows, which has 190 billion pounds in assets under administration, also said it would lower the threshold for investing in firms extracting thermal coal and tar sands, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, to 5% of revenue from 10%. 
The shift out of tobacco follows similar moves by financial institutions such as Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) and  Aviva  (LON:AV). 

Insurers and investors such as Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) have also been tightening their policies towards fossil fuels, as firms focus increasingly on environmentally sustainable investments.

LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's shareholders are set to vote on a resolution at this year's annual meeting calling for Britain's second biggest supermarket group to commit to paying the so called real Living Wage to all its workers by July 2023.
Responsible investment group ShareAction, which is co-ordinating the move, said on Monday the resolution has been filed by an investor coalition managing 2.2 trillion pounds ($2.9 trillion) that includes Legal and General Investment Management, Fidelity International, HSBC Asset Management and Nest.
It is the first resolution calling for a listed firm to become a Living Wage accredited employer.
The real Living Wage is established by the Living Wage Foundation and independently calculated by the Resolution Foundation according to how much workers and their families need to live.
The rates are currently 11.05 pounds ($14.58) per hour in London and 9.90 pounds per hour in the rest of the United Kingdom.
That compares to Britain's main government-mandated minimum wage rate of 8.91 pounds an hour, which is due to rise 6.6% to 9.50 pounds an hour on April 1.
In January, Sainsbury's, one of the UK's biggest private sector employers, set new pay rates for directly employed workers that will see it hit the real Living Wage for staff in inner London and outside the capital.
However, its rate of 10.50 pounds for workers in outer London fell short of the real Living Wage for that region.
It did not make any commitment relating to the pay of third-party staff, such as cleaners and security guards.
""Furthermore, Sainsbury’s have made no commitment that pay will continue to increase in line with the cost of living in future years.  Accrediting as a Living Wage employer would remove this uncertainty and guarantee all workers a wage that they can live on,"" ShareAction said.
A spokesperson for Sainsbury's said colleague feedback from its pay review had been positive and it had to balance the needs of all its stakeholders. 
""It is vital that we not only pay our colleagues fairly but that we are able to invest significantly to offer customers great value,"" said the spokesperson.

Sainsbury's annual shareholders meeting will be held on July 7.

(Reuters) -  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) has turned down a settlement offer from Alta Fox Capital Management LLC to have only one of its nominees added to the U.S. toy maker's board of directors, making a shareholder vote over the dispute likely, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The two sides have been discussing how to avert a proxy contest after Alta Fox, a hedge fund that holds a 2.5% stake in Hasbro, nominated five directors to the company's eleven-member board last month. 
Alta Fox has privately indicated to Hasbro, the maker of Dungeons & Dragons and Play-Doh, that it would settle for two new directors, as long as one of them is one of the five Alta Fox nominees, and a board committee focused on capital allocation, the sources said. 
Hasbro, however, has rejected giving any of the Alta Fox nominees a board seat, the sources added. The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company has indicated to Alta Fox that it believes it can replenish its board with directors of a higher caliber and more relevant experience than the Alta Fox nominees, the sources added.
It is still possible that the two sides reach a compromise before Hasbro's annual shareholder meeting where shareholders will vote on the board's composition, the sources said. That meeting is expected to take place in the spring. 
The sources requested anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations between the two side. 
Hasbro said in a statement it is committed to engaging with all shareholders and has held ""multiple conversations"" with Alta Fox to listen to its views and ""attempt to come to a resolution of this campaign."" 
""We are disappointed the board refuses to listen to its shareholders and appears more interested in forcing a contest than agreeing to a reasonable settlement that investors would support,"" an Alta Fox representative said.
Alta Fox, a firm founded four years ago by hedge fund veteran Connor Haley, has called on Hasbro to consider spinning off its prominent Wizards of the Coast unit to boost its lagging share price. The unit, which publishes Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering, saw its revenue grow 42% in 2021, according to Hasbro.    The investment firm argued Hasbro's ""ineffective"" Brand Blueprint strategy, including ""ill-advised acquisitions"" like the 2019 purchase of Entertainment One for $4.6 billion, is holding it back and that its share price could surge to $200 a share in the next three years with ""corrective action."" 

Hasbro shares closed at $84.88 on Friday after hitting their lowest level in the last 52 weeks on Thursday, and they are down more than 10% over the past five years.Alta Fox has said its supports Chris Cocks, who took over as Hasbro's CEO last month after leading the Wizards of the Coast unit, but that he should be surrounded by a ""meaningfully refreshed board.""  
Hasbro has said it has a ""highly qualified, independent, experienced and engaged board.""

In votes Thursday and Friday at General Motors in the city of Ramos Arizpe in the border state of Coahuila, several thousand workers cast ballots to keep ties with the Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), the union said on Sunday.
Contract ratification votes are required under Mexico's 2019 labor reform, which underpins a new trade deal with the United States and Canada, to ensure workers are not bound to contracts that were signed behind their backs, hampering them from demanding better pay.
In the global propulsion systems area of the GM plant, 94% of 1,379 votes cast were in favor of the contract, as were 96% of 2,657 ballots cast in the larger assembly area, CTM said in a statement. 
More than 4,500 employees were eligible to vote at the 40-year-old plant, which produces Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox cars as well as two engine types. 
General Motors did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 

The outcome marks a stark contrast from a vote at a larger GM plant in the central Mexican city of Silao last year where several thousand workers rejected their contract with CTM, a process closely watched by the U.S. government after allegations of irregularities.
In February the Silao workers elected an independent union, SINTTIA, opening the door to the prospect of bigger pay rises.

Auchan, which has around 30,000 staff, 231 stores and e-commerce activities in Russia, has already been criticised by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for remaining operational in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine.
In the interview published on Sunday, Auchan's chief executive Yves Claude said he feared the company risked losing assets or exposing local managers to potential legal troubles if it pulled out of Russia. 
The firm would also remain in Ukraine, Claude said, where its 43 supermarkets and around 6,000 staff, including in regions hit by the war, were operating under ""extreme conditions"".
""The most important in our eyes is to maintain our employees and ensure our primary mission, which is to continue feeding the populations of these two countries,"" Claude said.
Responding to the report, Ukraine's foreign minister called for a boycott of Auchan and all of its products.
""Apparently, job losses in Russia are more important than the loss of life in Ukraine,"" Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Ukrainian President Zelenskiy has said it was necessary that all Western companies leave the Russian market and do not cover their ""thirst for profit"" through ""cheap"" communication, explicitly citing Auchan and Swiss food giant Nestle.

The company generated 3.2 billion euros in sales in Russia last year, around 10% of its global sales, and expects losses this year in that market.
Moscow says the goals for what Putin calls a ""special military operation"" include demilitarising and ""denazifying"" its neighbour. Ukraine and its Western allies calls this a pretext for an unprovoked invasion.

23,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2022 08:05AM ET</span>",Grocery workers vote to strike if needed in southern California for higher wages,"(Reuters) - Around 48,000 grocery workers voted to strike if needed when seeking higher wages from stores owned by Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Albertsons Companies Inc in Southern California, the UFCW 770 union said on Saturday.
The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) has been seeking significantly higher and equal pay, sufficient staffing and enough working hours in their negotiations with the grocers, which began on Jan. 28.
As U.S. food prices rise, workers are pushing big corporations that have been posting record profits to offer more.
Politicians including President Joe Biden and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have voiced support for such demands.
The union said in a statement it would notify workers if a decision were made to strike.
It said there was a big disconnect between its proposal and the offer of an hourly raise of 60 cents, or less than a 1% increase, made by the grocers, including Ralphs, Albertsons, Pavilions and Vons.
Kroger-owned Ralphs called the union's proposal unrealistic as it is expensive to do business in California, while proposing to maintain its nearly $133 million annual investment in health care benefits.
The grocer, which has around 190 stores in California, said it might start making contingency plans, including advertising for temporary workers, to keep its business running.
As the previous workers' contract expired on March 6, the labor union has slapped unfair labor practice charges against the grocers.
The union said bargaining would resume on Wednesday and if talks failed, it would decide on the next steps.
It warned the workers not to walk out until it notified them and said it would have strike benefit funds available to support members if the companies forced the union to take action.

Ralphs said on Monday it hoped the union would return to the bargaining table with renewed interest in reaching a balanced deal.
Albertsons did not respond to a request for comment.

The country's largest healthcare provider, Clalit Health Services, said the 40-day study included more than half a million people aged 60 to 100.
Some 58% of participants had received a second booster - or two shots in addition to the basic two-shot regimen. The remainder had received only one booster. Researchers recorded 92 deaths among the first group and 232 deaths among the second, smaller group.
""The main conclusion is that the second booster is lifesaving,"" said Ronen Arbel, Health Outcomes Researcher at Clalit and Sapir College.

The report was issued as a preprint and has not been peer-reviewed. The research excluded people who received rival  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccine and those who had taken oral anti-COVID therapy.

Investors have also raised concerns with new Chair Axel Lehmann over the bank's decision not to publish a report into the lender's failings around the collapse of Greensill last year, the paper said.
Credit Suisse racked up a 1.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.72 billion) loss as a result of the collapse of $10 billion in supply chain finance funds linked to Greensill and a $5.5 billion hit from the implosion of investment fund Archegos.
Under Swiss corporate rules, directors can be held responsible for wilful or grossly negligent violations of their duties, with shareholders asked each year to free them from legal liabilities for the previous year. 
Approving the vote waives the directors' or management's liabilities, but only applies to facts that have been disclosed to shareholders and the claims of the company and shareholders who approved it.
""How can we let them off the hook when we don't know the full details of what happened?"" one shareholder told the FT.
Switzerland's second-largest bank has been working to recover assets from the collapse of Greensill.
The bank said last month it had recovered $7.3 billion in the funds that it suspended in March 2021 and has filed a total of 11 insurance claims.
The bank is due to publish its agenda for the AGM in the coming days. A spokesperson declined to comment to Reuters on Sunday.
Credit Suisse commissioned Swiss lawyers Walder Wyss and accountants Deloitte to investigate the case.

The report they produced has been completed and shared with the bank's board and Swiss financial watchdog FINMA, but ""in light of the ongoing recovery process and the legal complexities of the matter, there is no intention by the Board to publish the report,"" the bank said in February.

The letter Z has been used as a marking on Russian military vehicles taking part in the conflict and has been adopted by Russians supporting the war, with it being prominent on flags and at pro-Kremlin rallies.

Moscow has described its actions in Ukraine as a ""special military operation.""
Zurich Insurance said earlier this month that it was no longer taking on new domestic customers in Russia and will not renew existing local business.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Saturday named the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) safety chief as the acting leader of the agency effective Friday.
Billy Nolen, who in December was named the FAA's associate administrator for aviation safety, had previously been vice president for safety, security and quality for WestJet Airlines in Canada.
Nolen, who started his career as an American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) pilot, will replace FAA administrator Steve Dickson, who is stepping down on March 31, until the White House nominates a permanent successor.
""Billy Nolen has extensive expertise in aviation and a deep understanding of the vital role the FAA plays in ensuring the safety of the traveling public,” said U.S Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.
Nolen leads a team of more than 7,600 FAA employees. The FAA’s safety efforts and oversight of Boeing (NYSE:BA) have come under fire after two fatal 737 MAX crashes in a five-month period killed 346 people and led to the plane's 20-month grounding. Congress in December 2020 passed legislation to reform how the FAA certifies new airplanes and delegates some duties to manufacturers like Boeing.
Dickson, 64, is resigning about halfway through his five-year term. The Biden administration ""is conducting a national search for a nominee to become the permanent FAA administrator,"" the FAA said Saturday.
Dickson headed the FAA as it oversaw a comprehensive review of the then-grounded Boeing 737 MAX. He took a hard line, warning in late 2019 that Boeing was pursuing ""a return-to-service schedule that is not realistic.""
Earlier this week, the FAA warned Boeing it may not gain certification of a lengthened version of the 737 MAX ahead of a key safety deadline set by Congress and also sought updates on progress for both the 737 MAX 10 and 777-9, Reuters reported Friday. 
The FAA is still scrutinizing a number of issues involving Boeing and last month said it would not allow Boeing to self-certify 787 Dreamliners.

Nolen will face the headache of the 5G wireless deployment using C-Band spectrum, an issue that saw major international airlines scramble to cancel some U.S flights amid warnings the network could interfere with sensitive aviation electronics. Nolen has been in ongoing discussions with telecom and aviation industry officials.
The FAA also said Saturday that Deputy FAA Administrator Bradley Mims ""will also take on an expanded role during this interim period, focusing on the FAA’s workforce and the nation’s airports.""

""Uber has been granted a London private hire vehicle operator's license for a period of two and a half years,"" a spokesperson for Transport for London (TfL) said in a statement to Reuters. 
In 2019, Uber lost its license to carry paying passengers in London for the second time, and a year later the ride-hailing firm was granted an 18-month London license after a legal battle to restore its operations. The U.S. company first lost its license in 2017. 
Uber had previously claimed that it has assuaged safety concerns by improving insurance document verification systems and rolling out real-time identification.
The firm also struck a deal with Britain's GMB union last year, allowing it to represent up to 70,000 drivers. 

TfL now finds Uber to be a fit and proper person and has granted a license with conditions, the spokesperson added. 
Uber UK said it remain focused on offering drivers the benefits and protections they deserve and also to become a fully electric platform by 2025.

Russia partially resumed some stock trading on Thursday after a near month-long hiatus. On Friday, stocks fell on their second day of trading with losses led by flag carrier Aeroflot.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended higher on Friday as financial shares rose after the benchmark Treasury yield jumped to its highest level in nearly three years.
The Nasdaq ended lower, and tech and other big growth names mostly declined, but they finished off session lows following a late-session rally.
For the week, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registered solid gains of 2% and 1.8%, respectively, and the Dow was nominally higher with a 0.3% rise. 
The S&P 500 financials sector gave the S&P 500 its biggest boost on Friday, rising 1.3%, while technology and consumer discretionary sectors were the only two major sectors to end lower on the day.
Investors are assessing how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be as it tightens policy after Fed Chair Jerome Powell this week said that the central bank needed to move ""expeditiously"" to combat high inflation and raised the possibility of a 50-basis-point hike in rates in May.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped on Friday, with the benchmark 10-year note surging to nearly three-year highs, as the market grappled with high inflation and a Federal Reserve that could easily spark a downturn as it aggressively tightens policy.
Ten-year Treasury yields were last at 2.492% after earlier rising above 2.50% for the first time since May 2019. 
The equity market is pricing in a higher rate environment, said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta.
That is causing bank stocks to outperform, while ""adding more pressure to the riskier elements of the market,"" such as growth shares, he said.
Higher borrowing rates benefit banks, while higher rates are a negative for tech and growth stocks, whose valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 153.3 points, or 0.44%, to 34,861.24, the S&P 500 gained 22.9 points, or 0.51%, to 4,543.06 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.54 points, or 0.16%, to 14,169.30.
Shares of growth companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp eased after leading a Wall Street rebound earlier this week.
The utilities sector also rose sharply, hitting a record high as investors favored defensive stocks with the Russia-Ukraine war still raging after a month. 
The sector ended up 1.5% on the day and up 3.5% for the week, while the energy sector ended up 2.3% on the day and jumped more than 7% for the week following sharp gains in oil prices.
Moscow signaled on Friday it was scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists.
Economists at Citibank are expecting four 50 basis points interest rate hikes from the Fed this year, joining other Wall Street banks in forecasting an aggressive tightening path against the backdrop of soaring inflation.
The U.S. central bank last week raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.

31,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 06:15PM ET</span>","Instacart cuts valuation by 40%; squeezed by tech selloff, heated delivery wars","By Akanksha Khushi and Krystal Hu
(Reuters) -Instacart Inc on late Thursday cut its valuation by nearly 40% to about $24 billion due to recent market turbulence, in an unusual move that shows how public market volatility affects high-flying private companies.The new valuation marks a substantial drop from last March, when the grocery delivery firm was valued at $39 billion in a $265 million funding round from existing investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, as the coronavirus pandemic was raging and doorstep delivery boomed. The latest valuation was not decided by investors but a fair market value study performed by an independent firm, according to a source familiar with the matter, who declined to be identified because the information was not public.

Instacart has not raised any outside capital at the current valuation, the source added.
Several public companies in the delivery space, including DoorDash Inc, have seen their shares plummet in the past three months amid a broader tech selloff, and as investors worry about growth potential. ""We are not immune to the market turbulence that has impacted leading technology companies - both public and private,"" said an Instacart spokesperson. The company said the updated valuation would help it attract and retain talent in a tight U.S. labor market by aligning new equity awards, effectively issuing more shares to employees at a lower price. Instacart will still have to take on amped up competition. Retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc beefed up its grocery deliveries and DoorDash is grabbing a bigger share of the delivery market. It recently decided to buy European rival Wolt for $8 billion.But the competition has also taken a toll on the market value of DoorDash and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. DoorDash is down 23% and Uber has shed nearly 17%. Smaller rival Buyk filed for bankruptcy protection and Fridge No More shut down its operations. Reuters reported last year that Instacart is considering going public through a direct listing, concerned that it could leave money on the table through a traditional initial public offering. Instacart's decision to cut its valuation was first reported by Bloomberg News.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it was again extending its target date to complete an environmental review of the proposed SpaceX Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket program in Boca Chica, Texas, to April 29.
The FAA's previous target date was March 28. The FAA noted that completing the environmental review does not guarantee a vehicle operator license will be issued, which must also meet FAA safety, risk and financial responsibility requirements.
The FAA said it ""is currently reviewing the Final (Programmatic Environmental Assessment) and completing consultation and coordination with agencies at the local, state, and federal level.""
SpaceX founder Elon Musk said last month he was ""highly confident"" his new SpaceX Starship, designed for voyages to the moon and Mars, will reach Earth orbit for the first time this year.
The FAA is deciding whether the planned build-out in Texas poses a significant environmental impact to the area - including an adjacent wildlife reserve - and must therefore undergo a far more extensive study before expanded operations at SpaceX's rocket production facility and spaceport in Boca Chica can be licensed.
Even in a ""worst-case"" scenario, in which a full environmental impact statement were required or legal wrangling over the issue threatened to drag on, Musk said SpaceX has a fall-back plan.

The company would shift its entire Starship program to the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where SpaceX already has received the environmental approval it needs, Musk said.
Such a move would cause a setback of six to eight months, he added. In any case, SpaceX is still shooting for a 2023 launch of what it calls the world's first private lunar mission, flying aboard a Starship to loop around the moon and return to Earth.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 notched a second-weekly win Friday as late-buying in tech propelled the broader market into the green, shrugging off fresh worries about an oil-fueled rise inflation. 
The S&P 500 rose 0.49%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.44%, or 153 points. and the Nasdaq slipped 0.16%.
Investors left in a late chance to buy the dip in tech, helping the sector end well off its session lows despite a surge in Treasury yields on expectations for the Federal Reserve to move more aggressively on rate hikes to stem inflation.  
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) found support to end in the green, while Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was the exception closing below the flatline, though well off session lows. 
U.S. Treasury yields continued to climb, with the 10-year yield briefly topping 2.5% for the first time in nearly three years as Wall Street raises bets on steeper Fed rate hikes at upcoming meetings. 
“We now look for the Fed to raise rates by 50bp at both its May and June meetings, with 25bp rate hikes penciled in for each meeting over the balance of the year,” {{|Morgan Stanley said in a note}}.
A turnaround in oil prices added to inflation jitters following reports that Iran-backed Houthi missile hit an Aramco (SE:2222) oil facility in Saudi Arabia.
The news stoked further worries about supply shortages and offset earlier optimism after the EU failed to reach consensus on joining the U.S. in banning imports of Russian oil. 
In the wake of red-hot inflation, the consumer, the backbone of the U.S. economy, continues to grow wary, with many keeping a closer eye on whether spending is likely to be reined in. 
The University of Michigan’s sentiment index showed U.S. consumer sentiment deteriorated further in late March, falling to a reading of 59.4 from 59.7 earlier in the month.
Banking stocks, which benefit from a rising rate environment boosting returns on the loan products, were up sharply. Comerica (NYSE:CMA), Zions (NASDAQ:ZION), and Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC) led the gains.
Other cyclical corners of the market also played a role in pushing up the broader market, with industrials underpinned by an  Alaska Air  (NYSE:ALK)-led move higher in airline stocks.
Alaska Air Group rose more than 1% after Bank of America backed the airline’s financial outlook, saying it was confident the low-cost airline can top the prior high single digit pre-tax margin expectation and reach its new long term target of 11% to 13%. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) also ended the day up more than 1%.

A version of the bill previously passed the House in December 2020, but failed to advance in the Senate.  "

(Reuters) -Shares on Wall Street took a breather on Friday after a tech-driven rally and U.S. Treasury yields rose to fresh heights as markets evaluated a world of elevated interest rates and the effects of Russia's war in Ukraine.
The Nasdaq fell about 0.16% as technology and healthcare stocks pulled back, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 edged up about 0.5%, with energy and financial shares rising on oil price gains and bets on interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. 
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe was up 0.11%, adding a second consecutive week of gains for the first time in 2022. The pan-European STOXX 600 index also inched up 0.11%, but was down on the week.
Share prices have been supported by global flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for March this week showing the world economy was broadly resilient, but the longer-term economic outlook is making investors cautious.  Barclays  (LON:BARC), for example, cut its 2022 world economic growth forecast this week to 3.3% while traders have ramped up short bets.
Global bond markets continued to see a weeks-long sell-off.
Yields on benchmark 2- and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes jumped to almost three-year highs on Friday as the market anticipates inflation will spiral higher, forcing the Fed to aggressively hike interest rates. 
Ten-year Treasury yields rose 14.3 basis points to 2.484%, a rate last seen in early May 2019. The 2-year yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 16.2 basis points at 2.287% - a rate also last seen in early May 2019.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans was the latest U.S. policymaker to sound more hawkish, saying on Thursday the Fed needs to raise interest rates ""in a timely fashion"" this year and in 2023 to curb high inflation before it is embedded in U.S. psychology and becomes even harder to get rid of.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (BofA) joined a small but growing number of top investment banks calling for more aggressive interest rate increases from the Fed against a backdrop of soaring inflation data. The bank now expects two hikes of 50 basis points (bps) each at its June and July meetings with ""risks"" of those expectations being pulled forward into May and June respectively.
Markets expect U.S. interest rates to rise by as much as 190 bps in total over the rest of this year, after a 25-bps hike last week. Investors are assigning an approximately 77% probability of a 50-bps rate hike in March.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) market analysts wrote in a note late Thursday that fast Fed action was not overly concerning for the economy.
""While a disorderly tightening of financial conditions remains a risk to the outlook, particularly in areas like credit, our baseline growth outlook remains constructive,"" they wrote. ""We think (it) helps contain risks that financial conditions become too dislocated in response to the Fed's actions.""
OIL REVERSAL
Oil prices turned positive on Friday after reports of a missile strike and a fire at Saudi Arabia's state-run oil company Aramco (SE:2222)'s facility.
U.S. crude rose 0.63% to $113.05 per barrel and Brent was at $119.78, also up 0.63% after dropping more than $3 earlier in the session. Both benchmarks were heading for their first weekly gains in three weeks. [O/R]
The U.S. dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies on Friday, a third straight day of gains. The euro was slightly lower.
""The one thing everyone can agree upon is inflation is going to be longer-lasting and a lot of that will be sticky and that will complicate what central banks do,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda in New York. ""You will probably see the dollar lead the charge with rate hikes, Europe will lag and that interest rate differential should provide some support for the dollar.""

Demand for safe-haven assets including gold and the Swiss franc remained resilient as the conflict in Ukraine continued. Moscow on Friday signaled scaling back its ambitions in Ukraine to focus on territory claimed by Russian-backed separatists as Ukrainian forces went on the offensive, recapturing land on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv.
Spot gold remained elevated at $1,955 an ounce, down about 0.10% for the day. [GOLD/]

39,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 03:21PM ET</span>","Investors shelter from twin declines in U.S. stocks, bonds","By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Side-by-side declines in U.S. equity and fixed income markets are pushing investors into cash, commodities and dividend-paying stocks as geopolitical uncertainty and worries over a hawkish Federal Reserve rock asset prices. 
With the first quarter of 2022 winding down, the S&P 500 is down around 5% year-to-date, after falling as much as 12.5% earlier in the year. The ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA Treasury Index, meanwhile, was recently down 5.6% this year, its worst start in history. Investors have traditionally counted on a mix of stocks and bonds to blunt declines in their portfolio, with stocks ideally rising amid economic optimism and bonds strengthening during times of uncertainty. 
That strategy can go awry, however, and market gyrations stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, soaring commodity prices and the Fed’s hawkish tilt have combined to make it harder to follow the playbook this time around. Though a sharp bounce in stocks has more than halved the S&P 500’s losses for the year-to-date, some investors are wary the rebound may not last and are seeking to cut their exposure. ""We are in a perfect storm right now,"" said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Wealth Management. ""We’ve been in periods of heightened geopolitical risk before but this one feels a little different. The negative outcomes could be much more severe and broad.” 
Nixon is increasing stakes in agricultural and energy companies, as well as real estate investment trusts (REITs), which have acted as an inflation hedge in the past. Investors moved $13.2 billion to cash and $2.1 billion to gold over the last week, data from BoFA Global research showed. U.S. stocks saw $3.1 billion in outflows, their largest in nine weeks. The firm’s latest survey showed fund managers’ cash positions earlier this month at their highest since March 2020 . George Young, a portfolio manager at Villere & Co, is raising his portfolio’s cash allocation to nearly 15%, well above the typical 3% of assets he normally holds. ""Cash is paying literally nothing and is arguably negative because of inflation, but we're not seeing many things that we want to buy,"" he said. Recent declines have ""been more painful than many prior bouts of volatility"" due to the twin sell-offs in both stocks and bonds, wrote Michael Fredericks, head of income investing for BlackRock’s Multi-Asset Strategies Team, in a note Friday. He is growing more bullish on dividend-paying stocks, which trade at lower forward price to earnings valuations than the broad S&P 500, and are less sensitive to rising interest rates than growth stocks or bonds. Gains have been particularly hard to come by in the bond market, as investors recalibrate their portfolios to a Fed that appears ready to go all-out in its battle against inflation. Yields on the 10-year benchmark U.S. Treasury, which move inversely to bond prices, reached a three-year high of around 2.5% in the past week, with investors now pricing in more than 200 basis points of interest rate tightening this year. [FEDWATCH] With few attractive opportunities in U.S. debt, Anders Persson, head of global fixed income at Nuveen, has recently increased his positions in dollar-denominated emerging market bonds, in part due to the rally in commodity prices. ""There is not a clean play-book for a post-pandemic Fed pivot at the same time you have a war between Ukraine and Russia,"" he said. 

Investors will be watching U.S. non-farm payroll data next week as they gauge whether the economy is strong enough to handle the Fed's aggressive rate-hike trajectory. To be sure, some investors believe times of overriding pessimism are ideal for buying stocks, an idea supported by ample evidence of defensive position that has accompanied the S&P 500's recent bounce. BoFA Global Research analysts said their contrarian Bull & Bear Indicator recently gave a “buy” signal based on outflows from equity and credit and high levels of cash in investors’ portfolios. 
Adam Hetts, global head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson, said the largest risk for most investors would be ""overreacting to short-term moves"" and jumping headfirst into commodities or gold as a hedge against inflation. Hetts is steering clients into higher-quality equities with strong cash flows such as dividend stocks, and seeing increased investor interest in hedge fund strategies that can take short positions. ""We're having a historically bad start to the year, but we're trying to ensure that the cure isn't worse than the disease,"" he said.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 03:11PM ET</span>","Exclusive: China's Sinopec pauses Russia projects, Beijing wary of sanctions -sources","By Chen Aizhu, Julie Zhu and Muyu Xu
(Reuters) - China's state-run Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Group has suspended talks for a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia, sources told Reuters, heeding a government call for caution as sanctions mount over the invasion of Ukraine.
The move by Asia's biggest oil refiner to hit the brakes on a potentially half-billion-dollar investment in a gas chemical plant and a venture to market Russian gas in China highlights the risks, even to Russia's most important diplomatic partner, of unexpectedly heavy Western-led sanctions. 
Beijing has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions, insisting it will maintain normal economic and trade exchanges with Russia, and has refused to condemn Moscow's actions in Ukraine or call them an invasion.
But behind the scenes, the government is wary of Chinese companies running afoul of sanctions - it is pressing companies to tread carefully with investments in Russia, its second-largest oil supplier and third-largest gas provider.
Since Russia invaded a month ago, China's three state energy giants - Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)) - have been assessing the impact of the sanctions on their multi-billion dollar investments in Russia, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
""Companies will rigidly follow Beijing's foreign policy in this crisis,"" said an executive at a state oil company. ""There's no room whatsoever for companies to take any initiatives in terms of new investment.""
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs this month summoned officials from the three energy companies to review their business ties with Russian partners and local operations, two sources with knowledge of the meeting said. One said the ministry urged them not to make any rash moves buying Russian assets. 
The companies have set up task forces on Russia-related matters and are working on contingency plans for business disruptions and in case of secondary sanctions, sources said.
The sources asked not to be named, given the sensitivity of the matter. Sinopec and the other companies declined to comment. 
The ministry said there is no need for China to report to other parties about ""whether there are internal meetings or not"".
""China is a big, independent country. We have the right to carry out normal economic and trade cooperation in various fields with other countries across the world,"" it said in a faxed statement. 
U.S. President Joe Biden said on Thursday that China knows its economic future is tied to the West, after warning Chinese leader Xi Jinping that Beijing could regret siding with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Global oil majors Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP), and Norway's Equinor pledged to exit their Russian operations shortly after Russia's Feb. 24 invasion. Moscow says its ""special operation"" aims not to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture what it calls dangerous nationalists.
TALKS ON HOLD
Sinopec, formally China Petroleum (NYSE:SNP) and Chemical Corp, has suspended the discussions to invest up to $500 million in the new gas chemical plant in Russia, one of the sources said.
The plan has been to team up with Sibur, Russia's largest petrochemical producer, for a project similar to the $10 billion Amur Gas Chemical Complex in East Siberia, 40% owned by Sinopec and 60% by Sibur, set to come online in 2024.
""The companies wanted to replicate the Amur venture by building another one and were in the middle of site selection,"" said the source.
Sinopec hit pause after realising that Sibur minority shareholder and board member Gennady Timchenko had been sanctioned by the West, the source said. The European Union and Britain last month imposed sanctions on Timchenko, a long-time ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and other billionaires with ties to Putin.
Timchenko's spokesman declined to comment on sanctions.
The Amur project itself faces funding snags, said two of the sources, as sanctions threaten to choke financing from key lenders, including Russia's state-controlled Sberbank and European credit agencies.
""It's an existing investment. Sinopec is trying to overcome the difficulties in financing,"" said a Beijing-based industry executive with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Sibur said it continues to cooperate with Sinopec including working jointly on implementing the Amur plant. It denied that there was a plan to team up with Sinopec for a project similar to the Amur Gas Chemical Complex in east Siberia.
""Sinopec is actively participating in the issues of the project's construction management, including equipment supplies, work with suppliers and contractors. We are also jointly working on the issues of project financing,"" Sibur told Reuters by email.
Sinopec also suspended talks over the gas marketing venture with Russian gas producer Novatek over concerns that Sberbank, one of Novatek's shareholders, is on the latest U.S. sanctions list, said one source with direct knowledge of the matter.
Timchenko resigned from Novatek's board on Monday in the wake of the sanctions. Novatek declined to comment.

Novatek, Russia's largest independent gas producer, entered a preliminary deal in 2019 with Sinopec and Gazprombank to create a joint venture marketing liquefied natural gas to China as well as distributing natural gas in China.
Beyond Sinopec's planned Amur plant, CNPC and CNOOC were among the latest investors into Russia's natural gas sector, taking minority stakes in major export project Arctic LNG 2 in 2019 and Yamal LNG in 2014.

Investing.com --  Fortinet  Inc (NASDAQ:FTNT) stock fell 1.6% Friday after BofA analyst Tal Liani cut it to neutral from buy. High expectations are impacting the stock's performance.
""The company is performing well, with 4Q21 billings up 35.9% YoY and billings growth guidance for 1Q/FY22 of 25.8% and 30.1% YoY, respectively,"" said Liani.
The analyst noted that the strong past performance has seen the shares rise 76% in the last 12 months, yet they ""already see the high expectations impacting the stock performance, with the stock only up 3% with increased volatility since reporting its robust 4Q21 results, attesting to the difficulties to beat the high Street expectations after a few years of strong performance.""
The BofA analyst also cut the price target on Fortinet shares to $355 from $385 to reflect their current valuation outlook.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Months after receiving a major infusion of capital, Sierra Nevada Corp's space unit, Sierra Space, has tapped a veteran Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co executive to helm its finances as it races to develop its flagship space plane and studies a public offering, two people familiar with the matter said. 
Outgoing Sierra Space CFO Robert Rodgers pitched investors and led due diligence efforts for around a year leading up to the landmark $1.4 billion capital round it announced in November, according to his LinkedIn profile. Sierra said it was the second-largest private capital infusion ever in the aerospace and defense sector and boosted Sierra's value to $4.5 billion.
Replacing Rodgers will be 10-year  Boeing Co  veteran Troy Lahr, who departed as CFO of the aerospace company's defense, space and security unit in recent weeks.
A Boeing spokesperson confirmed Lahr had left the company in recent weeks but declined further comment. 
A Sierra Space spokesperson confirmed in a statement that Lahr would join the company soon.
""Sierra Space is assembling a world class management team, including Troy, that sees many lucrative opportunities in the marketplace for investors, while at the same time driving innovation and fueling our mission to explore space and benefit life on Earth,"" the Sierra Space spokesperson said.
The spokesperson declined further comment. 
The reason for Rodgers' departure was not immediately clear. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Industry sources say Sierra is exploring a potential public offering among other options in the next two to three years but say that no decision has been made.
The financial leadership change comes as the Louisville, Colorado-based company races to develop a reusable space plane dubbed Dream Chaser to handle cargo resupply missions to the International Space Station (ISS) starting in early 2023. 
Sierra Space says Dream Chaser's ability to land on a traditional runway gives it an edge over rival solutions for delicate scientific research cargo. Rivals including Elon Musk's SpaceX are already carrying people and cargo to the ISS.
Sierra envisions a future where a fleet of its space planes - similar to the Space Shuttle, but much smaller - ferry humans and cargo from space ports across the world to a bustling new space economy. 

""We are building the next generation of space transportation systems and in-space infrastructures and destinations that will enable humanity to build and sustain thriving civilizations beyond Earth,"" Sierra Space Chief Executive Officer Tom Vice said last year. 
Sierra Space has also forged a partnership with billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to develop and operate a commercial space station in low earth orbit. Backers for the so-called orbital reef project include Boeing and Redwire Space.

Air Lease will provide Aeromexico with two new 737-8s and seven new 737-9s, which will arrive between July 2022 and August 2023, the aircraft leasing company said.
The deal comes after Aeromexico said last week it would spend $5 billion over the next five years on upgrades, including revamping its fleet to reach 147 aircraft by the end of the year.
""The 737 offers the most modern, fuel-efficient technology to enhance the global capabilities of Mexico's premier airline,"" Air Lease Corporation Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said in a statement.
Aeromexico declared bankruptcy in mid-2020 after travel demand plummeted following the coronavirus pandemic.
The airline came to an agreement with debtors in a U.S. court in January, and then it recently carried out a forward stock split and subsequent reverse split to shuffle company control, formalizing its exit from bankruptcy. 

Aeromexico shares were up 8.45% Friday morning after a volatile week on Mexico's principal market. One analyst said shares would continue to behave erratically until traders had more information about the airline's financial situation.
Shares in Air Lease were up some 1.35% on the New York Stock Exchange following the announcement.

The audio streaming platform closed its office in Russia indefinitely earlier this month, citing what it described as Moscow's ""unprovoked attack on Ukraine."" 
Russia's new legislation makes it illegal to report any event that could discredit the Russian military. 
""Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) has continued to believe that it's critically important to try to keep our service operational in Russia to provide trusted, independent news and information from the region,"" Spotify said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, recently enacted legislation further restricting access to information, eliminating free expression, and criminalizing certain types of news puts the safety of Spotify's employees and the possibility of even our listeners at risk.""

The service is expected to end in early April, according to one person with knowledge of the situation.
Another streaming service, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), suspended service in Russia earlier this month after saying it had no plans to add state-run channels to its Russian service, despite a regulation that would require it to do so.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Apple is set to be hit with another fine next week for not fully complying with an order to open its App Store to rival forms of payment for dating apps in the Netherlands, Dutch antitrust watchdog ACM told Reuters.
The iPhone maker has already racked up 45 million euros ($49 million) in penalties to date as ACM (Authority for Consumers and Markets) has slapped weekly 5 million euro fines on the company since January, with the ninth penalty handed out this week.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) submitted a fresh proposal to the ACM this week in a bid to halt the sanction. The offer does not fully comply with its order, an official at the Dutch watchdog, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters on Friday.
Subsequent fines once the total penalty hits 50 million euros could be higher according to ACM rules.
Apple, which requires developers to use its system and pay commissions of 15-30% on digital goods purchases and is feeling regulatory scrutiny worldwide over this, was not immediately available for comment.
An investigation by ACM on whether Apple's practices amounted to an abuse of a dominant market position was launched in 2019. It was later reduced in scope to focus primarily on dating market apps, including Tinder owner  Match Group Inc  (NASDAQ:MTCH).
ACM says Apple abuses its market dominance and has ordered it to change this practice. Apple has denied market abuse. 

Under tough new rules agreed on Thursday between the European Commission, EU governments and EU lawmakers, Apple will be required to open up its App Store once the legislation comes into force in October.

BOSTON (Reuters) - One of investor Carl Icahn's director nominees at McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) said she would push the burger giant to tackle sustainability issues like lowering the environmental impact of farming and lessening antibiotic use.
So far Icahn, the well-known activist investor, has framed his challenge seeking two board seats at McDonald's mainly over the treatment of pigs by the chain's suppliers.
But Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management, said ending the use of gestation crates, as Icahn has urged, would have other benefits like reducing crowded factory farms that cause pollution.
""While we think they're a strong company, they have some vulnerabilities they're not recognizing on reputational and governance risks,"" Samuelrich said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday.
She said she conveyed her concerns to three McDonald's directors in a meeting this week, and hopes the company will make her a candidate to be elected to its board later this spring. 
A McDonald's representative declined to comment. 
Samuelrich is a well-known voice on corporate environmental issues, including an effort in 2018 that led McDonald's to agree to restrict the use of antibiotics in its beef supply. Samuelrich said she is concerned McDonald's has not followed through.
On its website McDonald's says it is working with partners on responsible antibiotic use and that amid COVID-related delays it is ""evolving our plan."" The company also has said https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/press-releases.response-carl-icahn.html it would evaluate Icahn's nominees, and defended its treatment of animals.
Separately, Samuelrich said she supports steps McDonald's has taken in Russia in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. The company's temporary store closures in Russia are costing it about $50 million a month as it continues to pay staff.

Samuelrich said unless Russian President Vladimir Putin changes course, McDonald's should consider pulling out of the country entirely. 
Doing so would ""send a message to the Russian leadership and residents about how Putin's invasion has been viewed"" abroad, she said.

Investing.com -- Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) stock inched up 0.4% after UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley reiterated a buy rating and $280 price target.

The analyst said in a note that it was time to talk about making money from the video format Reels.
Walmsley said Instagram newsfeed changes, along with Reels monetization should help to drive a ""meaningful bump"" to time spent on the social media platform overall and lead to higher monetization at scale.
The push of Reels before monetization could see a 6% revenue challenge in the first half of the year, added Walmsley. However, as the company scales up monetization, it could turn into a 8% to 15% tailwind, he noted, driving a ""meaningful inflection"" in advertising revenue.

(Reuters) -European shares ended a choppy session slightly higher on Friday but were down on the week as investors worried about the fallout from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while a rally in the commodities sector kept a lid on declines.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 0.1%, with losses for banks and some defensive stocks offsetting gains in energy, basic materials and technology names. 
""Some late weakness has seen equities fall back, but overall the rally in equities is still going,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
""Nervousness remains, but equities have moved through the week without giving back too much ground.""
After two weeks of the gains that saw it rise more than 7%, the STOXX 600 lost 0.2% this week, as lofty energy and commodity prices from sanctions on Russia fanned inflation fears and stoked worries about an economic growth slowdown. 
The United States will work to supply liquefied natural gas to the European Union this year to help it wean off Russian energy supplies, Western leaders said, as Russia warned payment in roubles for natural gas exports was just days away, exacerbating supply shortage worries. 
Germany said it has made significant progress towards reducing its exposure to imports of Russian gas, oil and coal.
Europe's basic materials sector is up a whopping 20% so far this year and the energy index is 15% higher. 
The Ukraine crisis is likely to reduce prospects for global growth in the coming year, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned on Friday.
German business morale deteriorated in March due to worsening supply chain issues resulting from high petrol prices, but the country is not facing a recession in the first quarter due to the Ukraine war, the Ifo institute said on Friday.
""Equities are seen as a relatively good hedge in case of inflation, but the type of inflation that we're currently seeing is a supply shock, which is unlike the demand destruction caused by COVID-19,"" said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at Rabobank.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) restricted the use of Apple Pay, which began operating in Russia in 2016, on March 1 in the wake of Russia's decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, preventing Russian Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) cardholders using the service.

53,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 01:02PM ET</span>",Analysis-Hard landing: Lessors lose hope of getting Russian planes back,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) -As the clock runs down to Monday's sanctions deadline for Russian airlines to hand back more than 400 leased planes worth almost $10 billion, foreign lessors are fast losing hope that they will get their aircraft back.
Most of the planes are still flying Russian domestic routes, IBA consultancy says, although Bermuda and Ireland - where most are registered - have suspended airworthiness certificates which usually means they should be grounded.
Aviation was an early business casualty of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, as the West and Russia imposed tit-for-tat airspace bans. Now, lessors face big writedowns or a long insurance battle as the March 28 deadline looms for terminating plane leases under European Union sanctions.
""I'm afraid that we are going to witness the largest sort of theft of aircraft in the history of commercial civil aviation,"" said Volodymyr Bilotkach, an associate professor of air transport management at Singapore Institute of Technology.
Dual registration is not allowed under international rules, but Russia has already moved more than half of the foreign-owned aircraft to its own registry after passing a law permitting this, Russia's government said on Wednesday.
The government also said 78 planes leased to Russian carriers had been seized while abroad and would not fly back to Russia, Interfax news agency said on Tuesday.
Major aircraft lessor Avolon has terminated all its Russian airline leases and repossessed four of the 14 owned aircraft on lease with Russian airlines outside the country, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.
It wasn't clear if the four planes were part of the 78 reported by Moscow.
Although the planes are insured, the unprecedented nature and scale of the potential losses will likely mean years of litigation between lessors and insurers before any decisions on payouts are taken, analysts say.
And even if the planes are repossessed, the recoverable value would be in question because the aircraft must have accurate maintenance records to ensure they have been fitted with genuine, traceable components - another area targeted by Western sanctions on Russia.
Although the total value of the planes is huge, the impact on individual leasing firms may still be manageable even if writedowns are required as aircraft leased to Russian airlines account for less than 10% of most leasing firm portfolios.
""It's not going to cripple these businesses,"" said Brad Dailey, a director at Alton Aviation Consultancy who previously worked at Ireland-based leasing giant AerCap Holdings.
""What it does do in my view is it changes the future market potential of Russia,"" he said.
COVERING LOSSES
Some private airlines have indicated their willingness to hand back planes to the lessors, although it is unclear whether the Russian government will approve the transactions.
Russia's UTair Airlines said on March 14 it would withdraw from service all nine of its leased Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 NGs, citing owner requirements, a move that could preserve longer-term relations after sanctions end.
Those planes have not flown since that announcement but remain in Russia, data from flight tracking website FlightRadar24 show.
In some cases, lessors have security deposits that could be forfeit and could help cover a portion of any losses - but still only a fraction of a plane's value.
For example, a security deposit on narrowbody plane worth $20 million could be about $450,000, the equivalent of three months rent, Alton's Dailey said.
Ratings agency KBRA said security deposits generally range from one to four months of rent, depending on the credit assessment of the airline leasing the plane.
Russian national carrier Aeroflot had been viewed as the best credit risk before the invasion, industry sources said, although that assessment no longer applies after Moscow's move to register its planes in Russia.
A person at a Chinese lessor with exposure to Aeroflot said no security deposits had been taken from the airline and said insurance payouts appeared to be the only route to cover losses.
The lessor plans to begin insurance claims after the March 28 deadline has passed, said the person, who was not authorised to speak publicly about the matter.

A source at another Chinese lessor with exposure to Aeroflot said that, instead of taking a security deposit, it held U.S. dollar letters of credit from Russian banks - but the source said they had no effective value now because of Russian currency controls imposed in response to financial sanctions.
At lower-tier airlines, lessors are more likely to have stronger security deposits in place, Dailey said.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC is shunning prospective Russian clients and declining credit to some existing ones, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, as the bank seeks to shield itself from Western sanctions against Moscow. 
The measures affect HSBC's individual and business customers globally and go further than the bank's previously stated intentions to wind down its relations with lenders such as VTB, which were placed under Western restrictions after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
The moves by Europe's second biggest bank show how sanctions aimed at Russia's financial system and its political and business elite are also ensnaring Russian nationals outside the country as lenders seek to avoid falling foul of the restrictions and potentially hefty fines.
HSBC had said on March 14 it is ""not accepting any new business in Russia,"" without spelling out what that means for existing or prospective Russian customers in other markets.
The sources said the bank's risk and compliance staff have told business managers to apply extra scrutiny to all prospective clients bearing Russian passports or furnishing Russian addresses, with the result that many more are turned away than would have been in the past.
The checks also extend to dual passport-holders as well as those with links to Belarus, seen as an ally of Moscow, as the bank's staff scramble to ensure they do not inadvertently offer services to sanctioned individuals or businesses.
HSBC declined to comment.
Customers with business ties to Russia and receiving income in roubles, such as those deriving income from Russian employment, pensions, or investments, are also being impacted as those rouble cashflows are discounted to zero for credit purposes, one of the sources, who works at HSBC, told Reuters.
Business customers with Russian links, even those with no ties to sanctioned entities or individuals, face increased scrutiny on large deposits or withdrawals and are seeing new loan applications declined, the two sources said.
The invasion has triggered an exodus of foreign companies from Russia as Western authorities deploy sanctions at an unprecedented scale and pace to squeeze Moscow and prevent the global financial system from being a conduit for Russian money.
Reuters reported earlier this month that European Union regulators had told some banks to tighten control of all Russian and Belarusian clients, including EU residents, to ensure they are not used to circumvent sanctions.
Russia characterises its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country.
BUSINESS FREEZE
Leading European banks such as Italy's UniCredit and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said they could face a multi-billion dollar write-off of their businesses in Russia, but banks also face a wider chill on business as they grapple with sanctions. 
HSBC does not operate a retail bank inside Russia but as of Feb. 22 it had around 200 staff there serving multinational corporations, its Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson told Reuters at the time. The bank said on March 14 its business there ""will continue to reduce.""
The latest HSBC measures go beyond the usual background checks, and show how banks' policies are still evolving since the invasion as they try to implement multiple waves of sanctions without discriminating against legitimate customers.
They also show the tension between banks' sanctions and compliance teams, who urge the strictest possible interpretation of new rules to satisfy regulators, and frontline staff tasked with growing the business and serving clients.

HSBC is under particular pressure to show regulators that it can identify illegal transactions. It had to tighten up its money laundering controls globally after a string of past scandals and, in 2012, agreed to pay $1.9 billion to U.S. authorities for allowing itself to be used to launder drug money flowing out of Mexico.
HSBC is reviewing all existing private and retail banking customers with Russian connections globally to see if they have ties to sanctioned entities or individuals, the sources said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) workers at the company's JFK8 Staten Island warehouse started casting ballots on Friday on whether to form a union as labor organizers look to New York for the first-ever union victory in the retail giant's 28-year history. 
As the second-largest U.S. private employer, Amazon has long been a focus for labor advocates who hope that a single union victory will spark organizing efforts across the country.
Geebah Sando, a package sorter who has worked at JFK8 for more than two years, said he is voting in favor of the union. 
He hopes a unionized workplace would mean higher wages and more benefits, including longer breaks and more paid time off.
The push to organize is spearheaded by a group of workers known as the Amazon Labor Union (ALU). In-person voting at JFK8 will last until March 30, with votes set to be counted on March 31.
“We look forward to having our employees’ voices heard. Our focus remains on working directly with our team to continue making Amazon a great place to work,” said Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel.
Keisha Renaud, 50, an associate from East Orange, New Jersey, said she would leave the facility if it unionizes.
“The energy they are taking to start a union, why didn’t they take that energy to start a team to talk to the managers. I think Amazon would listen,” she said, wearing a pink shirt that says ""Vote No.""
Distrust of unions is common among workers, fanned by Amazon itself, which has warned in meetings staff were obliged to attend that labor groups could mandate strikes or shrink pay, something organizers have disputed.
'NO EXPERIENCE'
Some workers said they are open to a unionized workplace but have concerns about ALU’s ability to advocate on their behalf.
“The union has no experience at all,” said Claudia Rodriguez, 58, who has worked at JFK8 for four years. Rodriguez, while walking up to the voting tent, said she was still on the fence about whether to back the union.
There was a long line to cast a vote, but Chris Smalls, president of ALU and a former employee at the Staten Island warehouse, said he was encouraged by the turnout. 
""Whichever way they vote, I’m happy to see it happen,"" Smalls said.
Workers at the company's other warehouse in Staten Island, LDJ5, will also vote in person on whether to unionize starting on April 25, according to a National Labor Relations Board election notice. 
A rerun of last year's failed union organizing campaign at Amazon's warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, is also scheduled to conclude on Friday. Votes will be counted starting on Monday for this second closely watched election. 

The NLRB found that Amazon improperly interfered in the original contest, when the company won by a two-to-one margin. 
The American labor movement has gained momentum over the past year, motivated by the high-profile Alabama campaign, ongoing pandemic concerns and strikes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of U.S. Senate Democrats is pressing large U.S. banks to scrap or significantly reduce overdraft and other fees they charge customers with insufficient funds.
In a letter sent to seven large firms Thursday, the group of five lawmakers -- including Senate Banking Chairman Sherrod Brown -- called for a ""fairer and more transparent"" fee structure.
Democratic lawmakers and regulators are placing heightened scrutiny on bank fees. The group cited recent research from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which found nearly 80% of such fees are charged to only 9% of accounts. The CFPB is currently soliciting public feedback on ways to potentially curtail overdraft and other ""junk fees,"" and a House Financial Services subcommittee will hold a hearing Thursday on the fees.
Under political and regulatory pressure, several large banks, including some that received letters, have taken steps to curtail such fees.
In February,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) announced it would eliminate overdraft fees by this summer. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co and US Bancorp (NYSE:USB) have moved to give customers extra time to bring their account balances above zero. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said it would reduce overdraft fees to $10 from $35 beginning in May and eliminate its ""nonsufficient fund"" fees.
JPMorgan had already taken other steps requested in the letter, such as eliminating nonsufficient fund fees, according to a spokeswoman.
But banking groups are resisting government efforts to eliminate overdraft fees, arguing they serve a useful purpose.
""A majority of consumers who use the product do so knowingly and count on it when unexpected expenses arise. As a result, contrary to what is stated in the letter, the Consumer Bankers Association believes taking action that would dramatically restrict overdraft could force many families out of the well-regulated, well-supervised banking and toward predatory payday lenders,"" said CBA spokesperson Lauren Bair Bianchi.

Copies of the letter were sent to chief executives at JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) Corp, PNC Financial Services Group (NYSE:PNC), US Bancorp and  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp.
Spokespeople for the other banks either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.

60,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 12:21PM ET</span>",Analysis-New EU rules regulating U.S. tech giants likely to set global standard,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Landmark EU rules targeting Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are likely to set a global benchmark and may even force changes in the tech giants' business models, lawyers and experts said.
Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager won backing on Thursday from European Union members and EU lawmakers for her proposal, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), to rein in the powers of the tech giants via legislation for the first time, rather than lengthy antitrust investigations.
The DMA sets out a list of dos and don'ts targeting each tech giant's core business practices.
The legislation, which is expected to go into force in October, could bring sweeping changes to the global tech industry, upsetting profits and the dominance of the companies who built up huge businesses operating like walled gardens.
Google, a unit of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), would be barred from unfairly ranking its own services above rivals under the DMA. 
Apple, which warned about malware risks and cybercriminals hijacking its iPhone, may have to open up its App Store to allow customers install software from other apps or the internet. 
It may face a similar requirement in its home market after a U.S. Senate panel last month voted to advance a bill that would force companies to allow people to load apps on their phones without using official app stores.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would have to let WhatsApp users interact with others on rival messaging services, according to the DMA.
""DMA is here to stay and will be quickly mirrored in a number of countries. The flexibility that big tech had will be constrained, as the regulatory 'straitjacket' will get tighter globally,"" said Ioannis Kokkoris, competition law professor at Queen Mary University in London.
Vestager's switch to legislation came amid frustration over slow-moving antitrust investigations that deliver remedies criticised by rivals as inadequate. Google has often been cited as an example, with critics saying it has yet to show a significant change of approach despite being fined more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) after a decade-long investigation.
The new rules include hefty fines between 10% to 20% of a company's annual global turnover, which could push tech giants to rethink their strategy on long-term goals and swap their business models for others.
PRESSURE
""If it succeeds, the DMA will put pressure on monopoly rents of gatekeepers in tipped markets, thereby encouraging them to move towards more long term innovation targets,"" said Nicolas Petit, professor of competition law at the European University Institute in Florence.
""I think the DMA indirectly places a premium on business models based on subscriptions or device level monetisation. We might see more (increased) prices, and vertical integration into hardware in the future,"" he said.
The DMA applies to gatekeepers with app stores, search engines, social networks, online ad services, cloud computing firms, web browsers and virtual assistants.
The big tech companies, with its army of lawyers, might also be able to find some wiggle room to dodge the full impact of the DMA, raising questions whether the Commission will have a big enough team to enforce the new rules.
""The Commission suggested upon proposing the DMA that it would be enforced by a team of 80 people,"" said Thomas Vinje, a partner at law firm Clifford Chance in Brussels who has advised rivals in cases against Microsoft, Google and Apple. 
""This will not be enough to enable effective enforcement,"" he said.
Apple and Google have lobbied intensively against the DMA, saying it could create unnecessary privacy and security risks for their users and hold back innovation and lead to fewer consumer choices.
The DMA is just the first step towards making sure that tech giants play fair, said Alec Burnside, a partner at law firm Dechert in Brussels.

""The DMA is not a perfectly formed panacea from the start, and without doubt gatekeepers will try to navigate around it. Rome was not built in a day, nor was the highway code perfect when first conceived,"" he said.

61,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 12:21PM ET</span>","Rouble extends recovery, stocks slide on 2nd day of trade, led by Aeroflot","(Reuters) -The rouble extended recovery gains on Friday, hitting its strongest since early March against the dollar, while stocks fell in their second day of trading after a near month-long suspension, with losses led by flag carrier Aeroflot.
The Russian market is gradually reopening and returning to normal after a suspension caused by sweeping Western sanctions that followed the beginning of what Russia calls ""a special operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The rouble, which hit a record low in Moscow of 120 earlier in March, firmed to 92.04 to the greenback, a level last seen on March 1. It also climbed past the psychologically important threshold of 100 to the euro.
As of 1356 GMT, the rouble pared some gains and was 0.3% stronger at 96.52 to the dollar and added 1% to trade at 105.75 against the euro.
The response to events in Ukraine has ripped Russian financial markets from global networks and sent the rouble tumbling, although it was on course for five consecutive sessions of growth, heading for a weekly gain of up to 10%.
Foreign investors cut their exposure to Russia, with non-residents' share among holders of OFZ treasury bonds falling to its lowest since late 2012 as of March 1.
The rouble received a boost on Wednesday after Putin said Russia would start selling its gas to ""unfriendly"" countries in roubles.
Fewer imports to Russia, the exodus of Western companies and Putin's switch to roubles for gas exports are all positive for the Russian currency, Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) analysts said in a note.
""A return to the old pre-war (rouble) strength is nonetheless unlikely,"" they said, pointing to the effect that lower demand and shrinking exports will have. 
In offshore markets, the rouble was trading at about 99 to the dollar, weaker than in Moscow, where cash purchases of foreign currency are restricted. 
STOCKS TURN SOUTH
Airline Aeroflot lost more than a quarter of its value over two days to plunge to its lowest since 2009 as securities slid lower across the board on Friday after many blue chips posted double-digit gains on Thursday.
Shares in Aeroflot dropped 18.2% to its weakest point since early 2009, adding to Thursday's 16% loss. 
The benchmark MOEX stock index closed 3.7% lower at 2,484.13 points. It had closed 4.4% higher on Thursday. 
The dollar-denominated RTS index fell 2.7% to 829.6 points.
Prior to Thursday, stocks had not traded on Moscow's bourse since Feb. 25, the day after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent thousands of troops into neighbouring Ukraine. 
The move prompted Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically, and Russian countermeasures.
On Friday more securities, including corporate bonds and Eurobonds, were being traded in another short session, and restrictions on trading by foreigners alongside a ban on short selling remained. 
State lenders Sberbank and VTB fell 3.5% and 7.9% respectively.
Oil major Rosneft and mining giant Nornickel were exceptions, gaining 1.4% and 0.4%. 
RUSSIAN RESPONSE
The central bank on Friday said restrictions imposed on capital flows were a tit-for-tat move after its reserves were frozen by Western countries.
""In response to the freezing of part of Russia's reserves, Russia also introduced restrictions on the movement of funds that could be transferred to unfriendly countries by a comparable amount,"" the central bank said.
Moscow is now looking to friendlier markets. Andrei Kostin, chief executive of VTB, whose activities have been hit by sanctions, said opportunities would arise elsewhere and that his lender was offering accounts to Russians in Chinese yuan. 

""We have already deposited the equivalent of 16 billion roubles in yuan, citizens are already depositing, and there are other currencies of neighbouring states,"" he told RBC TV. 
Dominant lender Sberbank said late on Thursday it expects trade turnover and settlements of the rouble-yuan pair on Moscow Exchange to increase.

The Russian Council of Shopping Centres (RCSC), an organisation representing developers, shopping centre owners and retail chain operators, said it was negotiating with its corresponding representatives in the four countries about finding alternatives to western brands. 
""A list of foreign companies that have temporarily ceased operations in Russia was sent to them so that appropriate equivalents can be found,"" a statement on the RCSC website read. 
""Over time this will help supplement or completely replace goods of the defunct brands with ones of a similar quality and design."" 
Dozens of big brands have temporarily shuttered operations or exited the country since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it calls a special operation.
Sanctions have hampered supply chains and fuelled panic buying among some Russians, with medicine and sugar shortages reported, and accelerating inflation is set to send prices higher.
During an RCSC meeting of more than 100 market participants, the challenges facing Russian retailers were discussed. 
RCSC cited Igor Maltinsky, director of development at Melon Fashion Group, as saying that the main challenge facing domestic retail firms was the uncontrollable growth of production costs, due to huge increases in procurement and logistics costs, as well as many other related factors. 

Melon owns four, mainly women's, fashion brands - Zarina, Befree, Love Republic and Sela and had 846 stores across Russia and CIS at the end of 2021. It had been planning to hold an initial public offering (IPO) this year.
On Thursday, Swedish real estate firm Eastnine, a minority shareholder in Melon, said the planned IPO had been postponed. It said western sanctions had negatively affected the company, making valuing it very difficult.

LONDON (Reuters) - Finland's Wartsila, a leading ship engine maker, has suspended business with Russia including equipment training while German counterpart MAN Energy Solutions is reviewing contracts, adding further trade pressure on Moscow.
Russia's maritime sector is already grappling with the winding down of other services including ship certification by leading foreign providers - vital for accessing ports and securing insurance - shipping companies pulling out and Western sanctions being imposed on its leading ocean transporter Sovcomflot after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Wartsila, a top global marine and energy equipment maker, has suspended all deliveries and sales to Russia and Belarus due to the war in Ukraine and would take action to ""follow the European Union sanctions framework as it evolves"", a company spokesperson said. 
""As part of this, training on using our engines/ship technology for Russian legal entities has been halted, regardless of the nationality of the individuals,"" the spokesperson said.
""Such training can be offered to Russian nationals working for non-Russian legal entities. Training cannot however be offered to individuals, regardless of their nationality, having their residence in Russia.""
Two shipping sources said MAN Energy Solutions had also suspended training for using its equipment in Russia. 
A company spokesperson said it was ""complying 100% with the imposed sanctions"".

MAN Energy Solutions said separately in a statement that all existing contracts and orders connected to Russia ""have to be reviewed on a case by case base"".
Shipping industry sources say given the complexities of the world's seaborne trade it was unclear how Russian companies would be able to operate with multiple services being withdrawn.

MILAN (Reuters) - CVC Capital Partners and rival private equity investors are looking at a potential investment into the services arm of  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) under a planned reorganisation of Italy's former phone monopoly, sources said on Friday.
In the meantime, Italy's government is readying new rules to force companies owning strategic assets to notify it of any preliminary discussions with potential suitors.
The new provisions, part of a broader plan to beef up Italy's existing anti-takeover rules or so-called golden powers, are primarily aimed at policing any changes to TIM's ownership structure, two separate government officials told Reuters. 
After CVC said it has been looking for some time at the reorganisation under way at TIM, a source familiar with the matter said the fund was set to formalise an expression of interest in TIM's service arm as early as on Friday. 
CVC was not immediately available to comment. TIM declined to comment.
TIM is already assessing a 10.8 billion euro ($11.9 billion)takeover approach from U.S. fund giant KKR.
Newly-appointed Chief Executive Pietro Labriola has unveiled plans to split TIM's service businesses from its domestic fixed network operations to unlock value and pursue M&A deals.
A newly-created services entity would include TIM's enterprise business, such as cloud, IoT and cybersecurity operations, for which broker Bestinver pegged a valuation of 10.5 billion euros. 
SHARES GAIN 
Other sources said other private equity firms, including Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), are looking at a potential investment into TIM's service operations.
""At least three big funds are assessing TIM's situation with the view of a potential investment into its service arm,"" one of the people said.
Apollo declined to comment.
After tumbling to a record low earlier this month, TIM's shares jumped as much as 7.2% to hit a three-weeks highs around 0.35 euros on Friday, with traders and analysts citing speculative appeal linked to private equity interest.
The KKR approach was pitched at 0.505 euros. 
TIM, whose top investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) criticised KKR's offer as too low, is seeking to revive a long-held project to merge its fixed line assets with those of Open Fiber.
Such a move is supported by TIM's second-largest investor, state lender CDP, which own a 60% stake in Open Fiber.
A source familiar with the matter said TIM, which left KKR waiting for nearly four months without an answer before engaging in formal talks earlier this month, is preparing another letter to request further clarifications from KKR. 

The same source said TIM board of directors will be updated on the KKR developments at a meeting next Tuesday.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The Bundestag lower house on Friday approved legislation requiring Germany's privately-operated gas storage facilities to be full at the start of the next winter, to try to avert shortages in the event of a halt in Russian gas imports.
The law requires facilities to be 65% full by Aug. 1, 80% full by October, when the heating season and the gas season for utilities and traders starts, and 90% by November. 
Storage levels, currently at 25%, must be at least 40% in February 2023.
Germany's gas market trading hub, Trading Hub Europe (THE), which is overseen by the country's energy regulator, will be responsible for ensuring the thresholds are met by issuing tenders for traders.
The law allows THE to purchase gas via tenders using state funds in case of an emergency.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government has been acting to cut Germany's exposure to Russian energy imports after President Vladimir Putin began what he has called a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine on Feb. 24. Kyiv and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war.
The law aligns with coordination at European Union level for member states to build up stocks and buy more gas from third countries.
In the four weeks since the invasion, Germany reduced its gas imports from Russia to 40% from 55%, Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Friday.
Energy prices in Europe hit records even before the invasion. European countries accused the Kremlin of deliberately reducing the volumes of gas delivered through pipelines to historically low levels. Russia denied this and said it had met contractual demands.
In Germany, a third of gas storage belongs to Russia's Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), whose facilities in Germany had lower levels of stored gas this winter than those operated by other companies.

If there is a risk of shortage, the law allows the national energy hub to use facilities that are empty or below the stipulated filling levels to store its own gas purchases.
Operators have criticised the plans, saying they interfere with the market and price signals.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Hedge fund Starboard Value LP on Friday lost a fight to replace four directors at  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN) Corp but shares of the U.S. specialty chemicals company tumbled in early trading as investors learned about the result.
Starboard, which owns 8.8% of Huntsman, argued that the chemicals manufacturer needs a shake-up to improve its financial performance. The hedge fund also said the company's board was captive to CEO Peter Huntsman, whose father founded the company in 1982.
Huntsman countered by saying it had the right people and plans in place to produce strong returns and pointed to its shares being near all-time highs and outperforming peers, as well as to the additions of eight new directors to its board since 2018.
Huntsman, which is valued at $8.6 billion and makes chemical products for use in construction materials to plastics, said that based on preliminary results all 10 of its director nominees were reelected. 
""The outcome of today's shareholder vote is validation of our portfolio strategy and recognition that the Huntsman of today is vastly different than the Huntsman of five years ago,"" CEO Peter Huntsman said in a statement.
The company's share price fell nearly 12% in early trading.
Starboard CEO Jeffrey Smith said in a statement that preliminary results appear to show that less than 50% of the shares outstanding backed the company's contested nominees. 
""We hope that the board recognizes that this clearly shows that shareholders not only expect management to fulfill its promises, but also expect the board to hold management accountable for these promises.""
The defeat marks Starboard's second loss of a shareholder vote in less than a year. In September, it failed in its board challenge against cloud services provider Box Inc.
Starboard's director candidates at Huntsman included former  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB) CEO James Gallogly, Starboard's Smith, former industry executive Sandra Beach Lin and former banker Susan Schnabel. 
Starboard is one of the busiest activist investors and has long won more board seats than other activists, data show.
Last year, Huntsman promised to improve margins and return $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and pledged to run a sales process for its non-core Textile Effects unit and not to spend more than $500 million on a single acquisition. 

Starboard expressed concern that Huntsman had failed to make disclosures recommended by the Task Force on Climate-retlaed Financial Disclosures even though investors requested them two years ago.
Proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis backed all of management's candidates while Institutional Shareholder Services, another proxy advisory firm, said change was warranted and recommended that investors elect two of Starboard's nominees.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Wednesday said it would allow  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) to use its own payment system in its Android app as part of a new pilot aimed at countering appmakers' concerns about high fees and allegedly anticompetitive behavior.
Users who have downloaded Spotify from the Google Play Store will be presented with a choice to pay with either Spotify's payment system or with Google Play Billing in some countries in the coming months.
The pilot will allow a small number of participating developers, starting with Spotify, to offer an additional billing option next to Google Play's billing system in their apps.
""This pilot will help us to increase our understanding of whether and how user choice billing works for users in different countries and for developers of different sizes and categories,"" Google said in a blog post.
Under a new competition law in South Korea last year, Google also said it would allow developers to introduce a second payment system alongside its own there.
Spotify said its trial with Google was part of a ""multi-year agreement,"" without elaborating.
App developers such as Spotify that sell digital goods have complained for years about having to use the official payment systems of the Play store and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store. 
Google and Apple collect up to 30% of each payment as a fee, which developers say is too high. Both have lowered fees in many circumstances and have said that they are needed to fund a safe and secure mobile ecosystem.

Google did not specify the fee that it would collect in the new pilot.
The company is ramping up enforcement of its Google Play Billing requirement, and it has said non-compliant apps could be blocked from publishing updates starting on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Distressed debt hedge fund Gramercy, which made a killing on Russian bonds after the 1998 crisis and has taken on Argentina and Venezuela over defaulted debt, says a bet on Russia now is too big a risk even with bonds trading at a tenth of face value.
Robert Koenigsberger, whose first trade as founder of Gramercy in 1998 was scooping up battered Russian bonds, said Moscow had shown a surprising willingness to service external debts despite sanctions imposed over its actions in Ukraine. 
But Russia's capacity to pay is running out of road as systems for settling and clearing trades and transferring bond ownership titles break down, Koenigsberger told Reuters. 
""If I go call my clients and say country A is in default and it's trading at 25 cents and I think it's worth 50 - great. I'll take a look at it. 
""Try telling the same story on Russia. Nine out of 10 would say no and the tenth would say 'hell, no',"" the chief investment officer of the $5.5 billion fund said in an interview.
Russia calls its Feb. 24 invasion a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine, while Kyiv and the West say it is an unprovoked war of aggression. 
Prices on some Russian bonds that had been languishing at around 10 cents on the dollar quadrupled in recent days after the country paid coupons and swerved a default. Russia's 2043 bond for instance briefly hit 45 cents, up from 12 cents on March 8.
Those payments were possible due to a temporary U.S. licence authorising U.S. persons to receive payments on securities from certain sanctioned Russian government entities.
That exemption runs out on May 25, leaving in the balance nearly $2 billion in sovereign bond payments due until end-2022. 
While that deadline could be flexible, Koenigsberger reckons Russia will find it increasingly difficult to pay. Sanctions have also immobilised much of Russia's reserves warchest.
""What percentage of their debt service capability is tied up in other people's hands? I can't remember a time in history where there's been a negotiation of reparations where the side that is wanting to get paid is holding the cash,"" he said.
Gramercy is one of the best known among a breed of investors which specialise in buying beaten-up bonds and betting prices will recover or that they can take governments to court and win lengthy recovery battles.
Koenigsberger did not rule out ever buying Russian bonds, noting that Russia was forced in 1996 to settle pre-Revolution debt from the early 1900s before it could issue its first post-Soviet-era international bond.
""Russia might disappear for a long period of time but I would never say that the asset is worthless. The claim cannot be wiped out. But right now you would be buying a perpetual call option, not necessarily a bond,"" Koenigsberger said.
Russia will be ejected from major bond and stock indexes as of March 31, meaning investors may write down the value of their holdings to zero or try to offload them to anyone who will buy.
""You're going to see lower prices [on Russian bonds],"" he said, predicting more forced selling.
BUYING UKRAINE
Gramercy has instead been buying Ukrainian dollar bonds, paying prices in the low 20 cents on the dollar.
Koenigsberger said it would look to exit in the high 30s or low 40s ahead of a formal debt restructuring that he expected would see the bonds written down by 50%, in line with past such deals involving Western creditors in Eastern Europe.

""Ukraine will be massively supported by the West throughout and on the other side of this. That being said, I would expect that there will be a quid pro quo for that support,"" Koenigsberger added.
Ukraine's 2040 bond traded on Friday around 24 cents on the dollar, up from lows of 13 cents earlier this month.

Investing.com --  Honest Company  Inc (NASDAQ:HNST) shares plunged 28% Friday on the back of the company's quarterly report, which saw it miss earnings and revenue expectations.
The consumer goods company reported a loss per share of $0.10 on revenue of $80.38 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected a loss per share of $0.07 on revenue of $84.65 million. Revenue rose 3% year-over-year.
While the company's diapers and wipes segment and skin and personal care segment saw a rise in revenue, 16%, and 26%, respectively, its household and wellness segment declined $9.7 million, or 68%, in the fourth quarter. The company put the decline down to reduced COVID-19 related consumer demand for sanitizing and disinfecting products and face masks.
In a further blow to shareholders, the company sees 2022 revenue as being approximately flat compared to 2021, with first-quarter revenue anticipated to decline about 15%.
Honest Company CEO Nick Vlahos said they ""expect inflation and supply chain headwinds to continue to challenge the industry."""

Generali faces a power struggle over its board, with investor Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone putting up his own candidates for the top jobs. 
The following is a selection of reactions to a plan presented by the Caltagirone camp dubbed ""Awakening the Lion"" on Friday:
BNP PARIBAS EXANE
""14% EPS growth would not just beat the existing Generali plan, but would lead our entire sector. If you offer this to investors, you need to be prepared to back it up. We don’t feel we got that today. 
In particular, the 6-6.5% CAGR contribution from 'Business Enhancement' stretches credulity: example strategic opportunities in Health, SME and Asset Management are all-well-and-good, but strike us as incremental rather than game-changing.""
CITI:
""Significantly larger efficiency targets were presented, but poorly supported in our view, also with a tight delivery schedule and being revenue dependent. It was also unclear how higher IT spend would be expensed.
Overall we see this as a far more aggressive plan that would significantly change the investment case and risk profile in a challenging time for large scale, shareholder-friendly M&A.""
KBW
""We are pretty sure that Generali can do better. But we do not agree that the evidence is overwhelming that the current management team has failed, especially when we consider issues such as the Eurozone crisis and the need to recover financial flexibility that bedevilled the 2010s.""

EQUITA SIM
""Caltagirone said that in the insurance business Generali will have to look to growth in Europe and the East (China and India) and for growth in asset management in the U.S. These points had already been highlighted by Generali's current management in the business plan in December.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -General Motors Co said Friday it will idle for two weeks in April an assembly plant in Indiana that builds pickup trucks, over ongoing semiconductor chip shortages.
The Detroit automaker said it will halt production at its Fort Wayne assembly plant, which builds the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500, for two weeks starting April 4.
""There is still uncertainty and unpredictability in the semiconductor supply base, and we are actively working with our suppliers to mitigate potential issues moving forward,"" GM said Friday.
The automaker said this is its first semiconductor-related full-size truck production downtime since August. 
GM noted that overall it has ""seen better consistency in semiconductor supply through the first quarter compared to last year as a whole. This has translated into improvement in our production and deliveries during the first three months of the year."" 

GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra met with some lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week, including Republican Senator Todd Young of Indiana. 
GM is backing a bill in Congress to provide $52 billion in government subsidies to boost U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. GM said that legislation could help ""alleviate the ongoing shortage that continues to impact U.S. automotive manufacturing.""

MILAN (Reuters) -Rebel challengers to Generali (MI:GASI)'s current management pledged to increase earnings by a double-digit percentage and free more cash for takeovers, setting out their plans for Italy's largest insurer before a showdown next month.
Generali faces a power struggle over its board when shareholders vote on April 29, with investor Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone putting up his own candidates for the top jobs.
Caltagirone's camp set out their stall on Friday with a plan dubbed ""Awakening the Lion"", a reference to Generali's nickname ""The Lion of Trieste"", which features on its logo.
""Awakening the Lion"" is based on the observation of Generali's progressive and inexorable loss of competitiveness compared to its main European competitors,"" the plan said.
Caltagirone, who owns more than 9% of the company, wants to replace Frenchman Philippe Donnet, who has been CEO since 2016, and install Generali veteran Luciano Cirina in his place.
Cirina served as the company's head of Austria and CEE countries until he was suspended this week.
Caltagirone has also proposed former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Claudio Costamagna as chairman.
The challengers aim to boost earnings per share growth, including from acquisitions, to more than 14% over the 2021-2024 period. That compares with Generali's target of 6-8%. The rebels also want to reduce the cost-income ratio to 55% from 64%.
Another target is to lift the cash available for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to 7 billion euros ($7.7 billion), aiming for fewer but bigger deals. Generali's plan aimed for 3 billion euros.
'AMBITIOUS BUT ACHIEVABLE'
Appearing with Costamagna at a news conference in Milan on Friday, Cirina described the plans as ""ambitious but achievable"".
Generali hit back, saying that Donnet led the company to its best performance last year and that his latest plan, announced in December, had been received ""very positively"" by the financial market.
The outgoing board, backed by leading shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), has put forward Donnet for a third term as CEO and nominated Andrea Sironi, a leading international expert in governance and risk management, as new chairman. 
Caltagirone and fellow tycoon Leonardo Del Vecchio - Generali's second and third-largest investors respectively - are opposing the reappointment of Donnet as they challenge the influence of Mediobanca. 
About 35% of Generali's share capital is in the hands of institutional investors while small savers hold 23%, meaning their votes are likely to prove pivotal.
Generali said its slate of candidates would best serve investors.

""The board has presented a very solid list made of excellent and qualified individuals with international experience, who will work in the interest of all stakeholders and not to the benefit of specific shareholders,"" Generali said in a statement.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Friday after the U.S. and European Union agreed on a deal that will markedly increase shipments of U.S. liquefied natural gas to Europe.
On the one hand, the deal will help Europe to reduce its purchases of Russian energy, increasing the economic pressure on Vladimir Putin's government. On the other, it appears to signal that both sides are now prepared for a long and attritional hybrid war against each other that threatens to act as a drag on global growth for the foreseeable future. Ukraine's government again repeated Friday that Russia's demands for it to recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea and the breakaway eastern Ukrainian statelets established in 2014 are unacceptable.
The deal appears to achieve a decisive breakthrough in the struggle for the European gas market that has been fought over by the U.S. and Russia ever since the shale revolution and the launch of the Nord Stream pipeline project. Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG), the U.S.'s biggest pure-play LNG stock, rose 2.9% to another new all-time high. It's now up 46% so far this year.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 95 points, or 0.3%, at 34,803 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.3% but the Nasdaq Composite lagged with a gain of less than 0.1%.
The three main indices are on course for a second straight week of gains, having more than erased all their losses since Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago. However, the mood was clouded by fresh signs that the housing market is cooling under the impact of higher prices and rising mortgage rates. Pending home sales fell 4.1% in February, their fourth straight drop, to leave the pending home sales index at its lowest since July 2020. New home sales had also come in below expectations earlier in the week with a second straight monthly fall.
The Michigan Consumer Sentiment index also fell by more than expected to an 11-year low, overshadowed by record gasoline prices and the fading of last year's stimulus effects.
Among early movers, cannabis stocks stood out with sharp gains amid reports that the House of Representatives will again vote on a bill legalizing pot at the federal level. A previous attempt to pass similar legislation had failed due to opposition in the Senate. Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock rose 14%, while Aurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB) stock was up 5.2% and  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) stock was up 6.8%.
Elsewhere, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock rose 1.9% after Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder and activist investor Ryan Cohen said three new directors will join the retailer's board under a settlement hammered out between the two sides. The company will also look for alternatives for its buybuy Baby unit. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was left unmoved by a Bloomberg report that it is looking at allowing people to buy iPhones and other hardware through subscription models.
Elsewhere, investors again used the bounce in Chinese ADRs to exit from positions that may soon be complicated by U.S. delisting requirements. Nio (NYSE:NIO) ADRs fell more than 10%, after the electric vehicle also reported deliveries below expectations in the latest quarter.  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs were down 3.6% while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) ADRs fell 4.2%."

(Reuters) - Mutual funds that invest in emerging market (EM) equities and bonds have faced huge outflows over the past month, as the intensifying Russia-Ukraine crisis spawns fears over higher inflation and slower economic growth in these markets.
According to Refinitiv Lipper, a cumulative $8.1 billion has flowed out of EM equity funds and $5.73 billion from bond funds in the past four weeks.
This is in contrast to last year's heavy inflows, when EM bond funds received $232 billion, while EM equity funds obtained $103.4 billion. 
Among EM equity funds, the Emerging Markets Custom ESG Equity Index Fund E and Invesco Developing Markets Fund R6 led the outflows, with net sales worth $1.09 billion and $756 million respectively.
Emerging market nations are facing higher input costs as commodity prices soar due to an escalation in conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The two countries are leading exporters of a variety of commodities such as crude oil, gas, wheat and nickel.
According to data from Oxford Economics, China, India and South Korea are the biggest importers of crude oil among emerging markets. 
TD Securities estimates that a 50% increase in the average oil price would result in Asia's oil trade deficit widening by $240 billion this year.
""The increase in energy prices, and rising risk aversion due to the crisis in Ukraine fuels risks of capital outflows from the region at a time when current account positions are worsening,"" the brokerage said.
Brent crude oil was trading at $116.3 per barrel on Friday, having gained over 51% so far this year. 
The higher import costs are likely to hit economies with larger current account deficits, prompting further outflows from their bonds and equities, analysts say.
Colombia, Chile and Egypt have the biggest current account deficits as a percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP), according to data from Oxford Economics, which makes them more likely to borrow the money to pay for their imports. 
China, Turkey, Poland and South Korea have the biggest trade exposure with Russia among EM countries, according to the data.
Inflation has risen in many emerging market countries due to a surge in commodity costs, which has prompted some central banks to raise interest rates this year.
The National Bank of Hungary raised its base rate by 100 basis points to 4.4% on Tuesday, the biggest hike in the rate since 2008, saying rising energy costs and the war in Ukraine had fuelled inflation risks.
""High inflation continues to impede activity and while we expect price pressures to ease in the months ahead, substantial interest rate hikes during the past year will increasingly weigh on growth,"" Keith Wade, strategist at  Schroders  (LON:SDR), said in a note this month. 
""An important factor will be investors' appetites for Emerging Markets. This asset class has always promised but hasn’t always delivered,"" said Jerry Orosco, a portfolio manager at Intercontinental Wealth Advisors, based in Florida. 
The MSCI EM index has risen just 7.7% in the last 10 years, compared with the 130.9% gain in the MSCI World index. 
""EM equity has underperformed year-to-date and over 1, 3, 5, and 10 years. Investors growing impatient might favor the U.S. as a more stable market providing better long and short-term returns.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) and billionaire investor Ryan Cohen said on Friday that the two sides had reached a settlement where three new directors will join the housewares retailer's board and the company will look for alternatives for its buybuy Baby unit.
The two sides reached the agreement three weeks after Cohen, co-founder of online pet food company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and chairman of GameStop (NYSE:GME), said he wanted management and the board to consider other options, including a possible full sale of the company.
Marjorie Bowen, Shelly Lombard and Ben Rosenzweig will join the board immediately, expanding its size to 14 members before shrinking it back to 11 after the annual meeting, the company said in a news release. The three have expertise in the retail sector and strategic transactions. 
Cohen, who owns nearly 10% of Bed Bath through RC Ventures, became the latest activist to target the company when he said earlier this month that its strategy was too ambitious and that its management team was earning outsized paychecks for poor returns. In 2019, Bed Bath & Beyond settled with three activists and added four new directors to the board.
The company's stock price climbed nearly 6% in premarket trading on the news.
Two of the new board members added now will join a four-member committee focused on finding alternatives for the buybuy Baby unit, the company said. That committee began work earlier in the year, a source familiar with the matter said.

Bed Bath Chief Executive Mark Tritton said the company had always been ready to explore ""all options to maximize long-term shareholder value,"" adding that buybuy Baby is a ""tremendous asset"" and that management is ""committed to unlocking its full value.""
Cohen called the settlement a positive outcome for all shareholders and gave high marks to the company for having quickly embraced his ideas.

Shares of New Jersey-based Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) rose 5%, after the company added two of the directors would join a committee focused on exploring options for buybuy Baby, selling which Cohen believes would improve the company's focus.
The shares have surged ~37% since Cohen disclosed his nearly 10% stake in the company, taken through his investment firm RC Ventures LLC, and urged it to explore alternatives including separating buybuy Baby chain or a sale of the entire company.
The activist investor has criticized the retailer for an ""overly ambitious"" strategy, overpaying top executives and failing to reverse market share losses. 
In recent months, the company has buckled under pressure from supply chain issues and competition and seen its sales plunge in two of the three quarters reported last year. 
It is the second time the company has come under pressure from activist investors. In 2019, it reached a settlement with three activists and appointed four new directors, after the group criticized it for failing to reshape itself to meet consumers' growing preferences to shop online.
Cohen noted earlier that Bed Bath & Beyond Chief Executive Officer Mark Tritton, who was hired soon after the 2019 settlement, was paid far more than what top bosses earned at far bigger retailers including Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR).

China's  CNOOC Ltd  and CNPC agreed in 2019 to buy a combined 20% stake in the $25.5 billion Arctic-2 liquefied natural gas project led by Russian gas producer Novatek. 
Novatek has a 60% stake in Arctic LNG 2, while TotalEnergies holds 10% and Japan Arctic LNG - Mitsui & Co and state-run JOGMEC - with the final 10% stake. 
The 19.8 million tonne-per-year (tpy) project, one of the world's largest, is expected to export its first LNG cargo next year under the first train, with the second and third starting by 2024 and 2026.
Japan and France have frozen new investment in the project, Japan's Nikkei newspaper said on Friday.
Yamal LNG
CNPC in 2014 bought a 20% stake in the $27 billion Yamal LNG, another Russian LNG export facility in the Arctic operated by Novatek.
Novatek holds 50.1% in the 16.5 million tpy project, which began operation in late 2017. TotalEnergies holds 20% and China's state-backed Silk Road Fund 9.9%. 
Amur Gas Chemical Complex
Sinopec owns 40%, investing around $250 million in the $10 billion project controlled by privately owned Sibur, Russia's top petrochemical firm, which owns the remaining 60%. 
Sibur said in December the Amur GCC had secured $9.1 billion loans, including $2.6 billion from international banks with coverage from export credit agencies SACE of Italy and Germany's Euler Hermes, and $6.5 billion from Chinese and Russian banks.
The Amur plant is set to start producing 2.3 million tonnes of polyethylene and 400,000 tonnes of polypropylene per year from 2024, targeting China as a key market.
Sibur
China's state-run Silk Road Fund bought 10% stake in Sibur in 2016 after Sinopec acquired 10% in late 2015, according to Chinese media Caixin. 
Sakhalin-3 Veninsky oil project
Russian oil giant Rosneft and Sinopec agreed to jointly explore the Sakhalin-3 Veninsky block during a visit by China's then-president, Hu Jintao, to Moscow in 2005. It became China’s first energy project in Russia.
Sinopec owned as of 2007 25.1% in the oil project, controlled by Rosneft. 
As of 2009, Sinopec owned 49% of Russia's Udmurneft oilfield, also controlled by Rosneft. It was then Sinopec's largest oil-producing asset outside China. 

Beijing Gas 
In June 2017, Beijing Gas Group Co, the dominant natural gas distributor for the Chinese capital Beijing, closed a deal to pay $1.1 billion for a 20% stake in Rosneft subsidiary Verkhnechyonskneftegaz, which produces oil and gas in East Siberia.

LONDON (Reuters) - Surging European steel prices are set to extend their gains as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted logistics, spurred sanctions and sent energy prices soaring.
Russia is the world's fifth biggest steel producer, while Ukraine comes in at 14th. The two combined account for a fifth of imports to the European Union.
European hot rolled coil (HRC) prices have shot up by nearly 40% over the past three weeks. Prices in North America and China have also gained, but by much less, around 7-8%.
""It's certainly looking like prices will continue to rise in the short term. We're forecasting that prices will jump again by the end of this month and into April,"" said analyst Kaye Ayub at consultancy MEPS International.
""The supply side has been massively disrupted in Europe, and that will take quite a while to resolve.""
Russia and Ukraine punch above their weight in the global steel market due to hefty exports, especially to Europe.
""In Europe, pricing power is clearly still with the steel mills... as the loss of about 20% of finished steel imports from Russia/Ukraine tightens the market,"" UBS analyst Andrew Jones said in a note.
Even though Western nations have not specifically targeted Russian steel companies with sanctions, logistics problems and the knock-on impact of sanctions have disrupted businesses and shipments.
In addition to fears of losing supply from Russia and Ukraine, Europe is also having to contend with a surge in energy prices due to the conflict. 
Its steel sector was already grappling with high energy costs when Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February spurred another spike in the price of oil and gas, driving electricity prices higher. 
Electric furnaces for steelmaking account for just over 40% of Europe's output, higher than in other regions.
After hostilities broke out, steelmakers in Spain such as ArcelorMittal (NYSE:MT) and stainless steel producer Acerinox cut production, while Germany's Lech-Stahlwerke stopped output in Bavaria.

The full impact of the conflict has not yet shown up in production data, but European steel output in January had already declined to the lowest level seasonally since 2009, according to Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Michael Widmer. 
In February, crude steel output in the European Union fell 2.2% month-on-month and elsewhere in Europe dropped by 4.8%, data from the World Steel Association showed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Tesla Inc is recalling 947 vehicles in the United States because the rearview image may not immediately display when they begin to reverse, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.
The automaker told the NHTSA the recall covers some 2018-2019 Model S, Model X, and 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles equipped with Autopilot Computer 2.5 and operating certain firmware releases. The vehicles do not comply with a federal safety standard on rear visibility. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will perform an over-the-air software update to address the issue.
NHTSA said a delayed rearview camera image reduces the driver's rear view and increases the risk of a crash. This is the latest in a series of recalls Tesla has conducted for software issues in recent months.
Tesla on Dec. 19 https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2022/RCLRPT-22V169-2752.PDF began deploying firmware to a limited number of vehicles and its fleet monitoring tool soon ""identified an abnormal frequency of computer resets among Model 3 vehicles"" with that update, according to the recall notice dated March 18 but made public on Friday.
Tesla said ""over the following week, an engineering investigation into the condition identified a software error as a potential cause for further assessment."" 

Starting Feb. 9 after talks between Tesla and NHTSA to review consumer complaints that alleged delayed or unavailable rearview image displays, more than a dozen tests were conducted.
Tesla said that ""despite not finding a noncompliance in the tests that Tesla conducted, a recall determination was made out of an abundance of caution to recognize the potential presence of a noncompliance in affected vehicles.""

(Reuters) -London-listed Petropavlovsk will miss a loan payment due on Friday after Britain froze the assets of its main lender Gazprombank in its latest set of sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Russia-focused Petropavlovsk has agreements, including for loans and bullion sales with Gazprombank, which make it difficult for the miner to sell its gold and refinance loans now Britain has frozen assets the bank's assets.
The company is restricted from paying $560,000 in interest due on Friday on its $200 million term loan with Gazprombank, Petropavlovsk said.
Although Petropavlovsk itself has not been named in any of the Western sanctions to-date, it will be thrown out of FTSE indexes this month after many brokers refused to trade their shares in the miner and in others with Russian links.
Petropavlovsk shares sank more than 30% on Friday, adding to the over 85% loss in stock value since Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24. Moscow has called its actions in its neighbouring country a ""special military operation"". 
A Petropavlovsk spokesperson, who declined to comment beyond the company's statement, said the miner's debt portfolio consists of facilities with Gazprombank, a convertible bond and a eurobond, with no other bank loans at present. 
Western leaders have tightened sanctions on Russia as the attack on Ukraine entered its second month. That has had a knock on effect on companies with no apparent direct ties with sanctioned people or companies and hurt investor sentiment.
Petropavlovsk was founded by British businessman Peter Hambro and Russia's Pavel Maslovskiy in the 1990s. Its top investor is Russian businessman Sergey Sudarikov, who through his REGION brand of businesses disclosed a stake of just over 29% in the miner earlier this month, regulatory filings show. 

REGION is also a shareholder in the sanctioned Credit Bank of Moscow, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
Peel Hunt analysts in a note said the Gazprombank asset freeze also complicated Petropavlovsk's ability to refinance its bonds due in November.

The company sold 83.58 million shares, or around 25% of its total equity capital, valuing the company at just under $1 billion. A 15% greenshoe option is also part of the offer.
Braving choppy markets after a failed IPO attempt in Milan in 2019, it had set an indicative price range of HK$21.82–HK$28.24 per share for the float. 
The stock market debut is scheduled for March 31. 
Ferretti, which counts British fashion designer Jimmy Choo and former football star David Beckham among its customers, is a market leader for yachts with price tags from 4 million euros to more than 20 million.
The group is controlled by Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group and Pietro Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), son of the eponymous luxury sports car company's founder Enzo Ferrari, owns 11%. Ferretti produces under brands including Pershing and Riva and owns six shipyards in Italy.
Five Chinese cornerstone investors - Sunshine Insurance, Sanya Development, Hainan Free Trade Port Fund, Hainan Financial and Haifa Holding - have invested a total of $129.5 million. There is a six-month lock-up on the cornerstone investors.
The IPO was carried out while Hong Kong experiences major market volatility as a result of the Russian and Ukraine war, rising global interest rates and ongoing fallout from constant Chinese regulatory change. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is down 6.2% for the year and 3.4% for March, according to Refinitiv data.
Ferretti said it was confident the luxury boat industry would withstand any global economic downturn created by unfolding geopolitical events. 

It had said that it expected the value of the global yacht market to grow on average 7% a year, reaching 27 billion euros in 2025, with demand strengthening particularly in the Asia Pacific region.

(NYSE:NIO) reported relatively In-Line 4Q results, guiding for a ""stable 1Q22 delivery of 25-26k units vs. 25k in 4Q21"". However, the electric vehicle start-up said it could face production challenges in 2022 due to the continued shortage of chips.
""Chip supply is a big challenge [for us],"" William Li, co-founder and CEO said on Friday's earnings call. ""The main challenge is in some common and cheap chips, which will affect our production this year.""
According to Li, NIO uses around 1,000 different chips in each car, with approximately 10% of those chips facing supply shortages. Li said the supply of high-end semiconductors, such as Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Orin used to support the driver assistance system, was sufficient since NIO had already formed long-term partnerships with chip makers.
The shortage of chips has plagued the entire auto industry for quite a while now. It is no surprise that the car makers are setting guidance to accommodate. ""Based on this experience in 2021, we have already taken into consideration of the chip cost increase in terms of setting our target for the vehicle gross margin."" Li said during the call.
Apart from chip shortages, Li also said that rising prices of nickel and lithium could result in higher battery costs and affect its gross profit margin.

Ives believes China and Europe are tracking at least 15%+ ahead of consensus. Adding this to the U.S. Model Y demand and Tesla could be at a 2 million unit run-rate exiting 2022, Ives said.
The analyst said the current oil/gas price surge due to the situation between Ukraine and Russia has accelerated EV demand globally. He adds that many buyers sitting on the EV-fence will be coming over to market leader Tesla.
Ives believes Tesla's stock has been ""way oversold"" given the risk-off mentality among tech investors on Tesla's stock price. He sees a turn over the past few weeks as investors can better appreciate what the launch of Giga Berlin means for the Tesla supply story this year and going forward.
While China has been the key growth driver for Tesla, Ives said it looks like another ""breakout year"" with surging Model Y's demand.
The analyst reiterated an Outperform rating and $1,400 price target on Tesla.

HYDERABAD, India (Reuters) - India's civil aviation minister urged Indian airlines on Friday to add more long-haul aircraft to their fleets and to increase flights abroad, as air travel rebounds from a two-year slump due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Domestic passenger numbers are expected to exceed pre-pandemic levels within one year, Jyotiraditya Scindia said during an air show in the Indian city of Hyderabad.
But foreign carriers dominate international routes to and from India, which industry experts say is partly because Indian carriers do not have enough widebody, long-haul planes.
""Along with our thrust on narrow body aircraft, we must also increase our fleet of wide body aircraft. It is not enough to connect all points in India, we need to connect the world to India,"" the minister said.
India's aviation market is dominated by narrowbody planes operated by low-cost carriers like IndiGo. In 2019, Indian airlines operated more than 550 narrowbody planes and less than 60 widebodies.
Only two Indian airlines fly to long-haul destinations - Air India, the former state-run carrier acquired by Tata Group, and Vistara, a venture between Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and Tata.
Middle Eastern, European and other carriers take the bulk of passengers from India leaving domestic airlines with a small share of the international market.
This is partly because Indian carriers do not have enough widebody planes to compete, Remi Maillard, president and managing director at Airbus for India and South Asia, said at the air show, making a pitch for the Airbus A350 long-haul jet. 
Maillard said he expected-long haul travel from India to grow ""massively"" in the next decade which would drive demand for bigger planes. 

The European planemaker projected India would need 2,210 new planes to meet growing air travel demand over the next two decades, with widebody planes accounting for 440 of them. 
Airbus' rival Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co now dominates the widebody market in India.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The president of China's Bank of Communications Co Ltd (BoCom), on Friday warned it will be difficult for the lender to deliver satisfactory earnings this year.
""This year has been the most complex year in my nearly 30 years in this business,"" bank president Liu Jun told a news conference following BoCom's annual results.
Liu cited challenges including the resurgence of COVID in China, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and its impact on supply issues, inflation and other domestic difficulties. 
COVID is currently spreading in a number of China's largest cities, such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, leading to partial lockdowns of airports, districts and inter-province travel.
Other difficulties the country is facing include a crackdown on the property sector, which has led to near-defaults by a number of developers.
The bank reported a full-year profit rise of 11.9% on Friday, beating estimates.
China's sixth largest commercial bank by assets reported a full year net profit of 87.6 billion yuan, above an average estimate of 83.1 billion from 18 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
The non-performing loan ratio at BoCom was 1.48% by the year-end, compared to 1.6% three months ago, while the net interest margin (NIM), a gauge of bank profitability, stood at 1.56%, compared to 1.55% by the end of September, the bank said in an exchange filing.
The bad loan ratio at large commercial banks fell to 1.37% by the end of December, the lowest since the third quarter in 2019, while NIM steadied at 2.04%, data from the banking and insurance regulator showed. 
The commercial banks made a total of 2.2 trillion yuan net profits in 2021, a 12.6% increase from 2020, according to the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. 

BoCom reported a fourth-quarter net profit of 23.2 billion yuan ($3.65 billion), a 9.2% drop from 25.6 billion a year earlier, Reuters calculations showed.

94,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 07:22AM ET</span>","Drugmakers, scientists begin the hunt for long COVID treatments","By Jennifer Rigby and Julie Steenhuysen
(Reuters) - After producing vaccines and treatments for acute COVID-19 in record time, researchers and drugmakers are turning to finding a cure for long COVID, a more elusive target marked by hundreds of different symptoms afflicting millions of people. Leading drugmakers, including those who have launched antiviral pills and monoclonal antibodies for COVID-19, are having early discussions with researchers about how to target the disease, five scientists in the United States and UK told Reuters. Companies including GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Vir Biotechnology (NASDAQ:VIR) and Humanigen confirmed they had spoken to researchers on trials using their current treatments against long COVID. Others including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Roche said they are interested but would not elaborate on plans. Researchers, biotech companies and public health experts say major pharmaceutical companies are integral to getting a proven treatment for the disease, which currently afflicts more than 100 million people, according to the World Health Organization.
""When you look at the numbers for heart failure, for diabetes, etc, that is the ballpark we are talking about,"" said Amitava Banerjee, a leading researcher on a long COVID trial.
Long COVID, with some 200 reported afflictions that include fatigue, chest pain and brain fog, is defined by symptoms that last longer than 3 months. It sidelines people who have had both mild and severe COVID-19, including children. In the United States, it is estimated to have affected 1-in-7 working age adults. Sandi Zack, 53, a former elementary school teacher from the Atlanta area who can no longer work, described symptoms including extreme fatigue, dizziness, pain and heart palpitations since contracting COVID in December 2020. She has sought help from a range of specialists and tried a variety of drugs to ease her symptoms including steroids and the antidepressant fluvoxamine.
“We’re all still out here,” she said. ""Hoping, and waiting.” There are fewer than 20 clinical trials underway testing drugs, a handful of which have moved beyond early stages, according to interviews with more than a dozen independent and government-backed scientists and a Reuters review of a global clinical trials database.
Scientists hope their research will uncover the causes of long COVID, a major hurdle in finding targets for new drugs or identifying existing medicines that may work as treatments. “We are getting to the stage where we are getting traction, and for people suffering, we are getting treatments tested,” said David Strain, a University of Exeter Medical School lecturer whose research has informed which treatments will be tested in a major British trial. “Hopefully we will have things we can we offer them to get their lives back to normal in the near future.” Big pharmaceutical companies are looking for disease-specific biomarkers that would allow them to assess the value of tested medicines, experts say. “What they’re struggling with is a case definition for long COVID,” said Dr. Amy Proal, an expert in post-viral diseases at the PolyBio Research Foundation in Mercer Island, Washington. She said she has held confidential meetings with two venture capital groups and one major pharmaceutical company. Possible underlying causes researchers are studying include damage from the original infection, lingering reservoirs of virus in the body, an autoimmune response, in which the immune system attacks its own cells, and a dysregulated immune response causing excess inflammation that damages small blood vessels or nerves. It could be a combination of those or other factors, they say. 
SEARCHING FOR A CURE AND FUNDING
One major UK-funded trial led by University College, London, will test four drugs among 4,500 long COVID patients.
They include antihistamines loratadine and famotidine, the gout and heart inflammation treatment colchichine - all available as generics - and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)'s blood clot preventer Xarelto (rivaroxaban). 
All have data from preliminary studies in people suggesting they could work against some of the possible disease targets for long COVID, such as inflammation and blood clots.
Banerjee, lead researcher on that trial, said the drugs will target several potential underlying mechanisms of long COVID while seeking to understand more about them.
“It’s challenging, because we’re going for a hazy target,” he said in a phone interview. “People on the industry side are trying to figure it out too.”
U.S-based Axcella Therapeutics is working with the University of Oxford in the UK on a drug developed for nonalcoholic steathohepatitis (NASH), a liver disease marked by dysregulated metabolism, inflammation and scarring.
In long COVID, the hope is the drug will restore the normal function of mitochondria - the energy factories of cells. Poorly functioning mitochondria may explain the crushing long-term fatigue so many patients experience.
As lead researcher Dr. Betty Raman put it, if COVID damaged the battery, the drug aims to restore that battery, so cells can perform their normal functions without using up too much energy.
PureTech Health, another U.S. biotech, is running a midstage trial of an experimental pulmonary fibrosis treatment aimed at preventing long-term lung scarring linked with COVID.
In Seattle, researchers at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson COVID Clinical Research Center are testing Resolve Therapeutics' experimental treatment targeting fatigue in long COVID patients.
The drug works by dissolving certain RNA in the blood that has been linked with increased inflammation in patients with autoimmune diseases such as Lupus and Sjogren's syndrome, said Dr. James Andrews, a rheumatologist at the University of Washington who is leading the trial.
Scientists who believe the root cause of long COVID could be lingering virus are keen to test whether existing COVID-19 treatments or vaccines could have an impact.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is donating its vaccine for early trials in the UK testing whether it can help kickstart the immune system and ease long COVID symptoms, the company said in an emailed statement.
Funding has been a struggle for some companies.

Berlin Cures Holding AG, a German biotech, secured only enough money for the first stage of testing of its autoimmune drug - previously used for heart failure - that has shown promise in a handful of patients when used experimentally.
“People call us and they cry on the phone,"" Chief Operating Officer Peter Goettel told Reuters. ""Some people want to sell their house to give us donations, just to get a shot.”

96,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 07:16AM ET</span>",Explainer-How the China Eastern crash investigation will be carried out,"By Jamie Freed and Allison Lampert
(Reuters) -China has launched an investigation into the crash of a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) jet that plunged rapidly from cruising altitude into a mountainside with 132 people on board.
The crash of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 is China's first deadly aviation accident since 2010 in a country that has had one of the world's strongest safety records over that period.
There are international standards governing some parts of air crash investigations, but the practical management of them differs by country.
China will lead the investigation because the crash occurred on its territory, and the United States has the right to participate because the plane was designed and manufactured there.
CHINA'S CHAIN OF COMMAND
China's State Council, the cabinet led by Premier Li Keqiang, has set up an investigation team led by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the Ministry of Emergency Management. The search and rescue response also involves multiple other ministries.
The aviation safety office of CAAC, which has an accident investigation department, is leading the technical work.
The State Council oversees major industrial accidents and natural disasters, giving it a more direct political oversight element than crash investigations in places like the United States.
Zheng Lei, chair of the aviation department at Australia's Swinburne University of Technology, said the high-level involvement signified the government was taking the situation seriously and would also help improve cooperation throughout China's extensive bureaucracy.
CAAC only operates at the vice minister level, he said, so the State Council would allow for minister-level involvement.
HOW DOES CAAC COMPARE WITH FOREIGN COUNTERPARTS?
CAAC performs a dual role as the aviation regulator and crash investigator, whereas the United States splits those roles between the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NSTB).
U.S.-based aviation analyst Robert Mann said he was unconcerned by CAAC's dual role given it is common elsewhere. The United Arab Emirates and the Philippines, for example, do not split the roles.
Christopher Hart, a former NTSB head, said he believes it is important to have separate agencies because the factors behind accidents often include errors and omissions by the regulator that may be less likely to be included in a final report written by that regulator.
However, a State Council report into China's last deadly crash, involving a Henan Airlines Embraer regional jet in 2010, did point out deficiencies in CAAC oversight.
WHEN WILL CHINA RELEASE MORE INFORMATION PUBLICLY?
Under international standards, a preliminary report into an accident needs to be lodged with U.N. aviation agency ICAO within 30 days. 
Such initial reports tend to be factual and brief, laying out the information known to date from maintenance records, air traffic control recordings and the black boxes if found, rather than a cause of the crash. 
There is no requirement to make the preliminary report public, though Indonesia, Ethiopia, Pakistan and Iran have done so in more recent crashes. India did not publicly release a preliminary report into a deadly 2020 crash of an Air India Express plane.
Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said he hoped CAAC produced a public 30-day report given the global interest. 
Mao Yanfeng, a CAAC official, on Friday told reporters that the investigation team will follow international and Chinese rules in submitting the 30-day report to ICAO, but he did not say whether it would be made public.
A final report is due within a year, according to ICAO guidelines, though sometimes they can take longer.
China is the world's biggest operator of 737-800s with more than 1,200 in service, so it could release any broader safety information involving the model more quickly, analysts said.
WHAT STEPS DOES CHINA TAKE AFTER AIR CRASHES?
In most countries, an accident report makes safety recommendations to the airline, regulator and manufacturer as appropriate but does not assign blame or call for punishment.
Prosecutions can occur after a crash.
The State Council's final report into the 2010 Henan Airlines crash recommended demotions and demerits for many airline and regulatory officials and prosecution of the captain, who survived the crash that killed 44 of the 96 people on board.
Professor Zheng of Swinburne University said a punitive approach was common in China, where there was a desire to see the people responsible punished when accidents occurred.

""I think that's the convention, just to remind people about their accountability for the area they are looking after,"" he said.

97,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 07:10AM ET</span>",Farm equipment makers cut pre planting season production as U.S. inflation bites,"By Bianca Flowers
(Reuters) - Howard Dahl stopped taking farm equipment orders from customers as a shortage of parts and labor and escalating inflation threatened profits for his North Dakota-based firm Amity Technology.
He did so even as high crop prices suggested strong demand for the sugar beet and silage machinery his company makes ahead of spring planting season. 
""Normally we begin selling equipment in early November,"" said Dahl. ""Largely because of the uncertainty of the supply chain, we limited what we were going to build.""
A shortage of raw materials saddled manufacturers with increased costs even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices sky-rocketing and darkened the global inflation outlook. Now, overall costs of materials for Dahl have jumped 21% year over year through March while the price of steel has doubled, putting him in a delicate situation to price equipment and control costs. 
Bigger equipment manufacturers are also fighting to protect margins after farmers flush with cash have helped them book record profits over the past year.
Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co said on a recent earnings call it would be pausing advance orders for equipment not already in stock, though it maintains a positive outlook for margin growth. 
""Our order books across all of our businesses are mostly full for the year, except in a few cases where we paused orders to allow for more dynamic pricing,"" said John May, Chief Executive Officer, on the call.
Rival CNH Industrial (NYSE:CNHI) told Reuters it is following suit. 
""With high inflation, we're being careful how far out we go,"" Chief Executive Officer of CNH Industrial, Scott Wine, said in an interview. ""If [input] prices rise too much, we're not going to sell something and lose margin.""
Farmer income is expected to drop by $5.4 billion from 2021, according to the U.S Department of Agriculture, as federal aid payments given during the pandemic ease. But tractor sales remained solid in February as farmers eye high crop prices, increasing 9.2% from the same time a year ago, the Association of Equipment Manufacturer's latest report showed. 
Still, inflation has companies weighing to what extent they can pass costs on to consumers. As prices of raw materials continue to rise, companies may need to find other alternatives to cushion the impact on big price-tag equipment like tractors and keep margins intact, analysts say.
The global chip shortage had led automakers to bring production on key parts like electric vehicle batteries in house, while also moving to lock in the supply of key materials like lithium through longer-term contracts or even investments in mines. 

For Dahl, miscalculating inflation has proven to be costly. Now, all cards are on the table to preserve profits. 
""We did not raise our prices quickly enough, so we’ve had some profit erosion, said Dahl who has increased prices by 18% since last June. ""There's only a couple of components that we're single-sourced on so we're taking a hard look at all alternatives.""

101,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 06:11AM ET</span>",Inside China's electric drive for swappable car batteries,"By Paul Lienert, Nick Carey and Norihiko Shirouzu
DETROIT/BEIJING (Reuters) - A year ago Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) dismissed the alternative path of electric car battery swapping as ""riddled with problems and not suitable for widescale use"". It seems Beijing disagrees.
In fact, China is pushing hard for swappable batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) as a supplement to regular vehicle charging, with the government throwing its weight behind several companies advancing the technology. 
Four companies - automakers Nio (NYSE:NIO) and Geely, battery swap developer Aulton and state-owned oil producer Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) - say they plan to establish a total of 24,000 swap stations across the country by 2025, up from about 1,400 today.
Battery swapping allows drivers to replace depleted packs quickly with fully charged ones, rather than plugging the vehicle into a charging point. Swapping could help mitigate the growing strains placed on power grids as millions of drivers juice up, yet specialists caution it can only take off in a big way if batteries become standardized industry-wide.
If China is successful in making swapping successful on a large scale, though, the shift could undermine the business models of global brands like Tesla, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors (NYSE:GM), whose EVs are designed for and powered by their own proprietary batteries and, in Tesla's case, its own charging network. 
Even slight changes of fortune in the country can have significant consequences for these carmakers, whose futures rely on achieving success in the world's largest car market. 
The Chinese swapping plans, announced piecemeal in recent weeks and months but not widely known outside the domestic auto sector, are part of Beijing's broader plan to make 25% of car sales fully electric by 2025, or more than 6 million passenger vehicles based on current forecasts. Estimates vary widely as to how many will have swappable batteries.
The Ministry of Industry and Information (MIIT), a major supporter of battery swapping, did not immediately respond to a request for further comment about China's battery swapping strategy
Furthermore, big Chinese players are also looking overseas.
Ningde-based CATL (Contemporary Amperex Technology Company Ltd), the world's biggest battery maker, told Reuters it was developing swapping services not only for China, but ""to meet the demand of global markets"".
""We are accumulating experience in the Chinese market and at the same time communicating closely with overseas partners. You'll receive more concrete information soon,"" said CATL, which supplies about half of China's market and more than 30% of the battery cells used in EVs globally.
Nio, among China's top EV makers, plans to offer U.S. customers battery-swapping services by 2025, the company's North American head Ganesh Iyer said. It has more than 800 swap stations in China and has just set up its first in Europe.
'NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN'
Such plans clash with the views expressed by global EV pioneer and leader Tesla in March 2021 when it dismissed the viability of large-scale battery swapping in China. It trialed swapping in the United States years ago and abandoned it.
Industry executives are divided over whether China's push can overcome the reluctance of European and U.S. automakers to abandon their own battery designs and adopt standardized ones.
""You'll never ever get carmakers to agree to swappable batteries,"" said Andy Palmer, former CEO of Aston Martin and currently head of EV maker  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) Mobility. 
John Holland, wireless EV charging company Momentum Dynamics' commercial director for Europe and the Middle East, said convergence on batteries created a quandary for automakers.
""Then how do you differentiate your product?"" 
Tesla, GM and Volkswagen say they are not exploring battery swapping right now.
A GM spokesperson told Reuters that swappable batteries ""are not part of our strategy at present.""
A VW spokesperson said the company originally considered battery swapping to avoid waiting times at charging stations, but that advances in fast charging and the lower costs of non-swappable batteries had led it to shift focus to the latter.
""Nevertheless, our strategists closely monitor and evaluate the competitive environment and all developments in this area,"" the German carmaker said.
A Tesla spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Swapping and regular grid-charging both have critics and cheerleaders in a rapidly evolving auto tech arena.
The ease of exchanging batteries in e-scooters has been demonstrated in Asia and Europe, but the challenge is adapting the technology to larger and more complex cars, trucks and vans. See accompanying short story:
Concerns about the length of swapping times have also faded, with Nio saying it has automated the process so it takes as little as 180 seconds.
Yet the more familiar grid-charging side has a huge head start, and is bolstered by the fact there's already billions of dollars' worth of charging infrastructure built globally.
Automakers are also rolling out EVs with improved batteries that boast longer ranges and shorter charge times, which could make swapping obsolete.
'BIGGEST GAME IN TOWN'
In China, MIIT released the global auto industry's first standards for swapping technology last year. They went into effect in November, specifying safety requirements, test methods and inspection rules for EVs with swappable batteries.
The ministry aims to have more than 100,000 battery-swappable vehicles and more than 1,000 swap stations, in total, in 11 cities by 2023; stations in the bigger cities will accommodate both passenger and commercial vehicles, while outlying provincial cities will focus on electric heavy-duty trucks.
Yet a key uncertainty for China's ambitions is whether enough carmakers adopt standardized batteries, an obstacle that scuttled attempts at battery swapping in the last decade - yet, if overcome, could propel the technology to a viable scale. Read a short history of swappable batteries: 
There's a long way to go. Even the swapping option offered to customers by Nio uses the company's own batteries, thus limiting the service to people driving Nio cars equipped with the company's proprietary batteries.
CATL, which helped Nio develop swappable batteries, has signed up China's FAW Motor as the first customer for its new Evogo battery swapping service and expects to extend the service to other Chinese automakers. 
CATL wants domestic firms to accept its standard battery design so its stations can service models from multiple brands, according to a person close to the company who declined to be named due to commercial sensitivities, adding that it expected more car brands to adopt its standardized designs.
The company is ""the biggest game in town"" for EV batteries, said Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights. 
""They can offer a large footprint for swapping stations and a low cost to use those stations,"" he said. 
Meanwhile, among those Chinese companies building out swap station networks, Shanghai-based Aulton New Energy Automotive Technology has said it is working with automakers to develop standardized batteries, and with Sinopec to install stations at 30,000 Sinopec gas stations in China by 2030. 
Aulton didn't respond to a request for comment.
MAGIC IN AMERICA?
While international carmakers may resist swappable batteries, they are reliant on Chinese sales to fund their costly transition to electric and will have little choice but to adapt to the market there, according to many industry experts.
Furthermore, if Beijing ultimately mandates swappable batteries ""and starts saying, 'okay, the only car you're allowed to produce is one that meets the standard' . . . you would have to comply to stay in business"" in China, says John Helveston, assistant professor at George Washington University's School of Engineering.
Some advocates of swapping are looking beyond China.
Battery swapping ""is too convenient, too economical and too logical for this not to happen at scale in Europe and the United States,"" said Levi Tillemann, head of policy and international business at San Francisco-based battery swap startup Ample.
""It's a sort of magical thinking to imagine that this is a uniquely Chinese phenomenon,"" he added.
Ample, one of just a handful of battery swapping developers outside China, has raised $275 million from investors, including energy companies Shell (LON:RDSa), Repsol (OTC:REPYY) and Eneos, boosting its valuation to $1 billion.

It is running pilot programs with Uber (NYSE:UBER) and car rental startup Sally, and says it is collaborating with several unnamed automakers.
""With a relatively small number of vehicles that are heavily utilized, we can deploy and operate a battery swap system profitably,"" Tillemann said. ""So fleets are a prime target for us.""

WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Recovery crews on Friday expanded the search area of the China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) crash, as the second of the plane's two black boxes eluded search-and-rescue workers for a fourth day.
Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming to Guangzhou on the coast on Monday when the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 plummeted from cruising altitude at about the time when it should have started its descent to its destination.
Human remains and personal belongings of the 132 people on board have been found but no survivors, and debris from the crash was scattered over a wide area of the heavily forested slopes in China's Guangxi region. 
It was the first major air disaster in China in a dozen years, and while the cause of the incident remains unknown, it has prompted the government to reinforce safety checks in aviation and other industries.
""The search area has now been expanded to 200,000 square meters,"" Lao Gaojin, a local government official, told a news conference, adding that 2,248 local residents had joined the search and rescue on Friday. 
The other black box - the cockpit voice recorder - was found on Wednesday, and has been sent to Beijing for examination by experts.
It could take 10 to 15 days to arrive at a preliminary analysis, and longer before a final conclusion can be presented in a report, according to Chinese state media. 
""Currently, we cannot determine the exact time needed for the data downloading and analysis of the black box already recovered,"" said Mao Yanfeng, an official at the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), adding that the exterior of the device had been damaged. 
The crash investigation is being led by China but the United States was invited to take part because the Boeing 737-800 was designed and manufactured there.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday that Chinese authorities had invited the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to take part in the investigation, adding that he was very encouraged by the invitation to be on the ground in China.
The NTSB, however, later said it had not yet determined if investigators would travel to China in light of visa and quarantine requirements. 
It would be important for the NTSB to be able to participate in the downloading of the cockpit voice and data recorders, said Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
""Just for the sake of openness, whenever you do a download, it's important to have other parties in the room,"" he said.
DISTRAUGHT
More than 200 distraught family members of the 132 people on board the doomed flight have since visited the crash site. 
""Rescue workers have so far found human remains, collected 18 samples of finger prints and 101 pieces of personal belongings of the passengers,"" said Lao. 
More than 230 experts have also been taking DNA samples from family members at the scene as well as from the crash site, he said. 
Debris from the jetliner including engine blades, horizontal tail stabilisers and other wing remnants was concentrated within 30 metres (90 feet) of the main impact point, which was 20 metres (60 feet) deep.
A 1.3 metre-long fragment suspected to be from the plane was found about 10 km (six miles) away, prompting a significant expansion of the search area. 

According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, the plane briefly appeared to pull out of its nosedive, before plunging again.
Authorities said the pilots did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers during the rapid descent.

Telenor in May 2021 wrote down the value of its Myanmar business by 6.5 billion crowns ($751 million) and later said it would be sold for $105 million to Lebanese investment firm M1 and local firm Shwe Byain Phyu.
""Telenor has received $50 million at closing. The remaining $55 million shall be received in equal instalments over the coming 5 years,"" it said.
""Due to the uncertain situation in Myanmar, the deferred payment will not be recognised in the accounts at closing.""
The sale, prompted by last year's military coup in the Southeast Asian country, has been criticised by some Myanmar civil rights groups and Norwegian politicians who fear it puts the data of 18 million people within the junta's reach.
Telenor, which last week received approval for the sale from Myanmar's rulers, says the firm had to leave the country to adhere to its own values on human rights and responsible business, and because local laws conflict with European laws.
Telenor will book an accumulated loss of around 800 million crowns in its first-quarter accounts stemming from a reclassification of items it had previously accounted for.
It will also see a negative cash flow impact of 1.5 billion crowns resulting from the ""derecognising of the cash balance in Telenor Myanmar and the proceeds received at closing"", the company said.
Reuters reported in February that Shwe Byain Phyu, whose chairman has a history of business ties to the military, will own 80% of the Myanmar operation while M1 will own the rest.
Shwe Byain Phyu has denied ties to the Myanmar army and previously said it was ""selected by Telenor ... because it was the most unrelated to the military"".

109,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2022 04:15AM ET</span>",Vistara looks to lessors to fill long-haul gap amid 787 delays,"By Aditi Shah
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian full-service airline Vistara is in talks with lessors about getting long-haul planes to cover a gap left by delays in Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 deliveries, chief executive Vinod Kannan said.
Vistara, owned by Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and India's Tata Group, is waiting to receive four aircraft from Boeing's 787 production line, but deliveries have been frozen globally since May 2021 due to quality-control shortcomings.
To provide substitute capacity in the short term, Vistara is talking to lessors about renting 787s, Kannan said in an interview with Reuters.
""There is enough availability (of airliners) in the market because there are still parts of the world where flying has not come back,"" he said, adding that the company is yet to make a final decision on whether to rent aircraft.
Kannan said the market was too volatile to consider ordering new planes right now. But, in the longer run, Vistara could also consider buying Airbus A350s, he said. 
Vistara has about 50 aircraft, including two 787-9s received before the delivery suspension and a mix of Airbus and Boeing narrow-body airliners. It plans to take 20 more aircraft by the end of 2023, mostly A320s to be used domestically and for nearby international destinations.
Expanding its footprint globally is a priority for Vistara, which began operations in 2015 but has not yet made a profit. India's domestic market is dominated by low-cost carriers, such as IndiGo. International flying offers stronger pricing.
The airline's losses narrowed last fiscal year, and Kannan said he had seen a further improvement until February, when fuel prices spiked. While demand is growing and air fares are moving higher, it will be difficult to offset higher fuel costs and the burden of a depreciating rupee, he said.
FLYING INTERNATIONAL
Vistara's international operations - reaching about a dozen foreign cities, such as London, Paris and Frankfurt - comprise around 25% of its capacity. It wants to expand this to 35% over the next two years and is looking at direct flights to the United States, South Korea and Japan, Kannan said.
""A lot of the long haul depends on aircraft availability. This is the time to capitalise, especially with India opening up international travel,"" he said.
Tata this year acquired Vistara's direct competitor, Air India. Kannan said the two airlines are exploring how they can cooperate without violating competition rules.
Vistara began looking at international expansion before the pandemic but paused as air travel came to a near halt in 2020. Now high fuel prices and Russia's invasion of Ukraine are forcing it to look again at its plans. 

The airline operated charter flights to such places as Hong Kong and Moscow during the pandemic. But Hong Kong is now closed to visitors and Moscow is ""out of the question"", Kannan said.
""With fuel price where they are, we have to think twice in terms of whether we need to bring on those additional aircraft,"" he said. ""But we know that not just the U.S., but all these long-haul points are important.""

Ian Won, acting manager of the FAA aviation safety office that oversees Boeing, asked the U.S. planemaker in a letter dated March 21 to provide a ""mature certification schedule,"" according to a source familiar with the letter. Won also sought updates on progress for both the 737 MAX 10 and 777-9.
Both airliner designs are under development. Certification is needed before they can enter service.
""With regard to the current Boeing Model 737-10 program maturity, the FAA is concerned it will be significantly challenged to meet the directive"" of Congress in 2020, Won wrote, the source said.
Won's letter referred to the 2020 law known as the Aircraft Certification, Safety, and Accountability Act, which reformed how the FAA certifies new airplanes. The law sets a late-December 2022 deadline for imposing a new safety standard for cockpit alerts.
Only Congress can extend the deadline if the FAA does not certify the 737 MAX 10 before the end of the year.
Boeing has raised with some lawmakers the potential impact on jobs and production if the aircraft is not approved, Reuters reported last week.
The 737 MAX 10 is longer than earlier 737 MAX narrow-body airliners. The 777-9, a wide-body aircaft, is the initial version of an updated 777 design known as 777X.
In May 2021, the FAA told Boeing that, realistically, it would not certify the 777X until mid- to late 2023.
Boeing said Thursday it continues ""to work transparently with the FAA to provide the information they need and remain committed to meeting their expectations, including regarding 777-9 and 737-10 certification.""
The Seattle Times first reported https://www.union-bulletin.com/seattle_times/faa-tells-boeing-it-doubts-max-10-will-meet-safety-standard-deadline/article_a549d7f4-a780-5335-99f2-4d22125de908.html the existence of the letter.
The FAA letter also asked Boeing for an update on its expected dates for major milestones needed before the planes can win certification and enter commercial service.
Won warned existing certification schedules for the 737 MAX 10 and 777-9 ""are outdated and no longer reflect the program activities"" as understood by the FAA, the source said.

Asked if Boeing had an updated schedule, Boeing said it has ""no updates to share beyond our previous estimates. We are working to provide official documentation of specific milestones within the certification program in accordance with the FAA’s request.""
The FAA said Thursday it does not comment on ongoing certification projects.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a mixed fashion Friday, ending the week on a cautious note as the Ukraine war rages on and energy prices remain elevated. 
At 3:10 AM ET (0710 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.2% lower, the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%, while CAC 40 futures in France rose 0.3%.
The war in Ukraine, sparked by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, has already killed thousands of people and driven around 3.6 million abroad, according to data from the United Nations.
Western leaders denounced Moscow's invasion as barbaric after talks in Brussels on Thursday, with the U.S. warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin could resort to the use of biological or chemical weapons as his campaign struggles.
Weighing on the European markets Friday was weakness in Asia overnight, with tech stocks being particularly hard hit in Hong Kong on renewed fears that many will be forced to delist in the United States.
Back in Europe, British retail sales surprisingly dropped 0.3% on the month in February, registering annual growth of 7.0%, as the country’s important retail sector struggled to bounce back from the COVID-inspired restrictions of late last year.
Also of interest will be the release of the German Ifo business climate index for March, due later in the session, as a guide of the strength of the Eurozone’s largest economy.
Oil prices stabilized at high levels Friday, with traders keeping a wary eye on the discussions between European Union countries over a potential embargo on Russian oil as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.
So far, the EU has not blocked the importation of Russian crude into the bloc, unlike the U.S., but as the war drags on, there’s likely to be a growing willingness to use Russian energy supplies as a weapon.
Elsewhere, the United States and its allies were said to be discussing a possible further coordinated release of oil from storage.
By 3:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.1% higher at $112.36 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $119.16. Both contracts were still on course for their first weekly gains in three weeks, with Brent around 10% higher and WTI up 7%.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,955.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1027."

Investing.com – China’s JD (NASDAQ:JD) Logistics Inc. (HK:2618) has priced new shares for its HK$8.53 billion ($1.1 billion) capital increase. However, the shares were priced at a discount of about 10% to Thursday’s closing price of HK$23, with each share pricing at HK$20.71, according to a Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX) filing.
JD Logistics’ Hong Kong shares tumbled 13.04% to HK$20 by 12:32 AM ET (4:32 AM GMT).
The issuance was the company’s first since its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in May 2021. The funds will be used to fund potential acquisitions, as well as increase cash reserves, said the company. Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) were the deal’s joint book-runners.
The deal also consisted of a placement of about $700 million worth of shares to JD Logistics’ parent company, JD.com Inc. (HK:9618), and about $400 million in a primary share sale, according to Thursday’s filings. JD.com holds a 63.5% stake in  JD Logistics  .
Of stocks on offer, 80% went to the top 15 investors who bid during the bookbuild, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The deal was the also first follow-on share sale in Hong Kong since Feb. 21 and was also the biggest since  Sunac  China Holdings Ltd.'s (HK:1918) $580 million top-up placement in January 2022. It is also the third-largest follow-on deal in Asia and fifth globally in 2022 to date, according to Refinitiv data.
It also comes came amid continued volatility in Asia Pacific shares, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index down 6.5% in 2022 to date."

ACAPULCO, Mexico (Reuters) -Citigroup's retail unit in Mexico, known as Citibanamex, has said it hopes to define the terms of its sale in April, amid signs of intensifying interest in the bank, expected by analysts to fetch between $4 billion and $8 billion.
Citi country head Manuel Romo told reporters on Wednesday the unit would open its ""data room"" next month to those it thinks meet the necessary requirements to launch a bid for the bank, which Citi chief executive Jane Fraser announced for sale in January.
""We're doing this in a timely and appropriate manner,"" Romo said in a press conference ahead of the country's annual banking convention, which is taking place in Acapulco for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic hit.
Earlier this week, Mexican bank Banorte said that, if it decided to go forward with a bid, it would invite ""all Mexicans"" to take part in the purchase.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said he wants to see investors ""Mexicanize"" the bank.
On Thursday, Lopez Obrador said he ""will not put up any obstacles"" to the sale but underscored that his preference would be for the bank to be in Mexican hands.
Lopez Obrador has mentioned several Mexican magnates, such as Ricardo Salinas, who controls Banco Azteca, and Carlos Hank Gonzalez of Banorte as potential buyers. 
In February, Romo said that Citibanamex could be sold directly or through an initial public offering, but that the bank wasn't open to selling it piecemeal.
He said the sale, which could take up to two years, had received interest from banks and non-banks, both local and foreign. 

Analysts have priced Citibanamex from $4 billion to $8 billion, though Citi, which acquired the bank for $12.5 billion in 2001, has yet to put a price tag on it.
Paco Ybarra, chief executive officer of the Institutional Clients Group at Citi, will steer the sale from New York, Romo said Wednesday.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Friday morning, with investors continuing to calculate the resilience of the global economic recovery to risks from both a tighter U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy and the conflict in Ukraine.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 inched down 0.01% by 10:20 PM ET (2:20 AM GMT), with data released earlier in the day showing that the Tokyo consumer price index (CPI) for March 2022 grew 1.3%, and the Tokyo core CPI grew 0.8%, year-on-year. The CPI Tokyo excluding food and energy grew 0.2% month-on-month.
South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.17% and in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.40%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was down 0.25%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched down 0.06% and the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.13%.
The impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, including elevated and volatile raw-material costs, continues. The U.S. also warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could resort to dangerous methods, such as using biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons, as his military campaign struggles and Western sanctions continue to bite.
The gap between the Fed’s recent hawkish stance and the Bank of Japan’s more dovish stance has sapped the yen, which is near a six-year low against the dollar. Yen weakness could also potentially spur yuan depreciation, according to Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA strategist Albert Edwards.
Global shares are set to record their first consecutive weekly gains in 2022, a sign of cautious optimism that economic growth will weather the conflict in Ukraine, high inflation, and the Fed’s monetary policy moves.
The Fed’s steps to contain inflation are “what ultimately will drive a more aggressive inversion of the curve, which we think is coming quite quickly,” Columbia Threadneedle Investments global head of fixed income Gene Tannuzzo told Bloomberg.
That doesn’t necessarily signal a recession, since “this is a very different cycle and the first one in over 30 years where the Fed is playing catch-up to inflation,” he added.
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Thursday that he is “comfortable” with hiking interest rates in quarter-point increments and was “open” to a 50 basis-point move if needed.
Meanwhile, although the U.S. 10-year yield was still near levels last seen in 2019, key parts of the U.S. Treasury yield curve continue to flatten or are inverted. The moves are leading to debate as to whether the bond market is signaling a steep economic slowdown or even a recession ahead.
The yield on the two-year Treasury note is set for its biggest quarterly advance since 1984.
While the price action in Treasuries has been brutal, that does not mean a decades-long bull market in bonds is over, DeCarley Trading founder Carley Garner told Bloomberg.
“Inflation is the story now, but inflation has tended to be something that can change very quickly. It spikes and then it violently and quickly reverses the other way and generally triggers a recession while we’re at it,” she said."

It was also the third-largest follow-on deal in Asia and fifth globally this year, according to Refinitiv data.
The share sale came despite ongoing volatility in regional equities markets, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index down 6.5% this year.
The top 15 investors who bid during the bookbuild were allocated 80% of the stock that was on offer, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to discuss the deal.
JD.com did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deal's composition.

JD Logistics said it would use the money raised to help fund potential acquisitions and build up its cash reserves.

(Reuters) -Meta Platforms Inc will make it easier for brands to run three-dimensional ads on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram social media platforms through a new partnership with an ecommerce technology firm.
The integration with VNTANA will allow brands to upload the 3D models of their products to Facebook and Instagram and easily convert them into ads, VNTANA said on Thursday in a press release. 
The move is a stepping stone into advertising in the metaverse, said VNTANA Chief Executive Ashley Crowder, referring to the futuristic idea of a collection of virtual worlds that can be accessed through devices such as headsets.
Meta has staked its future on contributing to the building of the metaverse, which it has said could take up to a decade to be realized.
Meta previously partnered with augmented reality (AR) companies Modiface and PerfectCorp to help beauty and cosmetic brands more easily run 3D and AR advertising.
""The metaverse is basically the spatial internet,"" Crowder said. ""It is a whole world of possibility that starts with having the right 3D models of your products.""
Facebook and Instagram users who see a 3D ad while browsing on their desktop or phone can interact with an image of a handbag, for instance, and move it around to view the item from all angles.

""In a way, this offers a glimpse of what you might expect on future devices like AR glasses,"" said Chris Barbour, director of augmented reality partnerships at Meta's Reality Labs unit.
Before VNTANA's integration with Meta, advertisers would need to reformat 3D files to be compatible with Meta's ad systems. Now, brands can use VNTANA to easily upload and convert the files into ads without technical expertise in working with 3D images, Crowder said.

124,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 08:15PM ET</span>",Banks undermine their 'net zero' pledges through lobbying - report,"LONDON (Reuters) - Thirty of the world's largest financial institutions are undermining their commitment to cutting carbon emissions by lobbying against climate regulation and by funding new fossil fuel projects, according to a report published on Friday.
The report, from London-based energy and climate think-tank InfluenceMap, found that all 30 institutions are members of industry associations ""that have consistently lobbied to weaken key sustainable finance policies"" in the European Union, Britain and the United States. 
These policies are designed to boost transparency around financing environmentally harmful activities including fossil fuels.
One well-known activist investor and climate campaigner said the behaviour amounted to ""greenwashing"". 
""Any bank making a Net Zero promise whilst actively lobbying against necessary climate regulation – such as mandatory disclosure of borrowers' emissions and climate action plans – is greenwashing,"" Chris Hohn, the billionaire founder of hedge fund TCI, said in a quote provided by InfluenceMap. 
""Shareholders should vote against the directors of banks who are hiding their exposure to climate risk.""
Many banks have committed to a 'Net Zero' 2050 target and several have promised to reduce their direct greenhouse gas emissions, as well as those of their clients, to keep the rise in global temperatures from pre-industrial levels below 1.5 degrees celsius.
Those that are members of the United Nations-convened Net Zero Banking Alliance, which includes global banks such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) and HSBC, have also begun to announce specific targets for lowering their financed emissions in industries such as oil and gas by 2030. 
Some experts have called the targets a good start and argue that lenders will need to continue working with fossil fuel giants during the energy transition. Many activists say the pledges do not go anywhere near far enough.
InfluenceMap said that though many banks have committed to substantial decarbonisation targets, few have adopted ""meaningful fossil fuel exclusion policies"". 
It calculated that of the 30 financial firms it examined, their banking arms collectively facilitated at least $740 billion in primary financing to fossil fuel-related businesses in 2020 and 2021. This was mostly through corporate lending and bond underwriting. 

""These global financial institutions have significant economic and political influence, and they are delaying action that is essential to respond to the climate crisis,"" said Eden Coates, the report's author. 
""If they are serious about achieving their net zero targets, they should set concrete and actionable short-term targets across all aspects of their operations.""

User reports complaining of iMessage outages on Downdetector.com started climbing shortly after 4:20 p.m. ET, and later hit over 1,100.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was hit with similar outages earlier this week that knocked off services like its mobile App Store and music streaming service. 
The company did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons for the recent outages.

Apple's corporate staff working from home and retail workers also faced tech issues on Monday due to domain name system (DNS) issues, according to Bloomberg News. 
In a number of incidents last year, issues with DNS - an address book of the internet which enables computers to match website addresses with the correct server, caused widespread outages on social media platforms including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram, and brought down websites of airlines and banks for several hours.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday told appellate judges that video game maker Epic Games had failed to show any legal error that would justify them overturning a lower-court ruling that found key App Store policies do not break U.S. antitrust law.
Epic, known for its ""Fortnite"" game, largely lost a trial last year over whether Apple's payment rules for apps were anticompetitive. That decision found Apple had suitable reasons to force some app makers such as Epic to use its payment system and take commissions of 15% to 30% on their sales.
Following the ruling, Epic appealed in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Apple in its reply on Thursday said Epic had failed to propose a reasonable alternative to the App Store policies.
""Epic asks the Judiciary to fundamentally change the App Store by forcing Apple to abandon the integrated distribution and digital-content delivery model that, among many other procompetitive benefits, helps safeguard user security and privacy,"" the court filing said.
Both Apple and Epic are scheduled to file a second round of arguments before the appeals panel calls a hearing, for possibly next year.
In support of Epic's appeal, attorneys general for 34 U.S. states and the District of Columbia said in January that Apple is stifling competition through its mobile app store.
Outside arguments in support of Apple are due next Thursday.

Experts and critics of the lower-court decision have said it is striking that the judge found Apple had broken California's unfair competition law but not federal antitrust law.
Similarly, Apple in its cross-appeal on Thursday questioned how it could be held liable under state law if its practices were not found illegal under federal law.

The Hershey plant, located at the foot of the Blue Ridge mountains in Stuarts Draft, Virginia, has around 1,400 employees and primarily makes products with peanuts, including Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and other candy bars like Almond Joy.
Hershey in the lead up to the vote, whose counting and preliminary result were live-streamed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Thursday, created a website to state it did not want a union at the 40-year-old plant. 
The website highlighted Hershey's perceived risks associated with unionization, including compromising its ability to recruit workers. It also pointed to the plants being open when a few rivals had furloughed employees during the pandemic.
Two Hershey workers interviewed by Reuters, one of whom was recently fired after 14 years at the Virginia plant, said it was difficult to get time off work and they sometimes had to work seven days straight.
One of the workers, who requested anonymity due to potential retaliation, said forming a union was not about money and benefits but being treated with respect and dignity.
Hershey, whose two out of seven U.S. plants are unionized, also said most people who left the plant said they did so due to a lack of time-off rather than pay. It added its attendance policy ""needed some work"" and a team was looking at simplifying rules related to time-off and absences.

Hershey and the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union (BCTGM) did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the result.
A few Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shops, however, have unionized in the past few weeks, while workers at King Soopers and Kellogg (NYSE:K)'s cereal plant have gone on strikes in recent months to secure better contracts.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's surprise political deal with the smaller left-leaning New Democrats will lead to heftier deficits and threatens to upend the Liberal government's promise to rein in runaway inflation, economists said.
Trudeau on Tuesday announced a rare written ""supply-and-confidence"" agreement that will see the NDP prop up his minority government until 2025 in exchange for more social spending.
Top of the list is a dental-care program for low-income Canadians and a national prescription drug plan, both of which will likely be costly, permanent spending initiatives, economists said. Details of the two programs should emerge in the federal budget due to be presented next month.
With the Canadian economy already at capacity and price pressures mounting, incremental spending - even if merited - could complicate efforts to keep inflation expectations moored, said Rebekah Young, director of fiscal and provincial economics at Scotiabank. 
""The finance minister risks further undermining Ottawa's credibility in its commitment to tackling inflation,"" she said. 
Young expects the pact, which has been denounced by the main opposition Conservatives, will lead to an additional C$15 billion-C$20 billion ($12 billion-$16 billion) in government spending over the life of the three-year deal and potentially C$40 billion in total by fiscal 2026-2027.
The jump in tax revenue resulting from surging inflation will likely mask much of the new spending in the near term, she said, but the deal could add half a percentage point to structural deficits over the medium term.
Fitch Ratings stripped Canada of one of its coveted triple-A credit ratings in June 2020. S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service still give Canadian debt their highest ratings.
The federal government's COVID-19 pandemic support programs have already pushed Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio to a projected peak of 48.0% in 2021/2022 from 30.9% in 2018/2019. It could decline more slowly from there due to the increased spending.
""It does look like it would open the pocket books at the federal level,"" said Pedro Antunes, chief economist at the Conference Board of Canada.
Canada, like other countries globally, is grappling with red-hot inflation, which hit a three-decade high of 5.7% in February. At the same time, businesses are scrambling to hire enough workers to meet booming demand.
New federal dental and prescription drug programs would require more specialized workers, who may demand higher wages, which could then create another round of inflation, Antunes said. 
""We can start getting to that vicious spiral that we don't want to be in,"" Antunes said. 
DEFENSE SPENDING
The Liberals pledged C$78 billion in stimulus over three years during last year's election campaign. The NDP's platform had priced a national drug plan at C$38.5 billion over five years and C$11 billion for dental coverage.
Spending under the deal will likely look quite different. 
With Canada's economy firing on all cylinders, analysts say the center-left Liberals should be focused on balancing the budget rather than adding stimulus so businesses do not grow concerned about the possibility of higher taxes.
""The right path is to grow the economy to pay for new spending measures – not the other way around,"" said Robert Asselin, senior vice president of policy at the Business Council of Canada. 
Adding to swelling expenses is the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which may prompt Canada to boost defense spending.
""Our investments in our Canadian Armed Forces will continue to increase and we will have more to say about this at the appropriate time,"" said Trudeau, speaking at a summit in Brussels to address the Ukraine crisis. 

Trudeau said his deal with the NDP will not impact defense spending plans.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may have to change their core business practices in Europe as EU countries and EU lawmakers on Thursday clinched a deal on landmark rules to curb their powers.
France, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, said in a tweet that there was a provisional agreement after eight hours of talks. 
EU industry chief Thierry Breton said in a tweet that the deal would ensure fair and open digital markets.
""What we want is simple: fair markets also in digital. Large gatekeeper platforms have prevented businesses and consumers from the benefit of competitive digital markets,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager, who proposed the rules just over a year ago, said in a statement.
""This means that the time of long antitrust cases, during which the authorities were lagging behind the big tech companies, is over,"" said EU lawmaker Andreas Schwab, who had steered the debate in the European Parliament.
The Digital Markets Act (DMA) sets out rules for online gatekeepers - companies that control data and platform access.
It will cover gatekeepers in online intermediation services, social networks, search engines, operating systems, online advertising services, cloud computing, video-sharing services, web browsers and virtual assistants.
Under the DMA, the tech giants will have to make their messaging services interoperable and provide business users access to their data. Business users would be able to promote competing products and services on a platform and reach deals with customers off the platforms. 
The rules prohibit the companies from favoring their own services over rivals' or preventing users from removing pre-installed software or apps.
The DMA will apply to companies with a market capitalisation of 75 billion euros, 7.5 billion euros in annual turnover and at least 45 million monthly users. 
Companies face hefty fines up to 10% of their annual global turnover for breaching the rules and as much as 20% for repeat offences.
Apple, which has lobbied intensively against the DMA, reiterated its worries.
""We remain concerned that some provisions of the DMA will create unnecessary privacy and security vulnerabilities for our users while others will prohibit us from charging for intellectual property in which we invest a great deal,"" it said in a statement.

Google, which also cranked up its lobbying in the last year, echoed the same sentiments.
""While we support many of the DMA's ambitions around consumer choice and interoperability, we're worried that some of these rules could reduce innovation and the choice available to Europeans. We'll now take some time to study the final text, talk with the regulator and work out what we need to do to comply,"" it said in a statement.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 07:21PM ET</span>",Factbox-Swapping electric car batteries since the Gilded Age,"By Paul Lienert and Nick Carey
(Reuters) - Battery swapping - replacing a depleted battery with a freshly charged one - is not new: The first experiments with exchanging batteries in electric cars date to America's Gilded Age in the late 1890s, according to industrial historian David A. Kirsch.
Here is a timeline of key events in the development of battery swapping:
1896: Auto pioneers consider the exchange of depleted batteries with fresh ones as a way to extend the operating range of early rudimentary electric vehicles, from streetcars to delivery trucks.
1912:  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co teams up with local partners in Connecticut to launch a ""battery service"" that enables electric vehicle owners to swap batteries for a modest monthly fee and a variable per-mile charge. Other similar services spring up in large cities. Semi-mechanized swaps take as little as three minutes at some stations. And by separating the battery from the vehicle, the service helps lower the initial cost by a third or more.
1924: General Electric's GeVeCo battery service is discontinued. Waning demand for electric vehicles and the lack of interest in industry-wide battery standardization stall further development of electric vehicle battery swapping for more than 80 years.
2007: Silicon Valley startup Better Place develops a ""battery switching"" process and signs up Renault-Nissan for pilot projects in several countries. 
2008: The Beijing Olympics showcase a fleet of 50 electric buses featuring swappable batteries. China's Wanxiang demonstrates an electric bus with swappable batteries at the Games.
2010: Better Place is invited to meet with officials of the state-owned China Grid to discuss battery swapping. China Grid ends the talks without a deal.
2013: The same issues that helped kill the decades-earlier GeVeCo serefvice, notably lack of interest by consumers and vehicle manufacturers, catch up to Better Place. After raising - and burning through - more than $600 million in investors' money in just six years, the company files for bankruptcy.

2013: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) offers a limited battery swap service for the new Model S, which was designed from the start to accommodate swappable batteries. The swapping process is arduous (""a pain in the ass,"" recalls a former Tesla executive) and the pilot program is quietly retired in 2015. Tesla CEO Elon Musk orders his team instead to turn its attention instead to building out a proprietary network of charging stations called ""superchargers.""
2014: Nio (NYSE:NIO) is established in China, with satellite operations in the United States and Europe. In 2017, it announces a plan to offer customers the option of swappable batteries, a service that it begins in 2018.

131,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 07:11PM ET</span>",E-scooters fall head over wheels for battery swapping,"By Nick Carey and Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - While swappable batteries are slow-burners in the electric car market, they have been a quick hit for e-scooters and e-bikes, making it easier and cheaper for rental companies to keep the small vehicles available on city streets. 
But the fast-growing micromobility industry faces a bottleneck as companies, reluctant to relinquish their own tech secret sauce, resist widespread standardization of batteries, a development that could turbocharge efficiency.
When e-scooters first hit the streets in large numbers a few years ago, major providers like Dott and Tier had to shove their scooters into vans daily and haul them to suburban warehouses to charge overnight - adding to urban congestion and meaning those scooters were not out on the streets ready to rent. 
Most major providers have since adopted swappable batteries in a global micromobility market where revenue was under $3 billion in 2019 before the pandemic hit and could hit $10 billion in 2025, according to industry estimates.
""Swappable batteries have been a game changer for us,"" said Tinia Muehlfenzl, vice president of market development for Berlin-based Tier. ""We didn't have to collect the entire scooter anymore to charge them, we could do it right there on the street."" 
Micromobility providers now send out crews on electric cargo bikes or in electric vans to swap batteries during the day. That keeps the scooters or bikes in circulation and cuts down on congestion.
In London, Dott workers like Zhelyo Kolev, who travels around in an electric Maxus van, say they can check tires and brakes or undertake minor repairs while replacing batteries in seconds.
Swappable batteries are now such a feature of Europe's micromobility landscape that cities look favorably on them in tenders for operators to launch e-scooter and e-bike services because they reduce congestion and emissions.
TECH DILEMMA
But like major automakers, some e-scooter and e-bike providers have little desire to give up their own battery technology in the interest of standardization, which would enable large public swapping stations where consumers could swap out their own batteries. 
The process is easier for batteries that can weigh around 5 kg, a fraction of those in electric car batteries which can weigh 500 kg. 
Tier's Muehlfenzl said the company was in favor of standardization. But she acknowledged that for everyone, Tier included, giving up their own battery technology for a common industry standard is tough and will take time to agree on. 
""It would be very tricky because, where would you start and where would you end?"" she said. ""You'd need to apply your own infrastructure to standards you don't own and maybe don't know.""

Mina Nada, chief executive of Zoomo, an Australian provider of electric delivery bikes, said that increasing regulation and industry consolidation would likely lead to more standardized e-bike batteries - or at least standardized charging systems.
""It's going to be difficult to get to complete standardization,"" he added. ""But I also see a path toward consolidation and less variability than what we have today.""

By Peter Hall
MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - A consortium comprising investors Todd Boehly, Hansjorg Wyss and Jonathan Goldstein has been shortlisted in the auction for English Premier League club Chelsea, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
Chelsea was put up for sale by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, stating proceeds would go to charity. He was sanctioned by Britain this month, so the winning bidder for Chelsea would need to be greenlighted by the government.
The value of the offer made by the group led by Boehly -- a former Guggenheim Partners president whose investment firm Elridge now invests in several businesses -- could not be learned. 
Other bidders are expecting to hear back from U.S. bank Raine Group, which is overseeing the sale, on whether they had made a narrowed shortlist, sources said. Bid revisions have slowed the process.
The Financial Times reported on Thursday that the consortium led by private equity veterans Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who own sport teams including the National Basketball Association's Philadelphia 76ers, also made the shortlist. They would have to divest their 40% stake in Crystal Palace, another English football team, were their bid for Chelsea to succeed. 
Saudi Media have not made the shortlist, an advisor to the group told Reuters, while Sky News reported that other bidders including Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets, had also been eliminated.
Hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns AC Milan, has joined the Nick Candy-led Blue Football consortium as a ""minor investor"" in their bid for Chelsea, sources close to the bid said.
Elliott has injected a ""multi-million pound sum"" into the bid, the sources told Reuters. 
British property developer Candy's bid was increased on Monday after being joined by ""another large Korean financial institution"", the parties said in a statement, with sources adding the consortium grew further on Thursday. 
Elliott bought AC Milan in 2018 and has since helped the Italian giants become much more competitive in Serie A. The team is topping the standings, chasing their first league title in 11 years.
Candy had initially been joined in his consortium by South Korean companies Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Limited before the new investors got on board.
SAUDI MEDIA MISS OUT
An advisor to Saudi Media Group told Reuters their bid for Chelsea had been rejected and they had been informed by Raine that they were not on the shortlist.
They added that the bid, which was headed by businessman Mohamed Alkhereiji, who is reported to be a season ticket holder at Chelsea, would be open to linking up with another consortium that does make the shortlist.
Sources close to the process said Chelsea do not want to deal with Saudi money due to potential complications and controversy which could add an extra hurdle to a fast-track sale.
Others who have made their offers public include Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family as well as the pairing of former Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton and World Athletics President Sebastian Coe.

London-based global investment firm Centricus also said they had offered to buy Chelsea, a move driven by co-founder Nizar Al-Bassam and CEO Garth Ritchie, who are reported to be season-ticket holders.

The House vote is symbolic, as the debate will show how much House GOP support there is for cannabis. Cannabis legislation is not about the House, it is all about the Senate. No matter what happens in the House next week, it cannot force the Senate to act.
According to Jaret Seiberg from Cowen, the Senate won't take up the MORE Act as there are not the votes there to legalize cannabis. He anticipates nearly every Democrat to back the MORE Act, while Republicans decision is unclear, as the MORE Act includes social justice provisions that some Republicans may oppose.
Around the sector, Tilray, Inc. (NASDAQ:TLRY) gained 22%,  Canopy Growth  (NASDAQ:CGC) gained 11%, and Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL) gained 23%.
Seiberg said they are more interested in the debate than the actual vote, as it will show how many Republicans support legalization even if they object to the MORE Act, noting that there is a high probability that Republicans will control the House next year. Seiberg highlighted the possibility of the House going Republican but Democrats managing to keep control of the Senate, which would mean there would be a path for cannabis legislation next year.
Seiberg doesn't view this vote as impacting the future of the SAFE Act on cannabis banking, with House Democrats knowing the Senate wont legalize and viewing SAFE as the best opportunity to enact a cannabis bill. SAFE gets broader Senate GOP support as it is also framed as a public safety bill, which makes Seiberg believe SAFE remains likely to become law in this Congress. Regarding the question of it expanding to include capital markets access, Seiberg sees a window for such a deal though it may depend on macro threats like Russia and inflation to ease. Otherwise, Congress may be too distracted, which means a narrower SAFE Act is more probable.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 climbed Thursday as chip stocks led a broad-based rally in tech and the strongest jobless claims report in decades pointed to underlying strength in the economy.
S&P 500 rose 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, or 244 points, the Nasdaq rose 1.2%.
Chip stocks jumped more than 4%, led by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the latter's chief executive Jensen Huang said the company would be interesting in using Intel to source its chips.
Some on Wall Street are skeptical, pointing out that Nvidia is unlikely to risk its competitive edge by allowing a rival to produce its chips. 
“[W]e see little likelihood that NVDA would choose to fab prominent products at arguably its most significant competitor's facilities, a choice that would provide Intel with an early look at NVDA's future chip design,” Wedbush said in a note.
The broader tech sector was also helped by ongoing strength in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) after the social media giant confirmed plans to build a hyperscale data center in the north Kansas City area.
Sentiment on risk assets was also supported by data pointing to economic strength as jobless claims fell to its lowest level since 1989.
“It [the labor market] is extremely strong and this data is exactly the sort of evidence that has given the Fed confidence that they can raise rates more quickly to battle inflation,” Jefferies said in a note.
Durable goods orders, however, fell by a more than expected 2.2% last month, though economists were quick to downplay the weakness, estimating a rebound was likely ahead.
“It seems reasonable, given firms’ sky-high investment spending intentions, to think that March will see a clear rebound,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The backdrop of stronger economic data offset rising geopolitical tensions as the U.S. and its allies look to further isolate Russia as the latter’s ongoing conflict with Ukraine rolls into the fifth week.

Investing.com – Stocks finished higher on Thursday lifted by chip stocks as oil prices fell and President Joe Biden met with NATO allies on the situation in Ukraine.
Biden said the allies would respond to Russia if it used chemical weapons on Ukraine, which it invaded one month ago today. The president also called for Russia to be removed from the G-20 group of countries.
The allies, which met in Brussels, agreed to shore up their forces in Eastern Europe to hold Russia at bay. They are sending more aid to Ukraine and trying to raise the pressure on Russia with economic and other sanctions.
In the, U.S. new data showed last week’s claims for unemployment reached a low not seen since 1969, as the Federal Reserve starts out on a series of interest rate hikes to calm hotter than expected inflation.
Some Fed officials want more aggressive action on rates, raising them at half-point increments rather than the customary quarter-point hike such as the Fed did last week. But others on the policy committee cautioned against being too aggressive. 
Reuters reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would seek payment in rubles for gas sold to ""unfriendly"" countries, comments that rocked energy markets, but Europeans like Italy’s president, said they would continue to pay in euros.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Biden in Europe
Biden told reporters at a press conference in Brussels that he was also working to ensure China doesn’t come to Russia’s aid, saying he has talked to President Xi Jinping and emphasized the severe consequences if China were to help. China’s economic interests, Biden said, were more focused on the West than Russia. 
On Friday, Biden travels to Poland, a NATO member that has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees.
2. Fed outlook
Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said Thursday that the central bank needs to raise rates this year and next to tame inflation before it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. But he also said the Fed should be cautious.
""I just think that we want to be careful"" not to raise interest rates too abruptly, and instead take the time to assess whether supply chains are improving and how the war in Ukraine is affecting the economy, Reuters reported him saying.
3. Uber moves
 Uber Technologies Inc  (NYSE:UBER) will begin listing New York City taxis on its app, a change in direction for the ride-hailing giant, which for years has faced opposition from taxi groups. 
The change in course comes as part of a deal with Creative Mobile and Curb to offer more transportation options. It also helps to ease the company's struggles with driver availability.

The dollar rose for the fourth time in the past five sessions, as economic data on the U.S. labor market helped firm expectations that the Fed will be more aggressive in taking steps to curb inflation. 
The dollar index rose 0.15%, with the euro down 0.05% to $1.099.
""The sharp hawkish repricing of Fed rate hike expectations has mainly benefited the U.S. dollar against low yielding currencies whose own domestic central banks are expected to lag well behind the Fed in tightening policy,"" MUFG currency analyst Lee Hardman wrote in a note to clients. 
HAWKISH
U.S. Treasuries resumed their sell-off Thursday, driving bond yields higher, also prodded by the fresh labor market data and pressure on the Fed to hike rates.
Top Federal Reserve policymakers have all week signalled they stood ready to take more aggressive action to bring down decades-high inflation, including a possible half-percentage-point rate hike at the next policy meeting in May. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari added on Thursday he has pencilled in seven quarter-point interest rate hikes this year, but warned against going too far.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was up 4.2 basis points to 2.363%; the two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was up 1.3 basis points at 2.126%. 
Crude prices slid around 3% on Thursday after the European Union could not agree on a plan to boycott Russian oil and on reports that exports from Kazakhstan's Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal could partially resume.
After rising more than 5% on Wednesday, U.S. crude fell 3.13% to $111.33 per barrel and Brent was at $118.01, down nearly 3% on the day.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) market analysts estimated that it would take a sustained oil price increase to $200 per barrel to produce an income shock similar in magnitude to those that precipitated U.S. recessions in the 1970s.

""While we cannot rule out such an outcome, $200 is considerably above our commodity team’s upside-risk estimate of $165,"" they wrote in a note late on Wednesday. 
Gold rose to a more than one-week high on Thursday as concerns over soaring prices and uncertainty surrounding the war in Ukraine lifted bullion's appeal as a safe-haven and an inflation hedge. Spot gold added 0.9% to $1,961.43 an ounce.

142,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 04:30PM ET</span>",Bayer reaches $80 million PCB contamination settlement with Ohio,"By Tom Hals
(Reuters) -  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) reached an $80 million settlement with Ohio to resolve environmental damage allegedly caused by polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, made by the company's  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON) business, the state attorney general said on Thursday.
The funds from the German company, which did not admit liability, will be used for environmental cleanup, the attorney general said.
Monsanto, which Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) acquired for $63 billion in 2018, never manufactured PCBs in Ohio or discharged them into Ohio waterways, Bayer said in a statement.
PCBs were once used widely to insulate electrical equipment, and were used in carbonless copy paper, caulking, floor finish and paint. They were outlawed by the U.S. government in 1979 after being linked to cancer. 
Bayer has been trying to resolve a number of lawsuits related to Monsanto's PCBs, which were used in commercial products from 1935 until 1977, when Monsanto voluntarily ceased production. 
In addition to reaching legal settlements with states, the company reached a $648 million proposed class action settlement with about 2,500 cities and other local governments eligible as members of the class. Last week the agreement received preliminary approval from a federal judge. 
Class members must decide whether to support the deal, object to the terms or opt out and pursue their own case, as the city of Los Angeles did earlier this month.
Bayer can withdraw from the settlement if more than 2% of the class members opt out.

Bayer also faces personal injury cases stemming from PCB exposure. 
Two separate juries last year awarded a combined $247 million in damages stemming from exposure in a school in Washington state. Bayer said the evidence showed the plaintiffs were not exposed to unsafe levels of PCBs and the company said it planned to appeal both verdicts. (This story corrects paragraphs 5 and 6 to show there are about 2,500 members eligible for the class action, not thousands of separate lawsuits)

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher on Thursday fueled by a rally in chip stocks against the backdrop of a day of intense diplomacy in Brussels, where the U.S. is trying to cajole Europe into putting more economic pressure on Russia to stop its war in Ukraine.
By 4:18 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 349 points, or 1%, while the S&P 500 rose 1.4% and NASDAQ Composite was up 1.9%. All of the three main cash indices had faltered on Wednesday after a week of solid gains; the market has digested the risk of faster monetary policy tightening and the prospect of a global economic slowdown due to the war in Ukraine.
President Joe Biden is attending summits of both NATO and the G7 and will also be at a meeting of EU leaders later in the day, which may or may not yield fresh sanctions on purchases of Russian energy exports. The meetings are taking place a month to the day after Russia invaded Ukraine, triggering sharp sell-offs in equity markets and an equally sharp squeeze in oil, metals, and agricultural commodities - all of which are heavily influenced by the availability (or otherwise) of Russian exports. Newsflow from the battlefield continues to show intense fighting, with Russia claiming to have captured Izyum, an important rail junction town near Kharkiv, and Ukrainian forces crippling at least one Russian landing ship that was supplying the troops besieging the port city of Mariupol.
The domestic news slate, by contrast, is relatively thin, although more Federal Reserve officials will weigh in with fresh comments on the need to tighten monetary policy further. Jobless claims for last week hit a low not seen since 1969.
Washington's focus remains on the confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson.
Crude oil futures turned lower, as the tough fighting and the prospect of extra Western help for Ukraine coming out of the day's summits increased the likelihood of the conflict dragging on. Any sign of further restrictions on European buying will force importers to chase barrels elsewhere on the global market. French major TotalEnergies (NYSE:TTE) said late on Wednesday that it, too, will stop buying Russian crude by the end of the year, after coming under intense pressure for not announcing that step at the same time as Shell (LON:RDSa), BP (NYSE:BP) and other European companies. The company still intends to buy Russian gas, however.
By 2:18 PM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 3% at $111.47 a barrel, while Brent crude was down 2.9% at $118.03 a barrel.
Gold futures rose 1.2% to $1,961 an ounce.

LONDON (Reuters) - Buyout firm Pamplona Capital Management said on Thursday it would liquidate every fund where Mikhail Fridman's investment group LetterOne had any interest as it seeks to sever ties with the sanctioned Russian tycoon. 
LetterOne is one of Pamplona's limited partners (LP) and was set up almost a decade ago by Fridman and Petr Aven.
The pair stepped down from LetterOne in early March following Russia's invasion of Ukraine but Pamplona decided to part ways with the firm to safeguard its portfolio companies from the fallout of the war.
The buyout firm, which has offices in London and New York, said it would wind down three funds linked to LetterOne, adding the decision had been approved by its board and would be effective on March 25. 

""Such a process is irrevocable and will be conducted in accordance with all legal and regulatory mandates as required,"" Pamplona said in a statement.
It added that the wind down could be executed via the sale of LP interests to third parties as well as through the sale of direct investments.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 closed higher Thursday as chip stocks and the strongest jobless claims report in decades triggered a sea of green on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 rose 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.02%, or 349 points, the Nasdaq rose 1.93%.
Chip stocks (NASDAQ:SOXX) jumped more than 5%, led by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) after the latter's chief executive Jensen Huang said the company would be interesting in using Intel to source its chips.
Some on Wall Street are skeptical, pointing out that Nvidia is unlikely to risk its competitive edge by allowing a rival to produce its chips. 
“[W]e see little likelihood that NVDA would choose to fab prominent products at arguably its most significant competitor's facilities, a choice that would provide Intel with an early look at NVDA's future chip design,” Wedbush said in a note.
The broader tech sector was also helped by ongoing strength in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:FB) after the social media giant confirmed plans to build a hyperscale data center in the north Kansas City area.
Sentiment on risk assets was also supported by data pointing to economic strength as jobless claims fell to their lowest level since 1969.
“It [the labor market] is extremely strong and this data is exactly the sort of evidence that has given the Fed confidence that they can raise rates more quickly to battle inflation,” Jefferies said in a note.
Fed officials have been backing Chairman Jerome Powell's recent remarks hinting at the prospect of the 50-basis-point rate hikes at meetings later this year.  
Durable goods orders, however, fell by a more than expected 2.2% last month, though economists were quick to downplay the weakness, estimating a rebound was likely ahead.
“It seems reasonable, given firms’ sky-high investment spending intentions, to think that March will see a clear rebound,” Pantheon Macroeconomics said.
The backdrop of stronger economic data offset rising geopolitical tensions as the U.S. and its allies look to further isolate Russia as the latter’s ongoing conflict with Ukraine rolls into the fifth week.   
Biden said the U.S. would respond if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, and called on Russia to be booted out of the G20.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), meanwhile, surged almost 5% after the ride-sharing company said it struck a partnership to add New York taxis to its app.

(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp is planning to pick  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) as the lead underwriter on the initial public offering of Arm Ltd that could value the British chip designing company at as much as $60 billion, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The IPO preparations come after SoftBank's deal to sell Arm to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp for $40 billion collapsed last month because of objections from U.S. and European antitrust regulators. SoftBank has said it will now likely list Arm on Nasdaq by March 2023.
SoftBank interviewed investment banks for Arm's IPO in the last few weeks and asked them to commit to providing a credit line as part of their commitments, the sources said. It could not be learned how much Goldman Sachs offered for a credit line.
Bloomberg News reported last month that SoftBank was asking banks for an $8 billion margin loan tied to Arm's IPO stock. 
The sources, who requested anonymity because the preparations are confidential, cautioned that SoftBank's plans were subject to market conditions and it may choose not to proceed with the deal. SoftBank, Arm and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. 
SoftBank took Arm, whose technology powers Apple's iPhone and nearly all other smartphones, private in 2016 for $32 billion.
Arm's net sales surged 40% to $2 billion in the nine months to December amid high demand for chips, SoftBank has said. While this bodes well for the IPO, it may still not make SoftBank whole for the lost Nvidia deal in the short term. This is because a rally in Nvidia shares had led to Arm being worth more than $80 billion at one point under their cash-and-stock merger agreement. 
""We will aim for the biggest IPO ever in semiconductor history,"" SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son told investors last month about Arm's listing. While SoftBank is likely to list Arm in the U.S., it is yet to finalize the venue of the flotation, the sources cautioned.
SoftBank announced a deal to sell Arm to Nvidia in 2020, but the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block it late last year, arguing it would be detrimental to competition in nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips.
The transaction also faced scrutiny from regulators in Britain and the European Union and had yet to receive approval in China.

After the deal was canceled, Arm appointed Rene Haas to replace Simon Segars as chief executive. An industry veteran, Haas joined Arm in 2013 and previously worked for seven years at Nvidia.
Arm licenses its architecture and technology to customers such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd that design chips for devices from mobile phones to computers.

151,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 03:17PM ET</span>","Leaving Russia complicates Renault's turnaround plan, CEO says","By Gilles Guillaume and Nick Carey
PARIS (Reuters) -Renault's Chief Executive Luca de Meo warned on Thursday that the automaker's retreat from Russia creates a ""very complex situation"" for the company, hitting profits and sales as it seeks to accelerate a multi-year turnaround effort.
In an internal video for employees, de Meo said  Renault  (PA:RENA) will make the security of employees a top priority as it weighs options for its Russian operations in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
Renault late Wednesday said it would cut its forecast for operating profit and cash flow and is considering a 2.2 billion euro ($2.42 billion) non-cash writedown to reflect the potential costs of suspending operations in Russia.
Renault is in the early stages of a restructuring its operations to be competitive as it shifts to electric vehicles. In February, the company reported its first annual profit in three years and said it was aiming to improve operating profit margins for this year to 3% or better.
As the global carmaker with the greatest exposure to Russia, Renault has more to lose than many other Western companies. Investors have wiped 40% off its market capitalization over the past month.
Russia's Ministry of Industry and Trade said on Thursday talks were under way to decide the future of the carmaker's Moscow factory with a decision due by the end of next week, potentially offering one of the first examples of what the government intends to do with Western assets
French President Emmanuel Macron said he respected Renault's decision and said companies had the choice to stay in Russia if their sector had not been hit by sanctions. 
Speaking to reporters on Thursday after a G7 and NATO conference, Macron cited a ""reputational risk"" for companies that remain. The French government owns a 15% stake in Renault. Renault's decision followed sharp criticism from Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. 
Renault did not give details on how it would handle a retreat from its second-biggest market, one of more than 400 companies to withdraw.
Renault shares were down as much as 2.6%% in early afternoon trade, but recovered some ground to close down 0.8%. 
Renault's Russian partner Avtovaz, which is controlled by Renault and produces the Lada and Renault car brands, said on Thursday that it would manufacture new models without imported components and would work to rebuild its supply chains. It imports about 20% of its parts and raw materials.
A decade ago, major automakers saw Russia as a promising growth market with potential to be among the world's 10 largest vehicle-buying nations. 
The latest sanctions, and earlier measures imposed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, have ended that dream.
A significant part of Renault's turnaround strategy relied on merging its low-cost brand Dacia and Lada into a single business unit. Lada's vehicles were to be built using Dacia's vehicle platform.
Lada was also part of Renault's cost-cutting plan and its major push into small family cars. A source close to Renault said Dacia will remain profitable even without the economies of scale from Lada brand.
""We think this strategic move will shift the attention of investors into the core operations of Renault, which have been largely restructured over the past years,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note. 

 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said that a Russian exit for Renault would be a better option than a ""wait and see"" approach, even if it comes at a cost for the company.

After the closing bell Wednesday, the company reported a loss per share of 2 cents on revenue of $753.1 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecasted flat earnings on revenue of $752.7 million. Revenue increased 11% compared to prior year.
The company added that ""significant"" inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions continued to impact its operating results during the fourth quarter.
Compared to the prior year, Steelcase orders grew 27 percent in the fourth quarter.
""Our order growth of 27 percent this quarter reflects the investments our customers are making in their workplaces as they increasingly invite their employees back to the office and seek improved engagement, collaboration, focus and connection,"" said Sara Armbruster, Steelcase president and CEO.
At the end of the fourth quarter, the company reported its backlog of customer orders at approximately $787 million. As a result, they expect first quarter fiscal 2023 revenue to be between $680 million to $705 million.
Furthermore, Steelcase expects to report a loss per share of between 15 cents to 20 cents for the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

""Russia’s ongoing unjustified war is a heartbreaking display of brutality and a violation of the fundamental principle of freedom that we share with Ukraine,"" the company said on its website.
It added that the move would not prevent all customers in Russia from using its products as some organisations run installed software that they may be able to maintain on their own.
The withdrawal marks a change in direction as Chief Executive Christian Klein last week in a newspaper interview defended SAP's decision to still provide services to some industries in Russia such as energy, healthcare and trade that have not been directly affected by sanctions.
The move follows an appeal by Ukraine earlier this month for cloud-computing and software giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SAP to cut off Russia to stop Moscow's invasion.
IDC analyst Philip Carter has said that Russian companies have been largely reluctant to rely completely on cloud services for their information technology, potentially limiting the blow from SAP's move.

SAP added on Thursday it was providing its technology to multi-national organizations for humanitarian aid in Ukraine. 
Separately, German telecoms group Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) it was closing its activities in Russia, which mainly amount to a software development centre in Saint Petersburg that is now winding down.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 02:55PM ET</span>","Fidelity's Edward C 'Ned' Johnson 3d, who built fund giant, dies at 91","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) -Edward C. ""Ned"" Johnson 3d, an American billionaire investor and philanthropist who as chairman of Fidelity Investments propelled the family business to a dominant place in finance for decades, died on Wednesday at age 91, the company said. 
Johnson ""died peacefully on March 23, 2022, surrounded by his loving family,"" Fidelity said in a press release. A representative added Johnson died of natural causes.
Johnson led the Boston-based company founded by his father for nearly 40 years before passing the chairman's title to his daughter Abigail Johnson in 2016.
On his watch Fidelity transformed personal investing through the use of new technologies like telephone services and by promoting famous fund managers like Peter Lynch, the former manager of Magellan Fund.
In a LinkedIN post Abigail Johnson wrote that Johnson died at home in Florida and cited her father's love for his family, the stock market and sailing. ""He could be counted on to have the contrarian view on just about anything,"" she wrote.
In later years, Fidelity's actively-managed funds lost ground to cheaper passive products from rivals like BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). Fidelity still ran $4.5 trillion across all its managed investment products as of its latest shareholder letter for 2021, and remained one of Boston's most important companies.
Wary of public attention, Ned Johnson rarely gave speeches and shunned media appearances even as his company came to wield huge influence as a major shareholder in many top U.S. corporations.
""We're just a simple family business,"" he said at a luncheon in Boston in 2007, dismissing yet another interview request.
Yet, he gave away millions of dollars to charities both in his native Massachusetts and worldwide. Friends described Johnson as demanding of others and of himself.
Once, in New York, Johnson made a point of holding an umbrella over guests as he walked them in the pouring rain to a Fidelity reception, recalled Charles Dornbush, a Fidelity executive in the 1990s.
""Here is a guy who is one of the wealthiest people in the world, but there is nobody he looks down at,"" Dornbush said.
A tennis enthusiast and noted collector of antiques and art, Johnson filled Fidelity's stately Boston buildings with Asian prints and sculptures and preached internally the Japanese management philosophy of Kaizen, or continuous improvement.
Edward Crosby ""Ned"" Johnson 3d was born on June 29, 1930 and graduated from Harvard University in 1954. Three years later, he joined as a research analyst at Fidelity, created in 1946 by his father, trust lawyer Edward Johnson II.
The younger Johnson soon made his mark picking stocks and by 1965 was put in charge of Fidelity's then-flagship Magellan fund where his returns beat more famous managers who followed.
He took over Fidelity in 1972, coming up with the idea of letting investors write checks on money market accounts. 
Coupled with heavy investments in telephone call centers and online trading services, the strategy positioned Fidelity as the dominant money manager during the stock market booms of the 1980s and 1990s. 
Fidelity's widely-sold mutual funds like Contrafund and retirement products would later become some of the most popular vehicles for individual investors.
Johnson also had a whimsical side. Once he teased a group of employees after discovering them flying a toy blimp in a Fidelity corridor after hours. ""He was a very down to earth guy,"" said one of those caught, Jackson Loomis.
Despite its scale Johnson kept Fidelity operations under the radar, making hardly any public appearances and creating a board dominated by insiders plus two of his three children, Abigail and son Edward C. Johnson IV. 
Fidelity's private structure gave Johnson the freedom to replace top executives at will and to make unorthodox investments like in the low-margin payroll business, which helped Fidelity gain company retirement accounts. 
But the company also lost ground to rivals BlackRock and Vanguard Group Inc that found more success with low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds.
Johnson's tight grip also meant matters like a gifts scandal involving Fidelity traders in 2003 and 2004 raised questions for Fidelity's leadership. 
Under private ownership Fidelity emerged stronger than most rivals from the financial crisis that began in 2007.

They found that by adding the company's Full-Self Driving option, the delivery time was cut dramatically, and they could remove the $12,000 option just before delivery. In the case of a Model Y, you could get your car seven months quicker than if you ordered without FSD Capability. Tesla has caught on to this loophole and slammed the door shut.
A new update to the Tesla site added a warning to customers attempting to utilize the loophole. When a customer tries to remove the FSD option, an alert lets the customer know that delivery will be delayed if the option is removed.
Many customers will likely be upset with the change. However, it seems reasonable that Tesla would take this route to close the loophole.

156,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 02:20PM ET</span>","KKR still interested in TIM buyout, wants to discuss Open Fiber deal","By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -KKR remains interested in taking over  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) and also wants to discuss the phone group's own plans to combine its fixed line assets with those of state-backed rival Open Fiber, two sources said on Thursday.
KKR submitted a non-binding 10.8 billion euro ($11.9 billion) takeover proposal for TIM in November, having already invested 1.8 billion euros for a 37.5% stake in the group's last-mile fixed-line network last year.
Italy's largest telecoms company left the New York-based fund waiting for nearly four months without an answer before TIM's board agreed earlier in March to engage in talks.
TIM shares rose as much as 12% on Thursday to trade at just under 0.34 euros, as KKR remained in the game and other private equity firms circle with a view to investing in parts of its business under a break-up scenario for the company.
However, the stock remains well short of the 0.505 price per share at which the KKR proposal was pitched.
In a letter responding to questions from TIM on its offer, KKR stuck to a request to carry out a due diligence analysis before deciding on whether to proceed but has narrowed the scope of the information sought, the sources added.
KKR wrote it had ""positive exchanges"" with Italian authorities on its proposal, the people said.
BROADBAND PLAN
While a merger of Open Fiber was not part of KKR's plans for TIM, the fund wants to discuss with the company the antitrust implications of a such a deal and how it can create value for the FiberCop business in which KKR is already an investor, the sources said.
Grappling with fierce competition in its domestic market, debt-laden TIM has been hit by multiple downgrades by major rating agencies this month after reporting a record annual loss and a weak outlook.
In a bid to revamp the beleaguered operator, newly-appointed Chief Executive Pietro Labriola has unveiled plans to split TIM's service operations from its domestic fixed network operations to unlock value.
TIM's largest shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) has slammed the KKR approach as too low and the French media group said there was ""untapped value"" in TIM.
A break-up of TIM could help revive a long-held project to merge TIM's fixed line assets with those of Open Fiber, a move advocated by state lender CDP to avoid a duplication of heavy investment needed to upgrade the country's network.

An Open Fiber merger could provide a 1 euro boost to TIM's shares according to TIM's internal calculations, sources familiar with the matter have said.
CDP owns a stake of nearly 10% in Telecom Italia and 60% in Open Fiber. ($1 = 0.9099 euros)

The analyst said in a note to clients that they attended NetApp's 2022 Investor Day, and while they are confident in NetApp management's strong execution, the investment required for growth will prevent the company from ""realizing operating leverage which, in turn, will limit upside in shares from current levels.""
NetApp shares are down 7% for the year-to-date.
""We see risk/reward balanced,"" said the analyst, adding that the upside to long-term public cloud annual recurring revenue and revenue targets is balanced by risk introduced from additional investments.
Mohan added that the company has the option to scale back investments if growth does not materialize, but the ""resultant slower growth would also limit upside for shares."""

Mercedes-Benz AG, then Daimler AG (DE:MBGn), took over a 15% stake in Kamaz from Daimler Truck in September 2021 with a view to returning it to Daimler Truck after the world's largest truckmaker was spun off from the carmaker in December.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February has complicated the process.
""We are certainly not in any talks with Russian government officials at the moment,"" Daimler Truck Chief Executive Martin Daum said when asked about the future of the relationship to the Russian truckmaker at a news conference on Thursday.
""These shares can't be moved because that needs government approval,"" he said.
Approval is also needed from Russian regulators and Kamaz's other shareholders, the largest of which is Russian state conglomerate Rostec.
Mercedes-Benz did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why it temporarily took on the stake.
A Daimler Truck spokesperson said that while government approval was needed for such transactions in most countries, Daimler Truck was waiting on additional approvals specific to Russia.
The spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company had purposefully put talks on hold, and said it was too soon to say whether it would keep the stake in the long-term.
Both Mercedes-Benz and Daimler Truck froze production in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, including Daimler Truck's cooperation with Kamaz. 

Daimler Truck and Kamaz also have a joint venture, Daimler Kamaz, formed in 2009 producing trucks, buses, and Mercedes-Benz passenger cars, with the latter forming the largest part of its revenue, according to a Daimler Truck prospectus.
Daum said he did not know whether the factory owned by the joint venture was still running. ""This factory needs parts from our side and we don't deliver those parts. Most likely it's not producing at all,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Postal Service said on Thursday it placed an initial $2.98 billion order for 50,000 next-generation delivery vehicles from Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp and will double its initial planned electric vehicle (EV) purchases.
U.S. Postmaster Louis DeJoy said that based on USPS's reform efforts and ""our improving outlook, we have determined that increasing our initial electric vehicle purchase from 5,000 to 10,019 makes good sense from an operational and financial perspective.""
House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn Maloney praised the increase in EV purchases but said ""it is still not enough."" USPS still plans to buy about 80% gasoline-powered models. Maloney said USPS ""must prioritize the acquisition of electric vehicles or it will be stuck with outdated technology that further pollutes our environment for decades.""
Previously, DeJoy committed to buying at least 10% EVs as part of a multibillion-dollar plan to retire 30-year-old delivery vehicles.
USPS in February rejected a bid by the White House and Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider its plans to buy mostly gasoline-powered vehicles and hold a new hearing. 
USPS said it expects the vehicles will begin appearing on carrier routes in late 2023.
In February 2021, the USPS announced an initial $482 million contract for Oshkosh and said it could order up to 165,000 vehicles over 10 years in a deal that could be worth $6 billion or more.
The modern vehicles will replace many older USPS vehicles that lack air bags and other safety equipment as well as air conditioning.
USPS estimates its total costs for buying and operating 75,000 new delivery vehicles over 20 years including fueling and maintenance at $9.3 billion for gasoline-powered vehicles compared with $11.6 billion for electric models.
In 2019, USPS operated 217,000 vehicles that traveled approximately 1.2 billion miles and spent about $706.2 million in maintenance costs for it fleet of 140,000 older delivery vehicles.
Oshkosh said its ""contract allows the flexibility, when funding is provided, to increase the percentage of (electric vehicles) to be produced even after an order is placed.""

U.S. lawmakers have asked Oshkosh if it sought to avoid using union workers by deciding to build the vehicles in South Carolina and asked the Postal Service Office of Inspector General to review USPS's vehicle purchase plan.
USPS said last week its commitment to ""an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our fragile financial condition.""

Uber during its recent investor day in February outlined taxis as a major growth opportunity, calling it a highly fragmented $120 billion industry with 20 million active vehicles - more than five times the number of Uber's own pre-pandemic vehicle base.
The company said it planned to include every taxi on its Uber app by 2025 and last year added 122,000 new taxis to its platform. That represented 3% of its total driver base at a time when it was struggling to retain its usual gig worker drivers amid the pandemic.
The New York City collaboration could add as many as some 13,600 cabs to Uber's app if all of the city's registered cab drivers participate.
Uber's shares rose 6% in early trading, but later pared gains and were up 1.7%.
The deal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, would see Uber work with taxi software companies Creative Mobile Technologies and Curb, which said its goal was to expand the collaboration U.S.-wide.
Passengers will pay roughly the same fare for taxi trips as for Uber X rides, but taxi drivers will be paid according to New York's ride-hail wage standards, which on average are higher than the metered rates, Curb said.
The city has for years been a battleground between Uber and yellow cab drivers, who have long opposed Uber for diminishing their earnings.

Uber said it has already integrated taxis in Spain, Germany, Austria, Turkey, South Korea, Hong Kong and Colombia. Thirty-five percent of users who come to Uber taking a taxi trip go on to use its other mobility products, the company said in February.
""When we look at the next five years, we just don't see a world in which taxis and Uber exist separately. There's too much to gain for both sides,"" Andrew Macdonald, Uber's senior vice president of mobility, said at the time.

The department had asked Judge Amit Mehta to sanction Google, saying the company's ""Communicate with Care"" program was sometimes a ""game"" to shield communications that did not genuinely fall under attorney-client privilege.
In a filing dated Thursday, Google said that ""allegations of sanctionable misconduct are baseless"" and a misreading of a small number of slides used to train employees.
Google also said it was conferring with the government on which emails that are indicated as potentially falling under attorney-client privilege genuinely do. It said it had given the government some of the affected documents.

The news represents a change in direction for the ride-hailing giant, which for years has faced opposition from taxi groups. 
The change in course comes as part of a deal with Creative Mobile and Curb to offer more transportation options. It also helps to ease the company's struggles with driver availability.
""This is a real win for riders who will now have access to thousands of yellow taxis in the Uber app,"" said Guy Peterson, Director of Business Development for Uber.
Uber will roll out a beta for taxi rides in the spring, with a roll out to the general public expected this summer. 
Taxi drivers will be able to see Uber-originated fares on their driver monitors before accepting the ride, something Uber drivers do not see.
“Our partnership with Uber is a natural step forward in the expansion of ground mobility and, as a driver-first company, we will remain committed to our taxi drivers and fleets as we work with Uber to generate enhanced stability and financial wellness for members of the taxi industry,” said Amos Tamam, CEO of Curb.
Uber shares gained 5% Thursday.

(Reuters) - Global tech funds are back in demand and investment inflows are surging as rising inflationary pressures and a selloff in bonds drive investors into a sector perceived as both cheap and resilient.
According to Refinitiv data, tech funds have received inflows worth $2.55 billion since March 16, after outflows worth $6.86 billion in the first two months of this year.

""Tech stocks have not seen a decline in fundamentals, so we see this rally as a rebound from over-cautious investors expecting the Fed would tighten policy too fast,"" said Amanda Agati, chief investment officer at PNC Asset Management Group. 
""Going forward, we have first-quarter earnings season just weeks away ... One of the standouts is expected to be tech, which has been the earnings workhorse during the pandemic,"" she said.
The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF received $640.6 million in net buying in the week ended March 23, while iShares’ Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF and Semiconductor ETF obtained $372.3 million and $260.5 million, respectively, in inflows.

Chinese tech shares, which had lagged their global peers over the past year, also participated in this week's rally, on reports that Chinese regulators have asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms to prepare for more audit disclosures.
The move was perceived as demonstrating Beijing's willingness to make some concessions to resolve a long-running Sino-U.S. audit standoff in which hundreds of billions of U.S. investment dollars in Chinese companies are at stake. 
The Hang Seng SCHK China technology index has risen 23% since March 15, compared with the MSCI World technology index's gain of 7.1%.
Joseph Seeger, senior technology analyst at Nasdaq IR Intelligence, said the higher inflows into the tech funds came as investors divert their money from bond funds into equity funds. 
""Investors are broadly rotating into equities from bonds as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed higher in 10 of the past 13 trading sessions to 2.38%,"" he said. 
""Another catalyst includes generally oversold market conditions in technology, with multiples compressing on average of 40% from the peak.""
Analysts said the tech sector still has strong fundamentals and high cash levels, which would help to reward shareholders with dividends and share buybacks this year. 
According to Refinitiv data, the global tech sectors' cash flow per share stood at $1.26 in 2021, the highest among main sectors.

Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd said this week it has upsized its share buyback programme to $25 billion from $15 billion.
PNC Asset Management's Agati said the small-cap tech stocks have been performing well because much of the sector is in the alternative/clean energy ecosystem. 

Their importance to the energy outlook becomes a significant tailwind, she said, with oil prices above $100 a barrel.
""The global tech rally is well overdue, as the leaders in China tech have been under pressure for over a year at this point. A lot of that hinges on China policymakers following through.""

(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is working with an adviser to sell its gas-producing assets in the Anadarko Basin of North Texas and Western Oklahoma, according to two sources and documents seen by Reuters.
The planned sale, which includes both operated and non-operated leaseholds and royalty interests in the STACK and SCOOP formations of Oklahoma, comes as ConocoPhillips tries to raise cash by offloading non-core land after a buying spree made it the top producer by volume in the top U.S. oilfield.
The Anadarko assets operated by ConocoPhillips could fetch the company around $200 million, while the non-operated assets are likely to be valued at about $100 million, according to the sources.
Over the past 18 months, ConocoPhillips has spent about $23 billion buying properties in the Permian basin. Before spending $9.5 billion to acquire Shell (LON:RDSa)'s acreage in Texas, ConocoPhillips took over rival Concho Resources (NYSE:CXO) for more than $13 billion.
To cover the outlay, ConocoPhillips in September raised its target for asset sales to between $4 billion and $5 billion by the end of next year. The recent sharp rise in energy prices, which boosted asset values, should be a tailwind for the company as it seeks to hit this target.
ConocoPhillips has begun marketing both the operated and non-operated land parcels, which it could sell to a single bidder or separate parties, said the sources, adding that the company could hold onto one or both packages if it does not receive attractive offers.

The sources requested anonymity as the sale talks are confidential. A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company does not comment on ongoing business development or commercial activities.
The U.S. shale producer's operated Anadarko assets consist of 261,200 net acres producing around 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), while the non-operated package covers 17,700 net acres in Oklahoma and has production of 3,000 boepd, according to the marketing document seen by Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters (NYSE:WAT) has asked more than 30 financial services trade groups for information on what steps their members have taken to end business relationships in Russia as pressure escalates on companies to cut ties with Moscow. 
In a letter sent on Thursday to leading industry groups including the American Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Waters requested data on which companies remain engaged in business activities in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine and their reason for doing so.
She also asked the groups to detail their members' processes for complying with Western sanctions. She asked the groups to get the information to the committee within 20 days. 
U.S. Representative Waters, the California Democrat who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, did not indicate what the committee might do with this information.
Financial companies have taken varying approaches in response to Russia’s invasion and Waters' scrutiny is likely to increase pressure on those institutions which have yet to exit. 
""Even though multiple companies have voluntarily divested from Russia, the Committee currently lacks a clear picture of the extent of these divestments,"" she wrote.
""When the full might of the U.S. economy is applied against countries that commit atrocities, we can bring about real and lasting change.""
U.S. payments firms  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) and PayPal Holdings Inc suspended their operations in Russia earlier this month, a move welcomed by the White House.

Several of Wall Street's biggest banks, including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), have committed to winding down business in Russia, although they are also planning on maintaining a limited presence and are holding on to Russian banking licenses, Reuters reported.
Most cryptocurrency exchanges, meanwhile, have resisted calls to cut off Russian users, raising concerns that digital assets could be used to evade Western sanctions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. public company accounting regulator said on Thursday that it continued to engage with Chinese regulators about getting access to their auditors' records, but it remained unclear if the Chinese government would grant the access required by a new U.S. listing law.
The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) said recent media speculation about an imminent deal that would stop hundreds of Chinese companies from being kicked off American stock exchanges was “premature.”
The regulator added that any agreement would only be a “first step” and that the PCAOB would then investigate to ensure that the deal is being followed.
""If an agreement is reached, we will then proceed with our inspection and investigation activities to determine if the agreement operates as intended... (but) an agreement without successful execution will not satisfy U.S. law,"" the audit watchdog said.
Chinese regulators have asked some of the country’s U.S.-listed firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, to prepare for more audit disclosures as Beijing steps up efforts to ensure domestic companies remain listed in New York, Reuters reported n Tuesday
The Financial Times and Bloomberg News also reported this month that China’s securities watchdog is weighing a proposal that would allow U.S. regulators to inspect auditors’ working papers for some companies as soon as this year.
China's regulators have also been considering a proposal to allow their U.S. counterparts to inspect audit working papers of some Chinese firms that do not gather sensitive data.

Chinese companies that list on U.S. stock exchanges must disclose whether they are owned or controlled by a government entity, and provide evidence of their auditing inspections under new SEC rules adopted last year aimed at advancing a process that could lead to more than 200 companies being kicked off U.S. exchanges and could make some Chinese companies less attractive to investors. 
U.S. lawmakers mandated in December 2020 that the watchdog take steps to ensure foreign companies listed in the United States, in particular Chinese companies, comply with U.S. auditing standards after decades of China's reluctance to let overseas regulators inspect local accounting firms due to national security concerns.

The company is short Li-Cycle as the battery recycling SPAC business is a near fatal combination of stock promotion, laughable governance, a broken business hemorrhaging cash, and highly questionable Enron-like accounting.
Among other things, the short seller said LICY has adopted an accounting approach that is vulnerable to abuse, which also allows the management to mark up the value of its receivables on unsold products and runs the gains through its revenue line.
As a result, Blue Orca estimates that around 45% of the company's sales are simply receivables on products that had not been sold and not actual revenues. This is why, according to the short seller, why LICY's CFO and auditor quit earlier this year.
Furthermore, the report goes on to say that Li-Cycle is a governance nightmare.
""Its founder is a serial penny stock promoter recently sanctioned by Canadian authorities and its management team diverted half a million in shareholder money to enrich their entourage with wasteful spending, including tens of thousands of dollars on leather goods purchased from the CEO's family.""
Li-Cycle went public through SPAC with  Peridot Acquisition Corp  last year.

WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Chinese investigators began examining the cockpit voice recorder from a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) jet that plunged into mountainside with 132 people on board as recovery crews searched muddy fields on Thursday for a second black box.
The recording material from the first black box, found on Wednesday, appeared to have survived the impact of Monday's crash in relatively good shape, a Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) official said.
The cockpit voice recorder would provide investigators with details of communications between the flight's three pilots, which is one more than is normally required on board a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 plane. 
The search continued for the flight data recorder.
Debris from the jetliner including engine blades, horizontal tail stabilisers and other wing remnants was concentrated within 30 metres of the main impact point, which was 20 metres deep. 
One 1.3 metre-long fragment suspected to be from the plane was found about 10 km away, prompting a significant expansion of the search area, officials told a news briefing.
No survivors have been found, and experts have said it was all but impossible that anyone could survive such an impact. 
Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming to Guangzhou on the coast when the plane suddenly plunged from cruising altitude at about the time when it should have started its descent to its destination.
The investigation is being led by China but the United States was invited to take part because the plane was designed and manufactured there.
However, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said on Wednesday it had not determined if investigators would travel to China given strict visa and quarantine requirements, and Chinese officials declined to say whether or when NTSB officials would be invited.
""Our work priority is still on search and rescue, and at the same time, carrying out evidence collection and fixation work in the early stage of accident investigation,"" said Zhu Tao, the CAAC's head of aviation safety.
""However, when we enter the accident investigation stage, we will invite relevant parties to participate in the accident investigation according to relevant regulations,"" he said.
SLOW SEARCH
According to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, the plane briefly appeared to pull out of its nosedive, before plunging again into a heavily forested slope in the mountainous Guangxi region.
Authorities said the pilots did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers during the rapid descent. 
It was too early to determine the cause of the crash, which experts say are usually the result of a combination of factors.
""The difficulty now is that we are eager to search for survivors as soon as possible, but our work requires us to search carefully and slowly,"" Huang Shangwu, deputy director of the Combat Training Office of the Guangxi Fire Rescue Corps said at the site.
Search teams used thermal imaging cameras and life detection devices as well as drones.
""The search area is really large, plus the two days of rain make the path very slippery,"" said Zhou, among the more than 1,600 people involved in search operations on Thursday. 
The flight's captain had 6,709 hours flying experience, while the first and second officers had 31,769 hours and 556 hours, respectively, a China Eastern official said on Wednesday. One co-pilot was an observer to build up experience, the airline said, without disclosing the names of the pilots.
Phoenix Weekly magazine cited an aviation expert who identified the captain as Yang Hongda, the son of a former China Eastern captain, and the first officer as Zhang Zhengping, a pilot with 40 years of experience who mentored other pilots.

The Southern Weekly newspaper reported Yang, 32, had a one-year-old daughter, while Zhang, 59, was a veteran pilot with an impeccable safety record and had been expected to retire this year. Another media outlet, Jimu News identified the less experienced second officer as Ni Gongtao, 27.
China Eastern did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the reports.

The market was also underpinned by a government commitment to support stocks, leading a senior U.S. official to dismiss the limited resumption of trading as a ""a charade: a Potemkin market opening"". 
Stocks had not traded on Moscow's bourse since Feb. 25, the day after President Vladimir Putin sent troops into neighbouring Ukraine, prompting Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically and then Russian countermeasures.
The reaction has cut off Russian financial markets from global networks and sent the rouble currency tumbling. Stocks had also plunged immediately after Moscow launched what it calls ""a special military operation"" to disarm and ""denazify"" its southern neighbour.
Restrictions on trade with foreigners and a ban on short selling remained in place on Thursday as the Moscow Exchange cautiously resumed equities trading. On Friday, more securities, including corporate bonds and Eurobonds will be traded, the central bank said.
""We will do everything possible to open all segments of the stock market soon,"" Boris Blokhin, head of Moscow Exchange's stock market department, said.
STELLAR GAINS
The short session saw energy firms make stellar gains, with gas producer Novatek, oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil and gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) up 12%-18.5%. 
Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was trading near $120.6 per barrel on Thursday, having jumped more than 20% from a month ago as worries about supply disruptions from the Ukraine crisis drive up prices. [O/R] 
Shares in mining giant Nornickel also gained 10.2%. 
Novatek and Nornickel pared losses sustained since before Feb. 24 by the session's close. Fertiliser producer Phosagro closed at a record high. 
""Large bids to buy Russian shares have been seen since the market opening,"" BCS Brokerage said in a note, adding that a promise Russia's rainy-day fund will buy shares was also underpinning the market. 
""The overall sentiment is supported by the confidence that the finance ministry will buy stocks,"" BCS said. 
The government said on March 1 that it would use up to 1 trillion roubles ($10.4 billion) from the National Wealth Fund to buy battered Russian stocks, although it was not clear whether any purchases were being made on Thursday.
The finance ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
'POTEMKIN MARKET OPENING'
A senior U.S. official said Moscow's commitment to buy amounted to artificially propping up shares, and called the limited resumption ""a Potemkin market opening"".
""This is not a real market and not a sustainable model - which only underscores Russia's isolation from the global financial system,"" deputy White House national security adviser Daleep Singh said in a statement.
Trading in Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange remains suspended. Prices of some instruments had plunged to almost zero before the bourse halted trading of them in early March.
The Moscow Exchange said 567,000 private investors had accounted for 58.2% of Thursday's trading volume, with 121 professional participants conducting the remainder.
""Today the first step was made in our new reality,"" said Elbek Dalimov, head of equity trading at Aton brokerage, adding that trading orders were limited with non-residents, who hold more than half the free float on the market, sidelined.
""In the morning we saw a huge number of retail investors who on the one hand were closing short positions and on the other were ready to park their roubles in shares, so as to somehow save them from inflation,"" he said.
The benchmark MOEX stock index ended the short trading session 4.4% higher at 2,578.51 points, having earlier reached a day peak of 2,761.17.
The dollar-denominated RTS index fell 9% on the day to 852.64, pressured by the weaker rouble, according to MOEX data that was suspended in the Eikon terminal.
The negative impact of sanctions was clear in some sectors, with shares in Russia's second-largest lender VTB down 5.5%. And with most European airspace closed to Russian planes, flagship carrier Aeroflot sank 16.44%.
Trading apps of major brokerages with leading banks, including Sberbank, VTB and Alfa, reported temporary problems with processing clients' orders following the restart.
ROUBLE FIRMS
The rouble meanwhile extended its recovery, gaining 1.3% to trade at 96.50 against the dollar in Moscow trade by 1502 GMT. 
The currency had hit its strongest level in three weeks at 94.975 on Wednesday after Putin said Russia would start selling its gas to ""unfriendly"" countries in roubles.
Against the euro, the rouble was 2.1% higher at 105.75, pulling further away from an all-time low of 132.4 it hit in Moscow trading earlier in March, but far from levels of around 90 seen before Feb. 24.
Russia resumed trading of OFZ treasury bonds on Monday with the central bank helping to stabilise the market with interventions, the amount of which it has not yet disclosed.

Yields of benchmark 10-year OFZ bonds, which move inversely to their prices, stood at 13.68% after hitting an all-time high of 19.74% on Monday.

Washington has long demanded complete access to the books of U.S.-listed companies, but Beijing, citing national security concerns, bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms. 
The U.S Congress in 2020 passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), which compels the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to delist stocks of companies that do not comply. 
In December, the SEC identified 273 companies that were at risk under the HFCAA, without naming them.
Earlier this month, it named five companies, including KFC operator Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) and biotech firm  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) Ltd, that could face delisting. It added Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) to the list on Wednesday.
""The SEC will gradually move to identify the more systemically significant China based companies listed in the U.S."" said Shaswat K. Das, a lawyer at King & Spalding LLP who previously worked at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board as its primary negotiator with the Chinese regulators on cross-border audit oversight from 2011 to 2015.
China's securities regulator said earlier this month it had made ""positive progress"" with U.S. counterparts on securities supervision, after U.S.-listed Chinese stocks tumbled as the first Chinese firms to be potentially de-listed were named. 
Das, however, cautioned it was too early to tell whether that's going to materialize into anything significant.

According to a Reuters report on Tuesday, citing sources, Chinese regulators have asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, to prepare for more audit disclosures. 
Separately, Yum China has said it may have to delist from the New York stock exchange by 2024 after U.S. authorities said it had failed to provide access to audit documents.

The electric-vehicle maker said at its analyst day on Wednesday it had started manufacturing Tre battery electric vehicle (BEV) at its Coolidge, Arizona facility on March 21 and would deliver 300 to 500 semi-trucks this year. 
The Phoenix, Arizona-based company expects to start production of the Tre BEV truck at its factory in Germany in June 2023.
Several electric vehicle makers including legacy automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors (NYSE:GM) that have entered the segment aim to deliver their first EVs this year as demand heats up, but higher raw material prices and supply chain woes have clouded their timelines.
The Nikola story has increased credibility now as trucks start to roll off the line, said Jeffrey Kauffman, analyst at Vertical Research Partners, adding the company could surprise with new customer orders. 
Nikola expects positive gross margins for its Tre BEV by 2023, which could grow to about 20% after 2025, while in 2022 it expects a negative gross margin of 60% to 75%.
""We got the sense that NKLA has learned a few lessons from other EV companies looking to ramp-up production ... Nikola is in touch with suppliers on a daily basis and is continuously discussing and locking-in pricing as volumes rise,"" DA Davidson analyst Michael Shlisky said.

Traders have a short position on about 27.5% of Nikola's free float, according to estimates from data analytics firm Ortex.
Nikola shares were trading at $10.52. As of Wednesday, the stock had lost at least 35% of its value since the company's founder was charged with defrauding investors in July last year.

Investing.com -- Nikola Corporation (NASDAQ:NKLA) shares jumped Thursday on the news it confirmed the start of production of its electric commercial truck, the Tre, last week.
Production has begun at the company's Coolidge, Arizona factory.
Last month, the company said in its earnings call that production will begin on March 21, and the company looks to have met that goal. 
The company is also developing a fuel-cell-powered electric truck, the Tre BEV, with production for the European market expected to begin at its German factory in June 2023.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Thursday, shrugging off some mixed economic data and apparently reassured by the lack of immediate escalation of geopolitical risks as NATO and the G7 sat down to discuss Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
By 9:50 AM ET (1350 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 128 points or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.4%, resuming their upward trend after a minor correction on Wednesday.
The three indices may have opened more strongly, however, had it not been for a surprisingly soft set of durable goods data, which showed that core durable goods purchases, excluding volatile items such as defense and aerospace goods, fell by 0.3%, their first drop in a year. Headline goods purchases also fell for the first time in five months. The figures may reflect the fading of the pandemic surge in hardware purchases, which was driven by the widespread adoption of remote working. 
There was brighter news from the economy in the shape of weekly jobless claims, where initial claims fell to their lowest since 1969 at 187,000. That was well below forecasts for 212,000, and a continuing reminder of the tightness of the labor market, which is fostering ever-broader rises in wage settlements.
""We expect initial claims to remain low as employers struggling to hire and retain workers keep layoffs to a minimum,"" said Oxford Economics analyst Nancy Vanden Houten in a note to clients. 
The early news from a full day of summits held by NATO, the G7 and EU didn't point to any game-changing escalations, although leaders again warned Russia against using chemical and biological weapons. Ukrainian authorities and unverified footage suggest that the Russian air force used white phosphorus in attacks on Kyiv suburbs on Wednesday night. A White House official also briefed reporters that Ukraine's President Zelensky had not repeated his request for a no-fly zone in a virtual address to the NATO summit. He also stated that the U.S. will supply Ukraine with anti-ship missiles, on the same day that Ukrainian forces appeared to have crippled a large Russian landing ship at the port of Berdyansk.

It's not clear what commission it will charge for yellow cab bookings. 
Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) stock rose 0.9% after the U.S. Postal Service confirmed a $3 billion order for its electric delivery vans, and Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) stock rose 9.4% to its highest in two months after CEO Mark Russell said the electric truck maker will start deliveries in the second quarter. It's yet to register any meaningful revenue from vehicle sales, having struggled to overcome a scandal about its previous management overhyping the company's technical progress.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU lawmakers on Thursday backed lower price caps on wholesale roaming fees paid by telecoms operators to peers in another EU country, extending for a decade a policy that benefits consumers.
The European Parliament and EU countries had reached a political deal in December last year. The next step will be for the latter to give their formal agreement in the coming weeks for the price caps to come into force.
The European Commission scrapped retail roaming charges and introduced price caps on wholesale roaming charges in 2017, saying this would spare consumers from 'bill shock' when they return from their holidays abroad. 
Telecoms providers in southern European countries prefer to keep wholesale price caps as high as possible to benefit from tourists making calls home, while operators in northern Europe, whose citizens tend to holiday abroad, typically argue for lower caps. 
Under the political deal reached last year, the wholesale voice tariff will be capped at 0.022 euro per minute next year and go down to 0.019 euro in 2025 until 2032.
Wholesale rates for text messages will be limited to 0.004 euro per message next year, and at 0.003 in 2025 to 2032.
Data tariffs will be capped at 1.80 euros per gigabyte next year, 1.55 euros in 2024, gradually decreasing to 1 euro in 2027 to 2032.
""By significantly cutting the wholesale caps, we create more fairness and competition on the telecommunications market,"" EU lawmaker Angelika Winzig, who steered the issue through the assembly, said in a statement.

EU lawmakers had originally sought bigger cuts in the price caps than what the European Commission had proposed while EU countries, lobbied by telecoms providers, wanted smaller reductions.
The Parliament said the Commission would look into possibly cutting the costs of intra-EU calls, which are the surcharges for making calls from one EU country to another and now capped at 19 cents, following calls from lawmakers.

""Including the $0.45 - $0.55 gas fee introduced last week,our average price per mile across four Tier 1 markets over this past weekend was $4.22, in line with 4Q21. This is higher than Jan-Feb levels (at $3.54), as price per mile had dropped 16% Q/Q in Jan-Feb (pricing has increased in March, but remains only slightly above historical levels). Across a broader set of Uber and Lyfts across 10 US markets, avg. price per mile was 7% higher today than in 4Q21 (at $4.58 today vs. $4.29 in October 2021),"" analyst Justin Post wrote in a client note.

Net-net, Post remains positive on Uber. The analyst has a $55.00 per share price target on Uber shares.
""Although driver supply concerns have increased with gas price increases, our data indicates that wait times are still better than 2021. We think driver supply risk may be elevated 1Q/2Q, with potential take rate pressure if Uber chooses to offset gas costs by more than the fee amount, given need for drivers to keep up with growing demand. Ultimately, we have noted that mobility in Urban areas is improving in March, and we think industry could pass through higher prices,"" Post said in a client note.

194,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 08:57AM ET</span>","Cheaper petrol, extra cash to help Germans amid soaring energy costs","By Zuzanna Szymanska and Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) -German workers and families will receive extra cash, cheaper petrol and cut-price public transport tickets to help them shoulder soaring power and heating costs after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Germany's ruling coalition said on Thursday.
The deal between Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), the ecological Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), struck after talks that ran deep into the night, should ease tensions over how to respond to ballooning energy costs that are squeezing households and companies.
Finance Minister Christian Lindner said the volume of the planned measures should be similar to a first package of tax relief agreed last month, which he most recently said was worth 16 billion euros ($17.6 billion).
""The coalition believes that we, the people and the economy, must protect ourselves in the short term and for a limited time in the face of these enormous price increases,"" Lindner said.
Under the agreement, workers who pay income tax will receive a one-off energy price allowance of 300 euros ($330) as a supplement to their salaries. In addition, families will receive a one-time bonus of 100 euros per child, which doubles for low-income families.
The price of public transport tickets will be slashed to 9 euros a month for three months. The tax on fuel will be reduced to the European minimum rate for three months, which Lindner said should cut prices at pumps by 30 euro cents for petrol and by 14 cents for diesel.
Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING, said the package was a good start but would not be enough to absorb the economic impact of high prices as it does not include any measures to support companies.
""I'm afraid we won't be able to avoid this topic over the next few weeks,"" he said.

The package agreed by the coalition parties also includes measures to reduce Germany's dependence on Russian gas and to reduce energy consumption, for instance by boosting funding for the construction of energy-efficient buildings.
The costs of the package of measures will be covered in a supplementary budget for this year to be unveiled next month, which will also include funding for humanitarian assistance to Ukrainian refugees and upgrading the German armed forces.

LONDON (Reuters) -The Bank of England said on Thursday that it might not go ahead with plans announced in December to raise banks' capital requirements in the coming quarter, given Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The BoE said major British lenders' capital and liquidity position remained strong, but economic uncertainty meant it might not be appropriate to raise cyclical capital requirements that are linked to economic recovery.
""Global financial markets, particularly for commodities, have been volatile and uncertainty over the economic outlook has increased significantly,"" the BoE said in a quarterly report from its Financial Policy Committee.
Margin calls on commodity derivatives had risen to an all-time high, but served as a ""critical safeguard"" for financial stability, the BoE said.
The BoE had said in December that it intended to raise banks' counter-cyclical capital buffer (CCyB) - its main tool to smooth lending over the course of the credit cycle - to 2% from 1% in the in the second quarter of 2022, with full effect a year later.
While domestic risks had not changed since then, the global environment had, the BoE said.
""Given this uncertainty, the Committee will continue to monitor the situation closely and stands ready to vary the UK CCyB rate in either direction,"" the FPC said.
The direct exposures of UK banks to Russia amount to 1% of their core capital at the end of 2021, the FPC said.
Deciding the CCyB rate would be easier once the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) published new economic forecasts in May, the FPC added.
The BoE also said it would delay an annual stress test of banks' financial health, which had been suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, until later in 2022.

Policymakers saw little risk to financial stability from a sharp rise in house prices, and expected borrowers to continue to be able to repay mortgages despite a sharp rise in the cost of living.
Poorer households were likely to struggle more, however.

It was the largest fine Ireland has ever handed down to a fund service provider. With just over 1.13 trillion euros in assets under administration, BNY Mellon Ireland is the second largest fund administrator in the country, which is a hub for the global funds industry.
Like other operators, BNY Mellon Fund Services (Ireland) provides fund administration or ""back office"" services on behalf of fund managers and investment funds in Ireland and around the world.
The regulator said the breaches arose due to BNY Mellon Ireland's failure to comply with its regulatory obligations and have an adequate governance framework in place for these outsourcing activities that are integral to its operating model.
This undermined its ability to effectively identify and manage the risks associated with its outsourcing arrangements and created unnecessary potential risks to its clients, investors and the financial markets, the central bank said.
""The investigation found systemic weakness across its entire outsourcing framework. Despite intervention by the Central Bank over a number of years, BNY DAC (BNY Mellon Ireland) repeatedly failed to address these deficiencies,"" Central Bank Director of Enforcement Seana Cunningham said in a statement
BNY Mellon Ireland, whose parent group is the world's largest custodian bank, admitted to the 16 breaches, the first of which was identified in 2014, and has taken the necessary steps to rectify the deficiencies, the central bank said.

Renault, the biggest player in the Russian auto market, said on Wednesday it stopped production at the plant and would assess its options on its majority stake in Avtovaz, Russia's No. 1 carmaker following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The government's comments about the future of the factory come after the Kremlin suggested it could nationalise assets of foreign firms that left the country.

Speaking at an analysts call on 2021 results, Fincantieri CFO Giuseppe Dado said that the group's naval division was poised to grow in the short term thanks to the backlog of orders already secured.
In the long-term the naval business, which makes military vessels, could rise to up to 40% of its shipbuilding segment, from a current figure of 31%, Dado said. 
In 2021 the shipbuilding segment reported a 27% rise in sales to 5.9 billion euros, the group said late on Wednesday, adding that total revenue reached 6.7 billion euros.
Fincantieri did not give specific guidance on 2022 results citing the uncertainty stemming from both geo-political tensions and raw materials and energy prices inflation.
The group's executives however said that the core profit margin, which is an indicator of profitability, would remain high, after recovering to 7.4% last year. 
Last year Fincantieri made a non-binding offer to buy Leonardo's OTO Melara and Wass units, which make cannons and torpedoes.

Semiconductor supply will weigh on results particularly in the first quarter, Daum said, with the company sitting on high inventories of unfinished vehicles as it waits for semiconductors to arrive.
""When suppliers suddenly cut [their offer] by half nearly overnight, that is an unbearable situation,"" Daum said. ""We've had to fly in parts by helicopter, which in my entire long career in trucking was unheard of.""
Asked about its cooperation with Russian truckmaker Kamaz, which was frozen in late February, Daum said it was not supplying components to Kamaz but had not yet had any contact with Russian officials about the next steps.
Mercedes-Benz AG, which Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck split off from in December, holds a 15% stake in the Russian firm and two Daimler Truck executives sit on its board, though both stepped back until further notice in early March.
""We have to reassess,"" Daum said. ""We are certainly not in talks with any Russian government officials at the moment.""
The truckmaker said it expects at least a 14% increase in revenue this year and for its return on sales to rise to 7-9% from 6.1% last year.

Returns were strongest in North America in 2021 at 9.2% but the fourth quarter was weaker in part due to the impact of two recalls in December that cost the firm $1 million, Goetz said.

PARIS (Reuters) -Renault SA, the Western carmaker most exposed to the Russian market, said on Wednesday it would suspend operations at its plant in Moscow while it assesses options on its majority stake in Avtovaz, the country's No. 1 carmaker. 
The move came amid mounting pressure over the French company's continued presence in Russia since the country invaded Ukraine. Ukraine's foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has called for a global boycott of  Renault  (PA:RENA). 
""Renault Group reminds that it already implements the necessary measures to comply with international sanctions,"" the company said in Wednesday's statement, its first on the issue since the start of the war. The statement made no mention of the crisis in Ukraine. 
The French carmaker on Wednesday revised its operating group margin to around 3% from at or above 4% in 2022 and adjusted its automotive cash flow outlook to ""positive"" from a previous estimate of 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion) or above. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier accused Renault of financing the war and said Renault, among other French companies, must stop ""financing the murder of children and women, of rape.""
Kuleba wrote in a tweet on Wednesday, ""I welcome @renaultgroup's statement on cessation of industrial activities in Russia. Responsible move against the backdrop of Russia’s ongoing barbaric aggression against Ukraine.""
Renault derives 8% of its core earnings from Russia, according to Citibank, mainly through its 69% stake in Avtovaz, which is behind the Lada car brand.
According to two sources close to the matter, Renault's board of directors considered different scenarios but decided for the time being to maintain a presence in Russia.
A decade ago, automakers saw Russia as a promising growth market with the potential to be among the ten largest vehicle-buying nations in the world. The latest sanctions, and earlier measures imposed after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea, have derailed those prospects.
The French government has said repeatedly it was up to French companies to decide on the future of their operations in Russia, as long as they comply with international sanctions.
After resuming Russian production earlier this month, the company announced a further partial shutdown at its Togliatti and Izhevsk sites this week, citing shortages of electronic components. 
Its Russian operations last year accounted for almost 20% of total group volume, but Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard said on March 10, two weeks in to the war, that the crisis was unlikely to threaten the French carmaker's recovery.
Renault said on Wednesday it will quantify the value of assets affected by the decision on the Moscow plant when it releases half-year results. Last year those assets stood at 2.2 billion euros ($2.42 billion), the company said.
Other companies with operations in Russia have suspended or scaled back operations in the face of Western sanctions, but still maintained some ties to their business in the country. These companies are feeling pressure to further shut down. 
U.S. automaker Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co said on March 1 it would suspend shipments of components and other support for a van-making venture 51% owned by Russian manufacturer Sollers. Ford has not said what it will do with its 49% stake in that operation.
French food group Danone said on Wednesday it would continue local production in Russia of essential dairy and infant nutrition products, but had cut other ties with the country over its war in Ukraine.
Swiss rival Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) said it would halt the sale of a wide range of brands in Russia, including several nonessential products such as KitKat snacks and Nesquik chocolate mix. It had already halted nonessential imports and exports to Russia.

Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.

Odeon Capital's veteran bank analyst Dick Bove highlighted that if the Fed moves ahead with aggressive rate hikes, interest payments by the United States could conceivably reach the annual level of $620 billion by year-end 2022 nearly double 2021 levels. It could further balloon to $900 million by 2024. The money for these payments would have to be borrowed in the open market. Additionally, the equity of the Federal Reserve, to the degree it exists, would be wiped out.
""The numbers are concerning,"" Bove commented. ""They imply that the Federal Reserve might not be able to pursue a course as rigorous as the one implied.""
As Germany asks itself how it could ever let itself get into its precarious position related to reliance on Russian oil, the Fed should be asking itself a similar question: how it could allow the nation to spin out of control monetarily.
Given the above risks, Bove said the Fed might not be able to institute a significant rate hike program. If that is the case, inflation will remain a severe problem.

Traeger reported Q4 adjusted EPS of 3c, compared to the expected loss per share of 4.9c. Revenue in the fourth quarter came in at $174.9 million, topping the consensus estimates of $156.6 million.
The gross margin was 37.4% in the period, compared to the analyst consensus of 35.1%. Traeger reported Q4 adjusted EBITDA of $13.8 million, topping the consensus projection of $9.08 million.

""Even against lowered market expectations (COOK shares are now down over 50% from the IPO price), FY22 guidance was meaningfully below our prior view.

Nikola shares are up 9% in the pre-open Thursday on this update.
Mark Russell, CEO of  Nikola Corp  . said the company is expected to start in the second quarter of the year, with the truckmaker planning to deliver 300 to 500 Tre BEV semi-trucks in 2022.
The company hasnt reported any revenue from truck sales yet.
The EV company held its Analyst Day this week. JPMorgan analyst Bill Peterson visited Nikolas factory and was allowed to test drive the Tre BEV truck and Tre FCEV truck.
Peterson said he gained a favorable impression after the ride and was impressed with the trucks performance and manufacturing readiness.
Peterson also noted an increasing customer interest in BEV and FCEV trucks and added Nikolas hydrogen ecosystem continues to grow.
RBC analyst Joseph Spak also took part in the tour and said he believes Nikola is making rapid progress, but its still very early days and execution and capital risk present.
Nikola told analysts that the Coolidge facility's progress is on track. The EV company is still looking to start US deliveries in Q2 2022 and Europe is scheduled for Q3. The guidance remains 300-500 trucks for this year.
""Hydrogen infrastructure remains a key component of the long-term strategy to support Tre FCEV and hydrogen fuel adoption. NKLA now looking to take a more asset-light, capital-efficient approach targeting strategic and financial partnerships through SPVs on the production and dispensing segments but will look to maintain 100% control of the distribution segment to ensure that customers have fuel where they need it.

The announcement marks a significant privilege for Spotify as major mobile app stores rarely enable third-party billing systems inside apps.
Spotify stock price surged roughly 3.5% on the news.
In the past, two of the biggest mobile app stores including Google Play and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store did not allow developers to directly charge their customers for their services but rather were required to solicit customers credit cards through Googles system, which charges from 15% to 30% of total sales.
However, that may now change. Google said allowing Spotify to provide its own billing is a pilot but did not offer any details about when or in which countries the feature be available to other app makers. The tech giant said it will allow only a small number of developers to provide their own billing for now.
This pilot will allow a small number of participating developers to offer an additional billing option next to Google Plays billing system and is designed to help us explore ways to offer this choice to users, while maintaining our ability to invest in the ecosystem, Google wrote in a blog post.
Google will still charge Spotify a fee for processing the payments on its own, and said it plans to expand the policy it uses in South Korea where it charges an 11% fee on subscription purchases handled through a third-party billing system, demanded by the new South Korean legislation.

LONDON (Reuters) -Britain sanctioned another wave of Russia's banks, critical industries and a host of members of its elite on Thursday, including Gazprombank, Alfa Bank, and a woman they said was the stepdaughter of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. 
The sanctions on 59 Russian and six Belarusian entities and individuals included state-run shipping firm Sovcomflot, private military contractor Wagner Group and Alrosa, the world's largest diamond producer with an estimated market value of $6.61 billion.
Britain and other Western nations are using sanctions to cripple the Russian economy and punish President Vladimir Putin for invading Ukraine, seeking to press him to abandon what he calls a special military operation to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine.
Kyiv and its allies call it a baseless pretext to invade a democratic nation of 44 million people.
Britain also targeted Polina Kovaleva, who it described as the stepdaughter of Russia's Lavrov. The government said she reportedly owns a 4 million pound property in London, with property records showing she lives in the Kensington district, famous for its parks, upmarket shops and museums. 
She purchased it in 2016 without a mortgage, the records show.
Another individual to be targeted is German Gref, the CEO of Russia's largest bank Sberbank. 
""Putin should be under no illusions – we are united with our allies and will keep tightening the screw on the Russian economy to help ensure he fails in Ukraine,"" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said. ""There will be no let-up"".
Gazprombank is one of the main channels for payments for Russian oil and gas. Alfa-Bank is one of Russia's top private lenders, controlled by Mikhail Fridman, who was sanctioned by Britain earlier in the month, and his partners.
They and four other banks were subject to asset freezes which lock them out of any resources held in Britain and prevent British firms from doing business with them.
The Sovcomflot designation could complicate its insurance cover, and will likely have a broader industry impact - its British arm facilitates the chartering of its crude oil tankers, product carriers, chemical tankers and liquefied gas carriers, SCF's website said.
The firm was among the Russian entities the U.S. Treasury restricted last month from raising capital in U.S. markets.
Most of the new sanctions were introduced under British laws recently rushed through parliament allowing Britain to mirror measures put in place by allies like the European Union and United States.
The sanctions also targeted Russian Railways and defence company Kronshtadt, the main producer of Russian drones.
Britain said the total asset value of the banks that have been sanctioned since the invasion of Ukraine was 500 billion pounds ($658.65 billion) and the net worth of the oligarchs and family members was more than 150 billion pounds. 

Among the other individuals sanctioned were oil tycoon Evgeny Shvidler and founder of Tinkoff bank Oleg Tinkov.

SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A plan by UBS and China Life Insurance Group to set up an asset management joint venture in China faces uncertainty as talks have stalled due to a corruption investigation at the insurer and curbs set on the scope of the business, two sources said. 
China Life's asset management arm and the Swiss bank began negotiations in late 2020 to jointly form a so-called ""wealth management company"" to manage money for mainly retail investors, Reuters reported in December, citing sources.
The discussions have now stalled, though they have not been formally called off, said the sources, who had knowledge of the matter but declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The stalling of the talks underscores challenges for western financial firms looking to expand and grab a bigger share of China's 100 trillion yuan ($15.70 trillion) asset management sector, which has opened up for bigger foreign participation. 
The talks have cooled as the then Chairman of China Life Insurance Group, Wang Bin, was put under investigation by the country's corruption watchdog in January.
The development has resulted in a review of planned deals initiated under Wang's watch, said the sources.
The joint venture talks faded also because the scope of business for such asset management ventures was overestimated, said the sources.
UBS had originally hoped that the planned venture would be able to sell wealth management products (WMPs) via China Life's army of insurance agents - an idea that was later proven to be misplaced under new rules for selling of such products published last year.
The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) published rules in 2021 that stipulate only banks and other deposit-taking financial institutions are allowed to distribute WMPs.
UBS declined to comment, while a spokesperson for China Life Insurance Co Ltd, the listed arm of China Life Insurance Group, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
""We are still pushing, but the progress is behind our expectations,"" one of the sources told Reuters, referring to the status of joint venture discussions.
UBS was looking to hold a majority stake in the venture, permitted by China in such partnerships since 2019.
China in 2018 allowed banks and other eligible financial institutions to set up so-called ""wealth management companies"" - in essence asset management firms - as part of a campaign to squeeze risky shadow banking.

An ensuing push by Beijing to lure foreign investors into the space led to a flurry of deals by global asset managers, including BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), Amundi,  Schroders  (LON:SDR), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), to form majority-owned ventures with Chinese lenders.

LONDON (Reuters) -Lloyd's of London faces major claims this year related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but this will not lead to solvency issues, the commercial insurance market said on Thursday.
Lloyd's is asking its member syndicates to give details of their exposure to the conflict, Chairman Bruce Carnegie-Brown told Reuters, adding it was too soon to estimate the size of the loss.
Lloyd's has around 100 members that underwrite complex risks such as planes, ships and oil rigs.
The aviation insurance market is seen as particularly exposed to the impact of what Russia has described as a ""special military operation"" and of the West's subsequent sanctions.
Global leasing companies face an imminent sanctions deadline for the repossession of more than 400 jets worth almost $10 billion from Russian airlines. Analysts say legal wrangling between airlines, lessors and insurers could last a decade.
Lloyd's said business underwritten in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus accounted for less than 1% of the market's total business.
""In terms of our direct exposures, they're quite low. So this is much more about second order impacts, of which aviation will clearly be one and will end up being significant,"" Carnegie-Brown said.
Some insurance policies kick in as a result of a war, while others do not cover war, making exposures hard to calculate, he said. Policyholders have notified insurers of likely claims, but have yet to file them, he added.
The COVID-19 pandemic hit Lloyd's hard in 2020, but the market recovered last year after it raised premium rates and excluded the virus from policies.
It posted a 2021 pre-tax profit of 2.3 billion pounds ($3.04 billion), following a 900 million-pound loss in 2020.

HYDERABAD, India (Reuters) -Airbus expects Indian airlines to order 2,210 planes over the next 20 years, up from a previous forecast of 1,900, it said on Thursday, citing growth in the country's aviation sector.
With low-cost carriers making up the bulk of the Indian market, Airbus expects airlines will need 1,770 narrowbody planes to grow their fleets and replace old planes, with the remainder being widebody planes, Brent McBratney, head of airline marketing for India and South Asia, said at an air show. 
India's domestic and international air travel market is expected to grow 6.2% per year over the next 20 years, outpacing average global growth of about 3.9%, McBratney said.
While a proliferation of low-cost carriers has spurred demand for narrowbody planes in India, McBratney also expects growth in long-haul travel, which he said was a largely untapped market for Indian carriers.
Domestic air travel in India is recovering from the pandemic, helping airlines such as IndiGo, which is Airbus' biggest customer for its A320 narrowbody planes, and Vistara, a joint venture between Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) and Tata Sons, to boost capacity and utilisation levels. 

But as crude prices hit record highs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the cost of jet fuel has risen, which could lead to higher ticket prices and temper demand. 
However, Airbus expects domestic air travel in India to reach pre-COVID levels by mid-2022, while international travel traffic is expected to recover by next year. Airbus said in November it expected a market total of 39,020 jetliner deliveries over the next 20 years, fractionally lower than the 39,213 it forecast two years earlier.

222,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 04:19AM ET</span>","Europe Stocks Open Mostly Higher Ahead of NATO, EU Summits; Russia Reopens","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- European stock markets opened mixed on Thursday ahead of a key day for diplomacy aimed at halting Russia's war in Ukraine.
Western leaders will attempt to raise the pressure on Russia's Vladimir Putin to end the war at three different summits in Brussels: NATO leaders will meet first, then the G7, then the European Union. All three will be attended by U.S. President Joe Biden, who will be trying to convince Germany and others of the need to close the sanctions loopholes that still allow purchases of Russian oil and gas. Progress is likely to be tough, given that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated his opposition to an immediate stop to Russian energy purchases only on Wednesday.
The summits come a day after Putin said Russia will demand that 'hostile' countries pay for their energy supplies in rubles, rather than dollars or euros, an announcement that drove the ruble to its highest against the dollar since Russian tanks crossed the border a month ago. The move would effectively force the West to transact with the Russian central bank, whose foreign currency reserves have already been frozen by U.S., EU, U.K., and Japanese authorities.
By 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was up 0.1%, while euro was down 0.1% against the dollar at $1.0989. The best performer among major markets was France's CAC 40 with a 0.2% gain, while Sweden's OMX 30 lagged with a drop of 0.4%.
Russian assets, by contrast, were more buoyant. The ruble traded at only 95 to the dollar, a 50% gain from its low point in the immediate aftermath of the sanctions. The ruble-based MOEX index rose 9.6%, amid reports that Russia's sovereign wealth fund was actively buying to support prices. The central bank has banned short-selling and not all Russian equities have resumed trading.
Further west, however, there was evidence of continued disruption to economic activity in what has become an important market for many European companies. French automaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) issued a profit warning and said it would suspend production of its own brand cars in Russia and would consider walking away from its controlling 68% stake in AvtoVAZ, Russia's largest carmaker. Renault stock, which has already lost 25% in the month since the invasion, fell another 1.8%. By the same token, food and drink giant Nestle said it would stop selling its more discretionary products such as KitKat and Nespresso, but said it will continue to sell products such as baby food. Nestle stock fell 0.2%.
In the U.K., the FTSE 100 was largely flat, while sterling also edged down against the dollar, a day after the government announced cuts to income tax and fuel duty to support consumer purchasing power. Analysts observed that Treasury Chief Rishi Sunak had not gone as far as he might have done, given the unexpected improvement in U.K. public finances in recent months as the pandemic has receded.
Among notable movers, fashion retailer  Next  (LON:NXT) fell 3.1% after cutting its profit guidance for the current fiscal year by 10%."

226,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 03:16AM ET</span>",Toshiba faces unclear future after shareholders knock back two rival proposals,"By Makiko Yamazaki and Rocky Swift
TOKYO (Reuters) -Toshiba Corp shareholders on Thursday voted down competing proposals - one presented by management and the other backed by activist shareholders, leaving the future direction of the embattled Japanese conglomerate uncertain.
Management's plan to spin off Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY)'s devices unit and the separate call to seek buyout offers had both failed to gain the required 50% of the vote.
The untidy outcome ensures there will be no immediate end to a four-year scandal-filled battle between management and foreign activist hedge funds, while underscoring deep divisions among Toshiba shareholders.
Opposition to Toshiba's plans to break up the company had been widespread and included proxy advisory firms, and its failure comes as no surprise. But the outlook for Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners' proposal that Toshiba solicit private equity buyout offers or a minority investment had been less clear cut.
Although 3D and Toshiba's other top two shareholders had supported the quest for a buyout offer, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had advised against it, saying the proposal ""appears overly prescriptive and premature.""
Where Toshiba management goes from now is very much an open question though the company is expected to revise its restructuring plan and some analysts said they expect sales of some assets such as Toshiba Tec, which makes point-of-sale systems and copiers. 
Speaking at the end of the extraordinary general meeting, Toshiba's new CEO Taro Shimada, a former Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) executive, only said the company ""would consider various strategic options"".
Toshiba's shares ended down 0.5% after the results.
ACTIVISTS TO FIGHT ON
For some observers, the results represented a major setback for the activist hedge funds.
""It looks terrible for the activists primarily because they don't have a big enough stake to dictate the voting and are unwilling to commit further capital,"" said David Baran, co-founder of fund management firm Symphony Financial Partners.
""They're trapped. They thought they could get away with their U.S.-style tactics because it made sense to them. Well, how's that working out?"" he added.
But the push for a buyout, which has the potential to yield solid returns for hedge funds that bought into the crisis-ridden conglomerate, is far from over.
Activist shareholders plan to fight on to force the company to restart talks with private equity firms regardless of the vote outcome, sources familiar with the matter have previously told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Some shareholders have also said they expect one or two top investors to nominate their own representatives for the board at Toshiba's annual shareholders meeting in June to make the company solicit private equity buyout offers.
During the five-month strategic review conducted last year, Toshiba held discussions with private equity firms but decided not to entertain potential offers.
It also walked away from advanced talks for a minority stake from Canada's Brookfield Asset Management, sources have said, adding that the private equity firms Toshiba held talks with included KKR & Co (NYSE:KKR) Inc and Bain Capital.
Toshiba has argued that the potential buyout offers were insufficiently compelling.
The make-up of Toshiba's board will also be a key focal point amid criticism that it conducted a flawed strategic review which led to the plans to break up the company.
Paul Brough, the chair of the five-member strategic review committee, has indicated he would reconsider his position if the breakup plan was voted down, ISS said in a report.

Toshiba's management has been under pressure from activist funds since it sold 600 billion yen ($5 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017.
Acrimony between the two sides hit several boiling points in the past two years. Last June a shareholder-commissioned probe found Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry - which sees the conglomerate as a strategic asset due to its nuclear reactor and defence technology - to block overseas investors from gaining influence at its 2020 shareholder meeting.

Big Swiss banks must demonstrate how they would right themselves in the event of an emergency, or how they can be restructured or liquidated without obstacles while maintaining their systemically important functions in Switzerland.
""FINMA sees further progress in the global resolvability of the large Swiss banks Credit Suisse and UBS,"" the watchdog said in a statement. ""They significantly reduced obstacles to the implementation of the resolution strategy."" 
FINMA also approved the recovery plans of both large banks again. 
""FINMA also continues to view the Swiss emergency plans of Credit Suisse and UBS as effective,"" it said.
Resolvability means creating the conditions for successfully restructuring a systemically important bank in a crisis, or allowing it to exit the market by way of bankruptcy, without jeopardising financial stability.
This is part of Switzerland's so-called Too Big to Fail rules, aimed at reducing risks to the financial system and avoiding the need for taxpayer-funded bailouts.

FINMA said the emergency plans of the other domestically important banks - PostFinance, Raiffeisen and Zuercher Kantonbank were still not ready.
""None of the banks has reserved sufficient loss-absorbing funds for them to be recapitalised and their operations continued in a crisis,"" FINMA said.

229,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 24, 2022 01:36AM ET</span>",Clients plead with top custodian banks to stay in Russia,"By Sinead Cruise, Matt Scuffham and Megan Davies
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Global banks including  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) face pressure to commit to remaining as custodian banks in Russia, as rivals and funds fret they may lose services critical to future investment in the country. 
Traders, bankers and executives from three other financial institutions told Reuters they were seeking or had sought reassurances on behalf of clients on each bank's long-term plans for these businesses, which clear, settle and safeguard billions of dollars of Russian holdings.
Custodian banks have departments that look after assets for clients in return for fees.
One London-based banking source, speaking anonymously to respect confidentiality of their large global fund client, said they were in weekly contact with senior executives at Citibank Moscow on the status of their custodian business.
The source said their client was waiting to trade Russian equities when the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) reopens, but they needed the reassurance of having a Western custodian in place.
According to the source, the Citigroup executives said they would serve clients for as long as sanctions permitted.
A source with knowledge of Citi said that major U.S. and international businesses in Moscow use that bank and cutting those customers off would damage client relations. Other bankers said it is crucial to the industry that Citi, a key player, keep operating in Moscow. 
Citigroup declined to comment. 
A second banker, based in New York, said he had sought assurances from SocGen that they would ""stay on the ground"" so that his bank could meet custody obligations to clients. Executives at SocGen provided assurances that they would, at least in the near term, the source said.
Citigroup and SocGen, the French parent of Rosbank, have already announced plans to dramatically pare operations in Moscow as part of a sweeping programme of Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically following its invasion of Ukraine. 
Both banks have said they will aid their clients with the complex tasks of unwinding or reducing exposures to Russia, and said withdrawals will take time to execute. 
But neither has made a public statement on the long-term status of their custodian services, leaving some clients nervous for the future.
In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for SocGen said the group was ""conducting its business in Russia with the utmost caution and selectivity, while supporting its historical clients.""
SocGen ""is rigorously complying with all applicable laws and regulations and is diligently implementing the necessary measures to strictly enforce international sanctions as soon as they are made public.""
The bank declined to comment specifically on its custody business in Russia.
JPMorgan Chase & Co also provides similar custody services from its Moscow outpost. The bank has received queries from clients seeking assurances that custody services will continue to be provided, according to a source familiar with the matter. It has previously said it will continue acting as a custodian to its clients.
Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp has also said it will continue to provide custodian services in Russia. 
SHUT OUT
If banks decide to mothball their custody services in Moscow, many Western investors already holding Russian stocks or bonds would have to look elsewhere for a bank to hold those assets, while others keen to exploit a financial market or economic rally when sanctions are lifted could find it harder to pursue those plans.
SocGen, France's third-largest bank, warned stakeholders on March 3 that it could be stripped of its property rights to its business in Russia in a ""potential extreme scenario.""
Citi, meanwhile, originally said it would operate its Russian business on a more ""limited basis"" in the wake of the war, which President Vladimir Putin has called ""a special military operation."" 
But by March 14, it said it would accelerate and expand the scope of that retreat by giving up its institutional and wealth management clients in Russia.
Besides transaction services, many of the Moscow-based custody teams are providing add-ons like language translation of central bank documents that are also highly valued by Western clients, the source said.
Russia's central bank said separately on Wednesday that some stock market trading would resume on Thursday, with 33 securities set to be traded on the Moscow Exchange for a limited period of time and with short selling banned. 
The challenge for banks in meeting obligations to clients in Russia is getting tougher, and might become even more daunting if sanctions are tightened, with the one-month anniversary of the invasion falling this week.
Russia laid down strict new rules for foreigners seeking permits to buy and sell Russian assets ranging from securities to real estate.
Another New York-based banker described the business of ensuring clients are in compliance with sanctions in relation to securities holdings as a ""logistical nightmare"" and said his firm had hired 20 new compliance staff in recent weeks.

Global companies, banks and investors have so far disclosed nearly $135 billion in exposure to Russia, company statements show.
U.S. asset managers including Vanguard and Capital Group Companies Inc, which manages the American Funds franchise popular among millions of mom and pop retirement savers, have also disclosed large exposures topping billions of dollars, according to the most recent portfolio information available.

Investing.com – Koomin Bank sold Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. Ltd. (KS:005930) shares that were worth around $1.1 billion earlier in the day, according to a term sheet that was seen by Reuters.
The term sheet showed that about 19.9 million shares priced at KRW68,800 won per share were put on the block. Kookmin, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) acted as bookrunners for the sale.
Samsung Electronics' South Korean shares rose 0.85% to KRW69,900 ($57.44) by 1:17 AM ET (5:17 AM GMT), after falling 1% to KRW 69,800 won in early Asian trading. The company’s shares recorded a 0.9% fall in the wider market.
Samsung Electronics did not comment on the sale, but analysts said that the move had been widely expected.
The shares also match the amount that Ra-hee Hong, mother of Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee agreed to keep in trust with Kookmin Bank in October 2021, a Samsung Electronics filing showed. The filing also showed that the trust agreement period was due to end by Apr. 25, 2022.
Hong is also the wife of deceased Samsung patriarch Kun-hee Lee. Since the elder Lee’s death in 2020, the family that owns Samsung has used its shares in affiliated companies to pay part of more than $10 billion in inheritance tax, people with direct knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters.
South Korea’s tax code allows payment of inheritance tax in installments, with an initial one-sixth of the total to be paid first. The remainder must be over five years with an annual interest rate. Even in installments, KRW 2 trillion, or $1.64 billion, will be due annually, according to analysts."

SEOUL (Reuters) -Samsung Electronics shares worth about $1.1 billion were sold in a block deal on Thursday, according to a document, which some analysts attributed to the Samsung (KS:005930) conglomerate's controlling family raising cash to meet a big tax bill.
About 19.9 million Samsung shares were sold by Kookmin Bank at 68,800 won per share, a discount of 2.4% to Wednesday's closing price of 70,500 won, a term sheet of the deal seen by Reuters showed.
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) did not have a comment on the sale.
But the shares on sale matched the amount that Hong Ra-hee, mother of Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee and wife of deceased Samsung patriarch Lee Kun-hee, agreed to keep in trust with Kookmin Bank in October, according to a Samsung Electronics filing that month.
The trust agreement period was due to end by April 25, the filing showed.
Since patriarch Lee died in 2020, Samsung's controlling family decided to use shares in affiliated companies to pay part of more than $10 billion in inheritance tax, people with direct knowledge of the matter previously told Reuters.
The tax code allows payment in instalments, with one-sixth of the total to be paid first, and the remainder over five years with an annual interest rate. Even in instalments, analysts expect over 2 trillion won ($1.64 billion) to be due annually.
""The owner family is likely to sell additional shares to secure funds for inheritance tax,"" said Choi Kwan-soon, an analyst at SK Securities. Samsung Electronics' share price was down 1% at 69,900 won in early afternoon trade, versus a 0.5% fall in the wider market.

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Kookmin were bookrunners for the sale.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Union workers at  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX)'s Los Angeles refinery in El Segundo, California, ratified the U.S. oil producer's last, best and final contract offer on Wednesday, a United Steelworkers (USW) local union official said. 
The ratification at the southern California refinery comes as USW members at the company's San Francisco Bay-area refinery in Richmond remained on strike for a third day after twice rejecting a similar contract proposal.
David Campbell, secretary-treasurer of USW Local 12-675, which represents the El Segundo workers, declined to commment on the ratification vote. 
""We have negotiated in good faith for months to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with our employees who are represented by the USW Local 675,"" Chevron spokesperson Tyler Kruzich said, adding the company was pleased by the ratification. 
In Richmond, there has been no progress towards renewing talks between Chevron and USW Local 12-5, which represents the workers at the Richmond refinery, said BK White, first vice president of the local. 
Kruzich said the company looks forward to returning to the bargaining table as it continues to operate the Richmond refinery and deliver products to customers.
White said the expiration of a lease on neutral meeting site did not explain why the two sides have not met at the bargaining table since the strike began.
""I don't believe logistics is the reason we're not meeting,"" he said. 
Wholesale prices for California gasoline were unchanged on Wednesday, while retail prices for regular gasoline in the San Francisco Bay area remained between $5.59 and $6.19 per gallon where they have stayed since Sunday.

The 245,271 barrel-per-day (bpd) Richmond refinery has more than 500 union-represented employees while the 269,000-bpd El Segundo plant employs about 1,000 people. 
The two refineries supply about 20% of the gasoline in California and are major suppliers of fuel to Los Angeles and San Francisco-area airports.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -An inquiry has declared Australian casino operator Crown Resorts Ltd unfit for a gambling licence in Western Australia state but stopped short of revoking it, adding to the company's regulatory headache without threatening a lifeline takeover bid.
The adverse finding was widely expected after probes in the two other states where Crown has casinos brought similar results and largely completes the company's regulatory walk of shame without disrupting a $6.3 billion buyout from private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc that the company has backed.
The Western Australian inquiry took issue with Crown's failure to run effective anti-money laundering systems, but rather than cancelling its licence, recommended letting the company operate under government supervision for two years.
""This is about remediation rather than revocation, protecting the jobs of thousands of employees at the casino,"" said Western Australia gaming minister Tony Buti at a news conference.
State governments on both coasts ordered inquiries into the company founded by billionaire James Packer after media reports in 2019 accused it of knowingly dealing with foreign tour operators with ties to organised crime and turning a blind eye to money laundering.
Crown initially took out full-page newspaper advertisements to refute the allegations but acknowledged during hearings that they were largely true.
Nonetheless, governments have weighed the economic impact of cancelling the company's licence. In Victoria, where Crown makes three quarters of its profit, the company is the state's biggest single-site employer. That state also opted to put Crown under supervision for two years, rather than stop it taking bets entirely.
After an inquiry in New South Wales state declared the company unsuitable for its licence, the regulator issued a suspension just weeks before the company had opened a A$2.2 billion ($1.65 billion) Sydney waterfront resort in December 2020. Crown's Sydney licence remains suspended.
Crown in a statement acknowledged the Western Australian inquiry's recommendations and said it would ""work cooperatively and constructively with the Western Australian government"" to satisfy them.
The company had already made ""significant progress"" rebuilding its governance with a focus on responsible gambling and stamping out financial crime, said Chief Executive Steve McCann, who started in the role in October.
In the past year, Crown has replaced most of its board and senior management as it seeks to show regulators and governments that it is serious about fixing its culture. Packer also pulled his representative after an inquiry found the 37% owner inappropriately dominated the board.
Under the new leadership it has recommended Blackstone's buyout which many stakeholders see as a way out of an investment that has been bogged down by regulatory problems for years.
The remaining challenge for the company, and its planned sale, is a civil lawsuit from the Australian financial crime regulator which may result in fines of up to A$1.2 billion.
A Blackstone representative declined to comment.

Crown shares were up 0.6%, against a flat overall market, a sign of investor relief that the company could keep operating in Western Australia.

Volatile commodity prices added concerns to a market already dealing with record inflation and the impact of an ongoing war in Ukraine. U.S. Treasuries’ recovery from a recent selloff was also under scrutiny.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.09% by 10:08 PM ET (2:08 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan releasing the minutes from its last policy meeting earlier in the day.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.75% while in Australia, the ASX 200 inched up 0.08%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.77%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.62% and the Shenzhen Component fell 0.9%.
A recent rally in U.S. Treasuries was also on shaky ground, even as they clawed back some unprecedented losses. Buyers flooded the market, snapping up a sale of 20-year bonds, and the benchmark 10-year yield fell back to 2.3%.
The war in Ukraine, triggered by the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, shows no sign of ending, and concerns about the impact on the global economy led investors struggling to identify havens.
Russian President Vladimir Putin also advanced demands that dozens of countries use the Russian rouble to pay for natural gas purchases, causing European gas prices to swing sharply. The U.S. is also readying further sanctions on Russia that could be revealed as soon as Thursday.
The extreme volatility in commodity markets caused by the war in Ukraine, as well as the global response, is sapping liquidity, according to some of the world’s biggest trading houses.
However, the recent sharp rotation from bonds to equities could be losing momentum, and a more hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve to curb inflation also contributed to volatility.
“Markets are really latching onto these short-lived themes and that’s causing significant price movement,”  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute head of global asset allocation strategy Tracie McMillion told Bloomberg.
“We think that for the near term we are probably going to be able to avoid a recession, but we are growing a little bit more concerned about 2023.” Some equity investors could see the Fed’s tougher stance on inflation as a positive, at least for now, she added.
San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said both a 50 basis-point interest-rate hike and a decision to begin asset tapering could be warranted at the next Fed policy meeting in May 2022. On her part, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said Wednesday she supported front-loading rate increases in 2022.
“The Fed needs to build up its ammunition. Overall global growth is going to be dampened and they need to be able to cut rates later on should this have a greater-than-expected recessionary effect,” Matthews Asia portfolio manager Teresa Kong told Bloomberg.
U.S. President Joe Biden plans to reinstate exemptions from tariffs on about two-thirds of Chinese products that were previously granted waivers under his predecessor Donald Trump. Biden will also attend a NATO emergency summit in Brussels later in the day."

(Reuters) -Russia's communications regulator has blocked the news aggregator service of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, accusing it of allowing access to what it calls fake material about the country's military operation in Ukraine, Interfax news agency said on Wednesday.
""We’ve confirmed that some people are having difficulty accessing the Google News app and website in Russia and that this is not due to any technical issues on our end,"" Google said in statement.
""We’ve worked hard to keep information services like News accessible to people in Russia for as long as possible.""
Interfax said Roskomnadzor, the regulator, had acted on a request from the office of Russia's prosecutor general.

""The American online news resource in question provided access to numerous publications and materials containing inauthentic and publicly important information about the course of the special military operation on the territory of Ukraine,"" Interfax quoted the regulator as saying.
A new Russian law makes it illegal to report any event that could discredit the Russian military.

(Reuters) -A Texas jury on Wednesday found a former chief technical pilot for Boeing (NYSE:BA) not guilty of deceiving federal regulators who approved the company's 737 MAX jet which later was involved in two crashes that killed 346 people.
Former Boeing pilot Mark Forkner was indicted in October on charges of misleading U.S. regulators about a key flight control system and defrauding Boeing's U.S.-based airline customers of tens of millions of dollars by withholding information when they made their purchase decisions. 
The government alleged Forkner deceived the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) during its evaluation of Boeing’s 737 MAX airplane, which received FAA certification in 2017. 
Forkner, who had faced up to 20 years in prison on each of four counts, maintained his innocence and contended prosecutors were making him a scapegoat. The short trial began Friday in Texas.
A spokesman for the Justice Department, Joshua Stueve, said, ""While we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury’s verdict. The Justice Department stands by the hard work of the prosecutors and our law enforcement partners in investigating and trying this case.""
David Gerger, a lawyer for Forkner, in a statement praised the ""independent, smart, fair judge and jury."" The FAA and Boeing declined to comment.
The two crashes cost Boeing more than $20 billion and led to the plane's 20-month grounding until November 2020. Boeing was charged in 2021 with fraud conspiracy over the issue and agreed to pay $2.5 billion in a deal to avoid prosecution. 
The government had alleged Forkner provided the FAA Aircraft Evaluation Group with ""materially false, inaccurate, and incomplete information"" about a new part of the flight controls for the jet called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).
MCAS was tied to two fatal 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people in Ethiopia and Indonesia. But the government did not charge Forkner with causing those accidents. 
Prosecutors pointed to one message Forkner sent to a colleague in which he said he ""basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)"" about MCAS operations.

Families for the crash victims have objected to the Boeing settlement. In opposing their request that a judge overturn the deal, the Justice Department last month said its investigation did not produce definitive evidence on the cause of the crashes. 
Forkner is the only person criminally charged to date in connection with the MAX. The Justice Department in 2021 said the misconduct at Boeing was not facilitated by senior management.

239,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 08:25PM ET</span>",Toshiba's spin-off plan up against much opposition at Thursday's shareholder vote,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's troubled Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp goes into a critical shareholder vote later on Thursday facing very long odds for winning support for its plan to spin-off its devices business.
Its top three shareholders - Effissimo Capital Management, 3D Investment Partners and Farallon Capital Management - all activist shareholders with which Toshiba management has had a contentious history - oppose the plan as do proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis.
Also on the table is a proposal from Singapore-based 3D calling for Toshiba to solicit buyout offers from private equity - a motion that has the support of Effissimo, Farallon as well as Glass Lewis but, perhaps significantly, not ISS.
Each proposal needs 50% of the vote to pass.
Whatever the outcome, Thursday's vote represents another major battle in a four-year scandal-filled war being waged between the 146-year-old conglomerate and activist shareholders over the direction of the company. 
Toshiba management argues a spin-off is the best way to maximise shareholder value. Sources familiar with the matter have also said Toshiba hopes the plan would lift its share price to the point where activist shareholders would be enticed to leave.
Toshiba has rejected calls to seek a private equity buyout, arguing that potential offers suggested so far were insufficiently compelling and would raise concerns about the impact on its business and staff retention.
But opposition to Toshiba's plans has been widespread as well as vocal. Together, Effissimo, 3D and Farallon own around a quarter of Toshiba. All foreign activist funds combined are estimated to hold about 30% while more broadly overseas investors own 50% of the industrial conglomerate.
Prominent institutional investors which have disclosed they have voted against the spin-off include Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which owns 1.22%, the California Public Employees' Retirement System with 0.43% and the State Board of Administration of Florida with a 0.22% stake.
Large investors that have yet to reveal their votes include BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) which owns more than 5%, Elliott Management which, according to sources, has nearly 5% and Vanguard which has 2.6% according to Refinitiv data.
None of Japan's major domestic asset managers have revealed their voting plans.
UNEVEN SUPPORT FOR 3D PROPOSAL
If the spin-off proposal fails, hedge fund investors are likely to emerge emboldened, gaining momentum in their push for a buyout. But even if management wins, some shareholders plan to fight on regardless, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Toshiba said it will continue to make every effort to gain shareholder support for the break-up plan.
""Large shareholders will stay unless share prices go up,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.
""A private equity solution would be best for shareholders hoping for a quick exit with solid returns, but may not necessarily be best for Toshiba,"" he added.
Support for 3D's proposal is, however, somewhat less clear-cut than opposition to Toshiba's spin-off plan.
In addition to ISS advising against the proposal, CalPERS has voted against it. 
But Norway's sovereign wealth fund and Hong Kong-based activist fund Oasis Management have voted in favour as has Toshiba external director Raymond Zage, a Farallon adviser who says he is a top 100 shareholder and has broken ranks with the public stance of the board.
Toshiba's management has been under pressure from activist funds since it sold 600 billion yen ($5 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017. 

Acrimony between the two sides hit several boiling points in the past two years. Last June a shareholder-commissioned probe found Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry - which sees the conglomerate as a strategic asset due to its nuclear reactor and defence technology - to block overseas investors from gaining influence at its 2020 shareholder meeting.

A stablecoin is a kind of digital asset that is devised to keep its value stable in relation to another asset, and are frequently used as a portal to other cryptocurrencies or to generate income in decentralised financial systems.
ANZ said it has delivered the Australian dollar stablecoin, which it calls A$DC, to a private wealth management firm for digital assets - Victor Smorgon Group - through digital asset investment platform Zerocap.

The company's move to mint digital assets linked to the Australian dollar comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) said last year the growth of digital wallets could allow the exchange of tokens or digital forms of money that could be backed by the RBA, even as the central bank remains sceptical of the digital currency.
ANZ, the country's number three lender, said it has minted 30 million of A$DC using a smart contract and the coins were transferred between the parties and later redeemed back into Fiat currency.

GameStop, AMC shares rocket higher","NEW YORK (Reuters) -More than a year after retail investors, aided by social media, forced an epic squeeze of a handful of heavily shorted stocks, a few of the famous ""meme"" stocks were back in the fast lane this week. 
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) surged 14.5% on Wednesday and AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings ended the session up 13.6%.
While GameStop shares were boosted by Chairman Ryan Cohen's disclosure that his investment company bought 100,000 shares of the video game retailer, the increase extends the 30% rally on Tuesday, which had no apparent catalyst.
GameStop and AMC were the top two most trending stocks on the retail investor-focused stocktwits.com on Wednesday.
""This has probably occurred because we’re in a weak market environment, likely investment managers who short are looking for opportunities and they’ve gone back to those historically tried and true names,"" said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder in New York. 
""That provides an opportunity for these investors to try to create a short squeeze,"" Ghriskey added. ""It causes a frenzy in the shorting community and it can close a hedge fund"" with extensive short positions.
Other companies associated with the trend, also referred to as ""stonks"" on social media, like Blackberry (TSX:BB), Koss Corp and Sundial Growers (NASDAQ:SNDL), advanced between 1.4% and 4.2%.
Netherlands-based electric vehicle charging company Allego NV joined the fray, skyrocketing 114.1%.
Even with today's rally, GameStop, AMC, Blackberry and Koss are down between 5% and 24%, year-to-date. 

This stands in stark contrast to the short-squeeze frenzy of January 2021, when GameStop and AMC skyrocketed by 1,600% and 750%, respectively, over just a few sessions.
On Tuesday, short sellers in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc , GameStop and AMC lost $2.32 billion, according to S3 Partners.

SAN FRANCISCO/SEOUL (Reuters) -LG Energy Solution (LGES), a supplier for electric car makers Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Lucid, said on Thursday in Korea it plans to invest 1.7 trillion Korean won ($1.4 billion) to build a battery factory in Arizona by 2024 to meet demand from ""prominent startups"" and other North American customers. 
This will be its first U.S. factory to make cylindrical cells, a type of battery that has been used in Tesla and Lucid vehicles, LGES said. Construction will begin in the second quarter of 2022, with mass production to start in 2024 with production capacity of 11 gigawatt hours, LGES said in a statement.
Earlier, Reuters reported that potential customers would include EV makers Tesla, Lucid and Proterra and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), maker of IQOS heated-tobacco sticks, among others. The report cited people familiar with the matter. 
LGES said in a statement that it plans to consider securing additional production capacity at its Arizona factory in the future.
""The Arizona factory could add further production capacity in the future as we are seeing growing demand for cylindrical batteries from various customers, including automakers and power tool makers,"" said an official at LGES. 
On Tuesday, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said battery production would be ""the limiting factor"" for vehicle production in two to three years. He has called on suppliers to raise production, while Tesla starts making cells itself. 
Tesla, Lucid and Proterra did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Philip Morris declined to comment. 
Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp, a Tesla supplier, along with Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd, is also looking to invest billions of dollars to build a factory to make a new type of electric vehicle (EV) battery for Tesla, public broadcaster NHK reported this month.
Panasonic is looking at building the factory in either Oklahoma or Kansas, not far from Tesla's new Texas vehicle plant, NHK reported.
Lucid Chief Financial Officer Sherry House told Reuters last month the company, which has a car factory in Arizona, had signed multi-year supply agreements with two battery suppliers, and the agreement ""does have some capacity coming from state-side cell lines.""
She did not identify the companies. Lucid sources batteries from LGES and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI. 

LGES, which raised more than $10 billion in its initial public offering in Korea in January, has announced a flurry of battery joint ventures with GM and Stellantis in the United States and Canada.
In August, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric.

245,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 06:29PM ET</span>","As sanctions bite Russia, fertilizer shortage imperils world food supply","By Tom Polansek and Ana Mano
CHICAGO(Reuters) - Sky-high fertilizer prices have farmers worldwide scaling back its use and reducing the amount of land they're planting, fallout from the Ukraine-Russia conflict that has some agricultural industry veterans warning of food shortages.
Western sanctions on Russia, a major exporter of potash, ammonia, urea and other soil nutrients, have disrupted shipments of those key inputs around the globe. Fertilizer is key to keeping corn, soy, rice and wheat yields high. Growers are scrambling to adjust.
The pivot can be seen in agricultural powerhouse Brazil, where some farmers are applying less fertilizer to their corn, and some federal legislators are pushing to open protected indigenous lands for the mining of potash. In Zimbabwe and Kenya, small farmers are reverting to using manure to nourish their crops. In Canada, one canola farmer has already stockpiled fertilizer for the 2023 season in anticipation of even higher prices ahead.
Farmers elsewhere are making similar moves. Reuters spoke with 34 people on six continents, including grain producers, agriculture analysts, traders and farm groups. All expressed concern about the cost and availability of fertilizer.
In the United States alone, fertilizer bills are expected to jump 12% this year, after rising 17% in 2021, according to American Farm Bureau Federation and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data.
Some growers are contemplating switching to crops that require fewer nutrients. Others plan to cultivate less acreage. Others say they'll simply use less fertilizer, a strategy crop experts predict will hurt yields. Production is most at risk in developing nations, whose farmers have fewer financial resources to weather the storm, said Tony Will, chief executive of Illinois-based CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF), a leading producer of nitrogen fertilizer.
""My concern at the moment is actually one of a food crisis on a global basis,"" Will told Reuters.
On Saturday, Peru declared a state of emergency in its agriculture sector over fears of food insecurity.
The decree said the nation’s planted areas have fallen 0.2% since August due to rising fertilizer prices, and that the volume of grain Peru imports for animal feed has likewise declined over cost concerns. The government is now drafting a plan to increase the country's food supply. DOUBLE WHAMMY Global fertilizer prices were already high prior to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbor, as record natural gas and coal prices forced some fertilizer makers to cut output in that energy-hungry sector. Ukraine's cities have been besieged by missiles, tanks and troops in what Moscow has dubbed a ""special operation” to demilitarize the country. Russia denies targeting civilians in the conflict.
Western nations responded with tough economic sanctions on Russia, while the United States and the European Union imposed new sanctions on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has provided support for Russia's offensive.
Combined, Russia and Belarus accounted for more than 40% of global exports of potash last year, one of three critical nutrients used to boost crop yields, Dutch lender Rabobank said this month. Additionally, Russia accounted for about 22% of global exports of ammonia, 14% of the world's urea exports and about 14% of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) - all key kinds of fertilizers.
Sanctions have disrupted sales of fertilizer and crops from Russia. Many Western banks and traders are steering clear of Russian supplies for fear of running afoul of the rapidly changing rules, while shipping firms are avoiding the Black Sea region due to safety concerns.
It all amounts to a double whammy for the global food supply.
Russia and Ukraine are major grain producers. Together they account for about 30% of global wheat exports and 20% of corn exports. Grain shipments through the Black Sea have already been disrupted. Stalled deliveries from those two countries have helped spur galloping global food inflation. The World Bank said last week that a number of developing countries face near-term wheat supply shortages due to their high dependence on Ukrainian exports.
But the fertilizer crisis is in some respects more worrying because it could inhibit food production in the rest of the world that could help take up the slack, said Maximo Torero, chief economist for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.
""If we don't resolve the problem of fertilizer, and trade of fertilizers doesn't continue, then we'll have a very serious problem of (food) supply next year,"" Torero told Reuters. BRAZIL AT RISK Brazil, the world's biggest soybean exporter, relies heavily on imported fertilizers such as potash, which accounted for 38% of the crop nutrients it used last year. Russia and Belarus were the source of half of those shipments.
Prior to the Ukraine-Russia conflict, Brazilian farmers were already reducing corn plantings due to rising fertilizer prices. Soybean cultivation will likely be impacted as well, with growers expanding more slowly than in previous years, according to Agroconsult, a Brazilian agriculture consulting firm.
In the west-central state of Mato Grosso, farmer Cayron Giacomelli told Reuters he has already reduced fertilizer use on his current corn crop. He said he'll do the same when he plants soybeans later this year, a move he reckons might shrink his harvest by at least 8%.
Giacomelli said fertilizer is hard to get and that some dealers won't finalize sales until cargo ships dock in Brazil. He's still kicking himself for not closing a purchase he was negotiating just before Russia invaded Ukraine. ""I got distracted and now am paying more,"" Giacomelli said.
Lawmakers from Brazilian farm states, meanwhile, are pushing for legislation that would open indigenous lands in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to potash mining. That measure is opposed by members of the local Mura tribe, who say mining would despoil the natural habitat upon which they depend. The bill is still making its way through the nation's congress.
In Zimbabwe, scarce and pricy imports have forced corn growers such as Boniface Mutize to make their own fertilizer. ""We mix cow dung or chicken waste with zinc,"" he said.
It's the same in rural Kenya. Farmer Mary Kamau said she, too, has slashed purchases of commercial fertilizer and is using manure to nourish the coffee and avocados she grows on 12 acres in Murang'a County. She worries about the consequences for her family. ""If I don’t get a good harvest, I don't get good prices. And that will affect me for the next two years – it's not just this season,"" Kamau said.
FEWER ACRES, LESS FERTILIZER
In the United States, fifth-generation New Mexico farmer Mike Berry has similar worries. He recently paid $680 a ton for liquid nitrogen to fertilize his corn crop, an ""exorbitant"" price he said was 232% above last year's price.
Berry said he plans to cut his spring plantings of corn for livestock feed to about 300 acres from his usual 400 to 600 acres. Berry said he will also reduce applications of liquid nitrogen by about 30%, which could drop his yields by 25%.
Bottom line: ""We're going to produce less,"" he said.
That might seem short-sighted considering commodity prices have jumped sharply in recent weeks. But the cost of growing crops is outpacing potential revenue for many farmers.
""Planting decisions are increasingly being made not on market fundamentals but rather on the cost of production driven by the price and supply of fertilizer,"" dozens of U.S. lawmakers wrote in a March 17 letter to the U.S. International Trade Commission. They were seeking relief from duties on fertilizer imports from Morocco and Trinidad and Tobago.
U.S. farmer Don Batie described the stressful process of securing enough fertilizer for this year's planting.
""It's nuts,"" said Batie, who grows corn and soybeans on 1,500 acres in Lexington, Nebraska. ""By the time they get a price and they quote it to you, the price changes."" 
WHERE TO BUY?
Asia is struggling, too.
India, which imports fertilizer for its sprawling agriculture sector, is increasingly turning to Canada and Israel to replace its Russian supplies.
Thailand, meanwhile, is facing pressure on its signature rice crop. Russia and Belarus accounted for about 12% of its fertilizer imports last year, Thai government data show. But buying from elsewhere could prove tricky, in part because domestic price controls on fertilizer are squeezing Thai importers as global market prices explode, according to Plengsakdi Prakaspesat, president of the Thai Fertilizer and Agricultural Supplies Association.
""If you’re a merchant, and you're absolutely going to lose money, will you still import more stuff?"" Plengsakdi said.
China last year imposed fertilizer export curbs to protect its own farmers as global prices soared due to strong demand and high energy prices. Beijing was expected to ease those restrictions this year, potentially boosting world supply, said Gavin Ju, principal fertilizer analyst in the Shanghai office of commodities consultancy CRU. But he said that's less likely now with the global market in chaos.
Concerns over rising inflation and a protracted Ukraine war have some farmers planning well ahead.

In Manitoba, Canada, corn and canola farmer Bert Peeter recently agreed to spend more than $500,000 Canadian dollars buying 80% of the fertilizer he'll need - for 2023. Although prices are soaring, he figured things could still get worse. 
This ""might not be over after one year,"" Peeter said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chief executives of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and other carriers on Wednesday urged U.S. President Joe Biden to end a federal mask mandate on airplanes and international pre-departure testing requirements.
The airline executives, including the chairman of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and JetBlue's CEO, said in a letter the restrictions ""are no longer aligned with the realities of the current epidemiological environment.""
The Biden administration this month opted to extend current COVID-19 mask requirements at airports, train stations, ride share vehicles and other transit modes through April 18. The order was set to expire on March 18.
""It makes no sense that people are still required to wear masks on airplanes, yet are allowed to congregate in 
crowded restaurants, schools and at sporting events without masks, despite none of these venues having the protective air filtration system that aircraft do,"" the airline letter said.
The White House declined to comment, but earlier this month said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was working to help develop ""a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor.""
Delta CEO Ed Bastian in a separate statement https://news.delta.com/delta-asks-biden-administration-end-covid-era-travel-restrictions said ""considering the improved public health metrics in the U.S. and medical advancements to prevent the worst outcomes of COVID-19, the federal mask mandate and pre-departure testing no longer fits with the current environment."" 
The letter also made reference to ""thousands of airline employees charged with enforcing"" the COVID rules.
The mask requirements have resulted in significant friction on airplanes. The Federal Aviation Administration says since January 2021, there have been a record 6,942 unruly passenger incidents reported - and 70% involved masking rules
Last week, the U.S. Senate voted 57 to 40 to overturn the 13-month-old public health order requiring masks on airplanes and other forms of public transportation, a move that drew a quick veto threat from Biden.
The mask mandate has drawn significant opposition from Republicans who noted the CDC says 99.5% of Americans live in places where it is safe to ditch indoor masks.

The letter cited the CDC data arguing ""the science clearly supports lifting the mask mandate.""
The 2021 CDC order said the mask mandate could help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in crowded transport settings.

WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Chinese emergency workers found on Wednesday one of two black boxes from a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) plane that crashed with 132 people onboard, but U.S. efforts to join the investigation are on hold because of COVID-19 quarantine rules.
The black box device recovered is the plane's cockpit voice recorder, based on an early assessment, a Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) official told a media briefing, adding that the recording material appeared to have survived impact in relatively good shape.
Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming to Guangzhou on the coast on Monday when the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 jet suddenly plunged from cruising altitude at about the time when it should have started its descent before landing.
The cause of the crash has yet to be determined. Most of the jet appears to have disintegrated upon impact, although some debris and human remains have been found. 
""An initial inspection showed that the exterior of the recorder has been severely damaged, but the storage units, while also damaged to some extent, are relatively complete,"" CAAC official Zhu Tao said.
The black box is being sent to an institute in Beijing for decoding, although how long that takes would depend on the extent of the damage, Zhu said.
Weather along the flight path on Monday did not pose any danger to the aircraft and air controllers had communication with it after take-off and prior to its rapid descent, said Mao Yanfeng, head of aircraft investigation at CAAC.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday that Chinese authorities had invited the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to take part in the investigation of the crash, adding that he was very encouraged by the invitation to be on the ground in China.
The NTSB, however, later said it had not yet determined if investigators would travel to China in light of visa and quarantine requirements.
""We are working with the Department of State to address those issues with the Chinese government before any travel will be determined,"" the NTSB said.
China has very few COVID cases and strict requirements for at least two weeks of hotel quarantine on arrival for citizens and foreigners. A World Health Organization team that last year investigated the origins of the pandemic had to quarantine first.
The crash investigation is being led by China but the United States is invited to take part because the plane was manufactured there.
The Chinese authorities have said the plane, which did not respond to repeated calls during its descent, met airworthiness standards before take-off and all three pilots - one more than normally required on a 737 - were in good health.
The captain, hired in January 2018, had 6,709 hours flying experience, while the first and second officers had 31,769 hours and 556 hours, respectively, a China Eastern official said.
""From what we know, the performance of the three pilots had been good and their family life relatively harmonious,"" the official said.
One co-pilot was an observer to build up experience, the airline said.
EXTRA PRECAUTIONS
China Eastern tightened precautions after the crash, requiring two senior captains and a senior co-pilot on a three-person crew on some aircraft types, state-backed The Paper said.
Heavy rain in southern China on Wednesday hampered the search for victims and black boxes, with wet weather forecast to last the rest of the week. 
Grief-stricken relatives visited the site, among them a retiree surnamed Zhang from Shenzhen, whose eyes filled with tears as he told Reuters his nephew was onboard.
""I hope the country can thoroughly investigate this matter and find out whether it was the manufacturer's fault or it was a maintenance problem,"" Zhang said. 
CAAC has launched a two-week inspection of the sector, involving checks on all regional air traffic control centres, airline companies and flight training institutes to ensure ""absolute"" safety.
FlightRadar24 data showed the aircraft plunged rapidly at a rate of 31,000 feet per minute.
China has improved air safety over the past two decades, and Monday's disaster was the first major crash in a dozen years.

China Eastern and two subsidiaries have grounded their fleet of more than 200 Boeing 737-800 jets. An airline official said the move was more an emergency reaction to the crash rather than a response to any safety issue.
The disaster comes as Boeing is working to recover from several crises, notably safety concerns over its 737 MAX model following two deadly crashes and the impact on travel from the pandemic.

248,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 05:41PM ET</span>",Explainer-How black boxes of crashed Chinese jet will be handled,"By Tim Hepher and Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Chinese authorities said on Wednesday they had recovered one of the black boxes of a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) jet that plunged into a mountainside on Monday with 132 people on board.
The device recovered is the plane's cockpit voice recorder, based on an early assessment, an official from China's aviation regulator said, adding that the recording material appeared to have survived impact in relatively good shape.
Both of the jet's black boxes were manufactured by Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), the regulator said, without naming the models.
This is how the black box readout process works.
WHAT ARE BLACK BOXES?
They are not actually black but high-visibility orange. Experts disagree how the nickname originated but it has become synonymous with the quest for answers when planes crash.
Many historians attribute their invention to Australian scientist David Warren in the 1950s. They are mandatory.
The aim is not to establish legal liability but to identify causes and help prevent accidents.
HOW HAVE THEY EVOLVED?
The earliest devices recorded limited data on wire or foil. Modern ones use solid state memory.
The recordings are housed inside crash-survivable containers able to withstand 3,400 times the force of gravity on impact.
Both black box recordings were recovered from a Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX crash in March 2019 that, like the China Eastern plane, dove into the ground at a very high velocity.
HOW BIG ARE THEY?
They weigh about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and contain four main parts:
* a chassis or interface designed to secure the device and facilitate recording and playback
* an underwater locator beacon
* the core housing or ""Crash-Survivable Memory Unit"" made of stainless steel or titanium
* inside there, the recordings on chips or older formats.
There are two recorders: a cockpit voice recorder (CVR) for pilot voices and cockpit sounds, and a flight data recorder (FDR) that captures information on parameters including altitude, airspeed, heading and engine thrust.
HOW WILL THE RECORDERS BE HANDLED?
Technicians peel away protective material and carefully clean connections to make sure they do not accidentally erase data. The audio or data file must be downloaded and copied.
The data itself means nothing at first. It must be decoded from raw files before being turned into graphs.
Investigators sometimes use ""spectral analysis"" - a way of examining sounds that allows scientists to pick out barely audible alarms or the first fleeting crack of an explosion.
HOW MUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?
It will depend on the exact models of the Honeywell recorders, which has not been disclosed. 
An Air India Express 737-800 with two Honeywell black boxes that crashed in 2020 after overshooting a runway in heavy rain had a CVR capable of 120 minutes of digital audio, according to a final report into the crash.
That would be more than enough to cover the 66-minute China Eastern flight.
The FDR on the Air India Express plane recorded about 25 hours of flight data. 
WHERE WILL THE DATA BE READ?
The first black box discovered is being sent to an institute in Beijing for decoding, although how long that takes would depend on the extent of the damage, said Zhu Tao, an official at China's aviation regulator.
WHEN WILL RESULTS BE MADE PUBLIC?

Interim reports into a crash are published after a month but are often sparse. Deeper investigations take a year or more to complete.
Experts say air accidents are usually caused by a cocktail of factors.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) said on Wednesday hundreds of its customers may have been affected by a security breach involving hacking group Lapsus$, amid criticism of the digital authentication firm's slow response to the intrusion that knocked its shares down about 11 percent.
The breach sparked concern because the cyber extortion gang had posted what appeared to be internal screenshots from within the organization's network roughly a day ago.
Okta's Chief Security Officer David Bradbury said in a series of blog posts that the ""maximum potential impact"" was to 366 customers whose data was accessed by an outside contractor.
The contractor, the Miami-based Sitel Group, employed an engineer whose laptop the hackers had hijacked, Bradbury said, adding that the 366 figure represented a ""worst case scenario"" and that the hackers had been constrained in their range of possible actions.
A representative for Sykes, a subsidiary of the Sitel Group, said in an emailed statement that the company was unable to comment on its relationship to its customers but it undertook an ""immediate and comprehensive"" investigation into the breach and had since determined there was no longer a security risk.
San Francisco-based Okta helps employees of more than 15,000 organizations securely access their networks and applications, so any breach there could have serious consequences.
Bradbury said the intruders would have been unable to perform actions such as downloading customer databases or accessing Okta's source code.
Okta, whose market capitalization is $26 billion, has been criticized for its reaction to the hack, which struck some experts as initially dismissive. The disquiet increased when it emerged that the company either had known - or could have known - that there was a problem much earlier.
Okta first got wind of a potential breach in January, Bradbury said, explaining that it warned the Sitel Group right away. But it was only on March 10 that Sitel received a forensic report about the incident, giving Okta a summary of the findings a week later.

Bradbury said he was ""greatly disappointed by the long period of time that transpired between our notification to Sitel and the issuance of the complete investigation report.""
The hack - and Okta's reaction to it - has made some investors nervous. The 10.74 percent fall in share price was the worst one-day percentage drop since 2018, and Raymond James Equity Research downgraded the stock from ""strong buy"" to ""market perform,"" in part citing Okta's handling of the incident.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) on Wednesday said it would allow  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) to use its own payment system in its Android app as part of a new pilot aimed at countering appmakers' concerns about high fees and allegedly anticompetitive behavior.
Users who have downloaded Spotify from the Google Play Store will be presented with a choice to pay with either Spotify's payment system or with Google Play Billing in some countries in the coming months.
The pilot will allow a small number of participating developers, starting with Spotify, to offer an additional billing option next to Google Play's billing system in their apps.
""This pilot will help us to increase our understanding of whether and how user choice billing works for users in different countries and for developers of different sizes and categories,"" Google said in a blog post.
Under a new competition law in South Korea last year, Google also said it would allow developers to introduce a second payment system alongside its own there.
Spotify said its trial with Google was part of a ""multi-year agreement,"" without elaborating.
App developers such as Spotify that sell digital goods have complained for years about having to use the official payment systems of the Play store and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store. 
Google and Apple collect up to 30% of each payment as a fee, which developers say is too high. Both have lowered fees in many circumstances and have said that they are needed to fund a safe and secure mobile ecosystem.

Google did not specify the fee that it would collect in the new pilot.
The company is ramping up enforcement of its Google Play Billing requirement, and it has said non-compliant apps could be blocked from publishing updates starting on Friday.

The request is contained in a letter that is expected to be sent to Telecom Italia (TIM) later on Wednesday, the person added.
KKR in November submitted a non-binding 10.8 billion euro takeover proposal for TIM after investing 1.8 billion euros last year for a 37.5% stake in the group's last-mile fixed-line network. 
Telecom Italia left the New York-based fund waiting nearly four months without an answer. But its board this month agreed to engage in talks, and gave its top executives a mandate to determine the scope and length of KKR's possible due diligence analysis. KKR had asked in November for a four week due diligence period.
TIM has said that its board also told CEO Pietro Labriola and Chairman Salvatore Rossi to better understand the terms of KKR's offer, asking in particular what effect it would have on TIM's already high debt. 
Debt normally amounts to the bulk of the financing of buyout offers such as KKR's. But TIM's debt load, which amounts to 22 billion euros, will make it hard for KKR to load it up with more debt if it completes the deal - as buyout firms typically do, bankers have said.
KKR in its letter on Wednesday said that the financial structure of the company would not change substantially were its offer to go through, according to the source. 

In the latest sign of the group's financial fragility, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) on Wednesday cut its debt rating of TIM to 'BB' with a negative outlook.
The decision follows debt downgrades by Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service and Fitch Ratings after TIM unveiled a record 2021 loss and a weak outlook as the new CEO Labriola presented a plan to separate its network assets from its services arm.

Toyota's Sienna minivans, retrofitted with Aurora's self-driving system, will be tested on highways and suburban streets in the Dallas-Fort-Worth area, with the operation including trips enroute to an airport. 
Autonomous vehicle startups are under pressure to generate meaningful revenue from billions of dollars of engineering investment, but scaling up the fleet is a challenge as technological hurdles remain. 
""The route showcases Aurora's ability to safely operate at highway speeds, a key technical differentiator that allows it to prioritize popular and lucrative rides,"" the U.S. company said in a statement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - All three major U.S. stock indexes ended more than 1% lower on Wednesday as oil prices jumped and Western leaders began gathering in Brussels to plan more measures to pressure Russia to halt its conflict in Ukraine. 
Responding to Western sanctions that have hit Russia's economy hard, President Vladimir Putin said Moscow will seek payment in roubles for natural gas sales from ""unfriendly"" countries, while its forces bombed areas of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv a month into their assault.
Oil prices rallied 5% to over $121 a barrel and natural gas futures also jumped. [O/R] While higher oil prices benefit energy shares, they are a negative for consumers and many businesses. The S&P 500 energy sector rose 1.7% and utilities gained 0.2%, while all of the other major S&P 500 sectors were lower on the day.
""These geopolitical problems are sort of hanging over the market,"" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. 
""The resurgence of oil prices is giving people pause,"" he said, adding, ""There needs to be a resolution with Russia. That's going to hold the market back.""
The day's decline follows a recent string of gains as the market recovered from lows hit amid the conflict and increased worries about inflation and higher interest rates.
Among the day's biggest drags, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Inc's stock slid 9.3% after the Photoshop maker late Tuesday forecast downbeat second-quarter revenue and profit and sees an impact on fiscal 2022 revenue due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 448.96 points, or 1.29%, to 34,358.5, the S&P 500 lost 55.37 points, or 1.23%, to 4,456.24 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.21 points, or 1.32%, to 13,922.60.
Investors continued to assess the outlook for U.S. interest rates. San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly said on Wednesday she is open to raising rates by 50 basis points in May, joining other policymakers in saying so.
Last week, the U.S. central bank raised interest rates for the first time since 2018.
Alphabet-owned Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said it will pause all ads containing content that exploits, dismisses or condones the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Its stock fell 1.1%.

Investing.com – Stocks fell on Wednesday on the prospect of more sanctions by the West on Russia and higher oil prices.
President Joe Biden headed to Brussels for a meeting with members of the G-7 and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the situation in Ukraine as Russia continued its attack.
The White House and Allies are preparing to unveil additional sanctions, including on members of Russia’s parliament. Oil returned to near $120 a barrel, stoking concerns higher fuel prices would sap the economic recovery just as the Federal Reserve starts to rein in its stimulus programs.
Already food and other household items are more expensive, and some states have suspended their own tax on gasoline to ease prices at the pump for American drivers.
More Fed officials spoke this week about the need to raise interest rates more aggressively, fanning expectations the central bank will make two half-point hikes at its next two meetings. The Fed normally raises rates in quarter-point increments, as it did last week for the first time since it began its pandemic-era stimulus.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Meme stocks
The meme stock crowd appears to be coming to life lately. Shares of GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) jumped Wednesday after chairman Ryan Cohen increased his stake, buying another 100,000 shares.
The purchase takes Cohen's slice of the video game retailer to 11.9% as he tries to pivot the company in light of a changing market. The gain in GameStop stock adds to a nearly 30% rally during Tuesday's session.
Cohen, who co-founded pet retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), acquired the shares through his investment company RC Ventures and paid between $96.81 and $108.82 for the stake, according to a filing.
2. Home builders
KB Home (NYSE:KBH) shares dropped 5.7% in extended trading, adding to the regular session's 4.6% loss after the company reported earnings that missed expectations.
The homebuilding company announced earnings per share of $1.47 on revenue of $1.4 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $1.54 on revenue of $1.5 billion. The company said supply chain issues intensified and an already-constrained construction labor force was further stressed, which extended build times and delayed completions and planned deliveries.
3. Oil prices
Oil is bouncing back above $120 a barrel after U.S. government data showed weekly consumption far beyond market estimates, while major producer Russia continued to cite outages on the Caspian pipeline that played on the nerves of traders.
U.S. crude’s West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, benchmark is up about 9% on the week.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 04:32PM ET</span>","Wall Street pulls back on stocks, Treasury yields dip","By Lawrence Delevingne
(Reuters) -Wall Street pushed stocks and Treasury yields down on Wednesday after both had powered higher earlier in the week as investors took in the strength of the economy and hawkish comments from U.S. policymakers. 
Two-year U.S. Treasury yields have risen sharply so far in March and were set for their biggest monthly jump since 2004. Investors have been relatively sanguine about the implications of higher yields on stock market valuations, with many choosing to buy back in after a bruising few months for equity prices. 
That narrative took a pause on Wednesday as major U.S. equities indexes declined more than 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 448.96 points, or 1.29%, to 34,358.5; the S&P 500 lost 55.41 points, or 1.23%, to 4,456.2; and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 186.21 points, or 1.32%, to 13,922.60.
European stocks also fell about 1%, with a pan-European equity benchmark hitting a new one-month high in early London trading before falling back as traders took profits. MSCI's broadest gauge of world stocks declined 0.9%.
Investors were still trying to make up their minds about interest rates and stocks. 
""Although there is widespread criticism, it's too early to take the view that the Fed won't be able to negotiate the fine line of reducing inflation without derailing growth,"" said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer, UBS Global Wealth Management. 
""Given a higher degree of uncertainty, rather than make a directional play on stocks moving higher, we prefer selected overweight and underweight positions, yielding an overall neutral allocation to equities."" 
BOND SELL-OFF
The most eye-catching moves recently have been in the bond market, although there was some reversal on Wednesday. The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, was down 4.8 basis points at 2.107%. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 7.6 basis points to 2.301%.
The sharp rise in short-dated yields has flattened the gap between two- and 10-year U.S. yields to its lowest levels since the coronavirus pandemic hit global markets in March 2020. An inverted yield curve is widely seen as a predictor of future U.S. recessions. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) market strategists wrote in a recent note that markets have rebounded recently because investors are ""looking through the hawkish Fed and ominous signal"" from the rates curve flattening.
""We believe this is warranted given strong economic fundamentals, our expectation the (two-year and 10-year Treasury) curve will stay positive this year, and moderating risks of large energy supply disruptions,"" they wrote. 
The economics conversation came as Western leaders began gathering in Brussels to plan more measures to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt his month-old Ukraine campaign; Putin, in response, said Moscow planned to switch its gas sales to ""unfriendly"" countries to roubles.
Oil prices rose in volatile trading on Wednesday, supported by disruption of Russian and Kazakh crude exports. U.S. crude recently rose 4.71% to $114.42 per barrel and Brent was at $121.37, up 5.1% on the day.
Gold prices also gained on Wednesday as investors looked to shield against soaring inflation and uncertainty caused by events in Ukraine, with elevated U.S. bond yields capping gains in non-interest-bearing metal. Spot gold added 1.3% to $1,946.44 an ounce.
Currency market activity continued to be relatively subdued, confirming the lack of clear directional trends.

Against the U.S. dollar, the yen was up about 0.25% by 2000 GMT/4 pm ET, but held around 121 yen after Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said it was premature to debate the exit from ultra-loose monetary policy.
The euro and sterling fell about 0.25% and 0.4% respectively against a broadly stronger dollar.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday as investors continued to digest the recent moves by the Federal Reserve ahead of President Joe Biden’s trip to Europe to discuss further sanctions on Russia. Falling bond yields hit bank shares.
At 4:16 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 448 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 1.2% and the NASDAQ Composite was down 1.3%.
The three main indexes on Wall Street closed higher Tuesday, with the Dow climbing over 250 points, or 0.7%, the S&P rising 1.1% and the Nasdaq gaining 2%.
The Federal Reserve raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point at its meeting last week, the first increase since December 2018, and Chairman Jerome Powell pointed Monday to more aggressive moves in the future in order to combat soaring inflation.
San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, normally seen as leaning toward the dovish end of the spectrum, added her voice Tuesday to those calling for the Fed to raise interest rates quickly.
Russia’s ongoing war with Ukraine and the associated sanctions have exacerbated already high energy and commodity prices, adding to the concerns the U.S. central bank has over domestic inflation. 
President Joe Biden traveled to Europe Wednesday to meet with allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Union to discuss the West’s response to Russia, amid expectations that further measures to punish Moscow are likely.
The war in Ukraine continued to rage on Wednesday, with Russian troops continuing to bombard the capital Kyiv, Chernihiv, and the Black Sea port of Mariupol.
In the corporate sector, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock slipped premarket, the software giant beat its first quarter targets, but disappointed with its guidance, while BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) stock was still ticking up after it announced job cuts and the departure of top editors.
Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) posted an 8% rise in fourth quarter revenue, its slowest growth since going public in 2004.  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) and Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) also report results Wednesday. 
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday after industry data pointed to another drop in U.S. crude inventories, while European countries continue to debate sanctions on Russian energy exports.
Tuesday’s numbers from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stocks in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, confounding expectations for a small increase. 
The official government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the session. 
By 4:16 PM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 5% higher at $114.78 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 5.3% to $121.65.
Additionally, gold futures rose 1.4% to $1,947/oz.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed lower Wednesday, led by bank stocks as Treasury yields retreated after rising oil prices renewed worries about the inflation drag on global growth.
The S&P 500 fell 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.3%, or 448 points, the Nasdaq slipped 1.3%.
Crude oil exports from Kazakhstan's Caspian Pipeline Consortium terminal, which are shipped via the Russian port of Novorossiysk, were suspended following weather-related disruptions, triggering fresh fears of supply shortages.
The move higher in oil prices returned focus to the threat higher inflation poses to global growth just as investors mull the prospect of the Fed hiking rates more aggressively at its meetings in May and June.
St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard reiterated on Wednesday the Fed needs to act ""faster"" on raising interest rates as inflation is ""way over"" the central bank's target. 
The market currently expects the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points at its May and June meetings.  
The bets on a hawkish Fed exacerbated worries the Fed may overshoot of rate hikes and slow the economy into recession, triggering a fresh flight to safe heavens such as bonds.
Treasury yields, which trade inversely to prices, fell and weighed on bank stocks.  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC),  First Republic Bank  (NYSE:FRC) led the move lower.
Tech, which tends to benefit from the falling rates, was mostly in the red, though Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) bucked the trend, to close up nearly 1% higher. 
Apple’s iPhone 13 is seeing “stellar” demand globally, and likely “setting up for a monster growth cycle over the next 12 to 18 that is not baked into shares at current levels,” Wedbush said in a note.
Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell as much as 9% after its software guidance overshadowed quarterly results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, and stoked fears about peaking growth.  
“These results further support our thesis of peaking net new DM ARR, which we have believed would result in less forward upside to consensus estimates and drive decelerating revenue growth, which we anticipated will weigh on the stock’s performance,” Credit Suisse said in a note as it cut its price target on the stock to $525 from $625.
 General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), meanwhile, gained more than 2% after raising its full-year outlook following better-than-expected quarterly earnings.
Meme stocks remained on the comeback trail. GameStop (NYSE:GME) added 14% to its 30% gain a day earlier after GameStop Chair Ryan Cohen on Tuesday bought an additional 100,000 shares, expanding his stake in the video game retailer to 11.9%.
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) was up 14%. 
In other news, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) fell 10% after confirming that a hacking group known as Lapsus$ had carried out a cyber attack, though said security protocols contained the hack."

(Reuters) - Alphabet-owned Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will not help websites, apps and YouTube channels sell ads alongside content that it deems exploits, dismisses or condones the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, the U.S. company said Wednesday.
Google, whose advertising software helps publishers generate revenue, bars ads from appearing next to content that incites violence and denies tragic events. It is broadly applying those policies to the war.
""We can confirm that we're taking additional steps to clarify, and in some instances expand our monetization guidelines as they relate to the war in Ukraine,"" Google spokesman Michael Aciman said.
In an email to publishers seen by Reuters, Google said ads would not run alongside, for example, ""claims that imply victims are responsible for their own tragedy or similar instances of victim blaming, such as claims that Ukraine is committing genocide or deliberately attacking its own citizens.""
Google also bars ads that capitalize on sensitive events and has applied that policy to the war.
Senior Russian officials say Western media has misreported the conflict in Ukraine, which it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize the country.
Interfax news agency reported on Wednesday that Russia's communications regulator had blocked Google's aggregator service Google News, accusing it of allowing access to what Russia calls fake material about the military operation in Ukraine.

Many major Western advertising and social media services have announced new content and payment restrictions around the conflict, including blocking Russian state media RT and Sputnik in the European Union. 
Earlier this month, Google said it had stopped selling all online ads in Russia.

The company reported earnings per share of $3.14 on revenue of $1.16 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com forecasted earnings of $2.94 per share on revenue of $1.1 billion. Revenue increased  39% year-over-year, driven by continued strong consumer demand and pricing increases.

“Winnebago Industries delivered a strong second quarter performance, executing on sustained, elevated consumer demand for our expanded portfolio of premier outdoor lifestyle brands. Our second quarter performance and record sales results at recent RV and Marine trade shows further validate consumers’ embrace of the outdoor lifestyle,"" Winnebago President and CEO Michael Happe commented.

Severstal, whose main shareholder Alexey Mordashov is one of a number of wealthy Russians now sanctioned by the European Union, has until the end of the day to get an already overdue $12.6 million loan 'coupon' payment to its creditors.
A source close to the steel firm said the money had been transferred last week but was yet to be processed and passed on by its paying agent Citibank.
""This will technically be the first default since the crisis began to unfold,"" Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal said.
""But people will know it is driven by the way the sanctions have been formulated, rather than the company's fault,"" adding Severstal might find a way to make the payment in the coming days, especially if Mordashov were to cut or relinquish his large stake in the firm, which itself is not sanctioned. 
With Wednesday's deadline fast approaching Severstal said it had been in constant discussions about the issues, and that it was looking at an application for special ""licences"" that may be required to make the payment.
The legal terms of the bonds state an ""Event of Default"" can be formally declared five working days after the March 16 coupon due date. 
The latest Western sanctions and countersanctions by Moscow mean that transferring payments on Russian government and corporate bonds has become complex.
Previously payments like Severstal's would have been processed by international clearing houses such as Clearstream or Euroclear, which confirm asset ownership, and also funnel payments for domestic bondholders to Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD).
However both Euroclear, owned by a group of global exchanges and banks, and Clearstream, part of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), have said they will stop settling trades in Russian securities as a result of the EU's sanctions.
Neither Clearstream, Euroclear nor  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) responded to requests for comment.
DELAYS POSSIBLE
A Severstal default would be the first by a major Russian company since Moscow was blanketed by sanctions for what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, but it may not be alone.
Russian companies need to make $18.5 billion of international bond payments by year-end, ITI Capital analysts estimate, while Moscow needs to pay another $3.4 billion on its foreign currency sovereign bonds.
Investors would have the right to take legal action to reclaim unpaid amounts, most likely in the United Kingdom or the United States - under whose laws most international market bonds are issued. 
Payments due in coming days include from Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), which made a payment without problems earlier this month, Russian Railways on March 25 and Polyus Gold on March 28, the same day as Russia's next international sovereign bond payment falls due.
It's not just international bondholders who are affected. Severstal, Russia's top steelmaker NLMK, state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders, the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.
NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money, Russian holders hadn't.
""This is due to the fact that... Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia's NSD,"" NLMK said. ""We currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents."" 
NSD confirmed it was receiving payments from Euroclear, but said it will not process these until Euroclear gets clarifications from European regulators.
""After curbs are lifted, payments will be processed...as usual,"" it said.
The daily Kommersant newspaper, citing a source at a large brokerage firm, said some Russian holders of Moscow's sovereign bonds also hadn't received payments. A source at a European-based fund told Reuters it too had not received a sovereign bond payment due on Monday. 
The Russian finance ministry, Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to requests for comment. 

""Delays are possible for payments cleared via international depositories,"" NSD added in a statement to Reuters. 
""This could be linked to 'manual' processing of the orders linked to Russian companies as well as with a need to get clarifications from European regulators"".

LONDON (Reuters) -Nestle is to halt the sale of a wide range of brands in Russia, including KitKat chocolate bars and Nesquik, amid Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's criticism of the world's biggest food company for its continued presence in the country.
The products affected, also including pet food and coffee, make up the ""vast majority of volume and sales"" in Russia, which totalled 1.7 billion Swiss francs ($1.82 billion) in 2021, a Nestle spokesperson said.
The Swiss company had already halted non-essential imports and exports to Russia and had also stopped all advertising and capital investment in the country and said it would donate profits from Russia to Ukrainian relief efforts.
Western companies with a presence in Russia have been trying to provide essential food and medicine while also facing pressure to cut all ties with Moscow.
More than 400 companies have withdrawn from Russia since it invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, leaving behind assets worth hundreds of billions of dollars in aggregate. 
Zelenskiy said Nestle had not done enough to live up to its ""Good Food, Good Life"" slogan by continuing to operate in Russia. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression. 
Nestle, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), are continuing to provide basic items for nutrition and hygiene in Russia, such as milk and diapers. 
French rival Danone on Wednesday said it would continue local production in Russia of essential dairy and infant nutrition products. 
Danone said it had ceased all other imports and exports - including Evian water - and halted all investments, including advertising, brand activations and consumer promotions in Russia. The company also said it was taking no cash, dividends or profits from its Russian business.
Zelenskiy on Wednesday told French lawmakers that French companies must leave the Russian market.
Nestle said it would continue to pay its roughly 7,000 employees in Russia, where it has six factories that make products including ready meals, beverages and pet food.
Nestle also said that it stands with the people of Ukraine and its 5,800 employees in the country. 
Nestle has in the past been criticised by activist groups and governments over issues including bottled-water manufacturing, a decision to stay in South Africa during apartheid, and baby formula marketing.
Before its move Wednesday, Nestle was denounced by Ukrainian politicians as well as hactivist group ""Anonymous"", which also urged a product boycott.
Jaideep Prabhu, a professor of marketing at the University of Cambridge's Judge Business School, told Reuters ""There's a history of protesting against Nestle."" 
""Nestle is much more front and centre than P&G and Unilever when it comes to people knowing that they make their products,"" he said. ""Nestle's logos are very prominent on its products.""

Nestle shares closed down 1.6%.

Cohen, who founded the pet-supply startup Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Inc., is a major investor and activist. His RC Ventures LLC purchased GameStop shares between $96.81 and $108.82 each, bringing his total to just over 9 million shares, according to a securities filing.
“I put my money where my mouth is,” Cohen said in a tweet late Tuesday. 
GameStop shares jumped 10% to $135.61 at 10:14 a.m. in New York. After a 31% increase on Tuesday, the gains so far this week amount to the most since March of last year.
Cohen joined the board of GameStop early last year and became chairman in June with a vision to revive growth at the Grapevine, Texas-based company, which has slowed as players shifted from buying gaming discs to digital downloads. GameStop has also suffered from a combination of supply chain issues and an opaque business strategy, and over the last several years it’s churned through a variety of business concepts with mixed reactions from investors and customers.
But Cohen hasn’t said much publicly since his arrival at GameStop. The market has been waiting to hear more about GameStop’s plans for its NFT marketplace initiative after reports of the project surfaced earlier this year. The company last month announced a partnership with Australian gaming startup Immutable X to establish a fund to provide grants to NFT content creators. In its most recent earnings announcement earlier this month, GameStop said it would provide Immutable with as much as $150 million in IMX tokens if it achieves certain milestones.
GameStop’s shares have swung wildly over the past year as the company became the poster child for the meme stock movement. It has been championed by retail investors who organize in online forums like Reddit and boosted the stock by more than 700% last year. The shares are down 17% so far this year.

DENVER (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operator Tallgrass Energy is looking for growth from international markets and recently hired a business development professional to lead such efforts, the company said on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India has frozen plans to allow local firms to list overseas as it seeks to bolster its own capital markets, government officials and industry sources said, in a blow to foreign funds and stock exchanges seeking to tap into the country's tech boom.
New Delhi's decision marks a sudden reversal in policy after officials said late last year that the new rules for overseas listings would be announced in February.
Three senior government officials with direct knowledge of the decision told Reuters the plan had been put on hold as India believes there is enough depth in local capital markets for firms to raise funds and get good valuations. They declined to be named as the move has not been made public.
India's finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Indian equity markets have boomed as enthusiastic retail investors and a pandemic-induced flood of easy money pushed prices to record highs, encouraging a slew of Indian tech founders to go local with their initial public offerings (IPOs).
More than 60 companies made their market debut in India in 2021 and raised a total of more than $13.7 billion, which was more than the previous three years combined. Like other global markets, Indian stocks have been rattled by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the volatility has delayed IPO plans.
But the outlook for such listings dimmed after digital payments app Paytm, backed by China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Ant and Japan's Softbank (OTC:SFTBY), plunged on its debut in November, raising questions about valuations. Its shares have slumped 75% from its issue price. 
Even before Paytm's rout, U.S. venture capitalists such as Tiger Global and Sequoia Capital had lobbied Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow Indian firms to list abroad to achieve better valuations, Reuters has reported.
A second government official said the overseas listing rules were now in ""limbo"" and both the officials cited the stock market debut of food-delivery giant Zomato, which clocked a high valuation, as contributing to the change of view. 
When Zomato went public on Mumbai's exchange in July, its offer was 38 times oversubscribed and its stock jumped 66%. And Indian cosmetics-to-fashion platform Nykaa surged 96% on its debut, achieving a valuation of nearly $14 billion. 
Both have given up much of those gains in recent months.
Two industry sources briefed by government officials also said they had been told the plan was on hold, which also marks a setback for exchanges in New York and London, which had been vying for a slice of India's rapidly growing start-up economy. 
LOBBYING
Global investors have pushed for India to allow overseas listings, saying foreign markets would give Indian companies better access to liquidity and capital. But such a move, which has been under consideration since at least 2020, has deeply divided Indian policy makers. 
Nationalist group Swadeshi Jagran Manch, the economic wing of the ideological parent of Modi's ruling party, opposed the plan, saying such listings would mean less Indian oversight of domestic firms, while Indian investors would find it more difficult to trade in shares of companies listing abroad.
Despite intense lobbying against the change, India's Revenue Secretary said in August last year that overseas listing rules could be announced by February. 
A source with direct knowledge told Reuters on Wednesday that representatives of Swadeshi Jagran Manch lobbied India's Finance Minister in a closed-door meeting in January to not proceed with the policy announcement. 
Though the group is widely seen as having strong influence on India's policy making, it is not clear if that particular meeting contributed to the government's decision.

One senior industry executive who has lobbied New Delhi to allow foreign listings said its decision could result in pressure for other changes by Indian companies.
""Some (investor) funds may want Indian companies to register outside the country,"" the executive said, adding that such a move could allow them to list overseas more easily.

The metals manufacturing company beat on both revenue and earnings per share forecasts. Revenue for the third quarter was $1.38 billion, an increase of 82% compared to the prior-year quarter, and earnings per share reached $1.13 for the company. 
However, weak margins and steel price volatility has weighed on the stock, with the company's President and CEO Andy Rose saying the business is performing well, but ""steel price volatility is expected to remain a headwind for the company.""
""We delivered solid earnings in the quarter,"" Rose said. ""Steel Processing faced headwinds due to continued steel pricing volatility and choppy but improving automotive demand.""
In addition, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 28 cents a share."

(Reuters) -Nvidia Corp is interested in exploring using  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) for manufacturing its chips, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said on a call with reporters on Wednesday.
""They're interested in us using their foundries. We're very interested in exploring it,"" Huang said. But he added that foundry discussions take a long time as it's about integrating supply chains. 
Early last year, Intel, which was making mostly chips it designed, decided to expand its business into making chips that others design as well, called the foundry business, and has announced several multibillion-dollar projects for new manufacturing centers in the United States and Europe. 
Intel's shares rose as much as 2.5% following Huang's comments. 
Investors have been watching for public commitments by chip design companies to use Intel's chip factories. Last year Intel said Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) would be customers for its foundry business.
Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told Reuters after a U.S. Senate hearing on Wednesday that his company is ""thrilled for their interest in using our foundry capabilities."" He said he had ""no particular timeline."" He confirmed that there were ongoing discussions with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
""I'm sure he's interested in having more options ... and it doesn't cost him anything to say that,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon about Huang's comments. ""But it doesn't tell you anything at all about what it's actually going to look like when they get there."" 
Currently, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. builds the bulk of Nvidia chips and Huang said ""being a foundry at the caliber of a TSMC is not for the faint of heart,"" adding that it requires a change in culture to provide not just processes but service.

Asked about whether he would be concerned about working with a competitor like Intel, Huang said trusting and working with industry partners is key and Nvidia has been partnering with many companies including Intel for a long time. 
""Intel has known our secrets for years,"" he said.

280,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 01:26PM ET</span>",U.S. firms want pending natgas pipeline projects excluded from emissions rules,"(Reuters) - Energy firms said they do not want U.S. federal energy regulators to apply new greenhouse gas emission guidelines to currently pending gas pipeline applications.
On Feb. 17, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) modified its policies to determine whether to approve permits for new gas pipelines to include greenhouse gas emissions, a move analysts said would present hurdles for new energy projects.
The greenhouse gas policy requires any project that would result in 100,000 metric tons per year of greenhouse gas emissions must complete an environmental impact statement, which analysts said was an expensive and time-consuming process.
While the FERC rules have not been finalized, energy data and analytics firm Enverus said in a note on Tuesday that the interim greenhouse gas policy was in place.
The FERC, which has increased its focus on controlling greenhouse gas emissions since U.S. President Joe Biden took office, has said the changes would apply to all new and currently pending gas pipeline applications.
In response, U.S. energy companies  Kinder Morgan  Inc (NYSE:KMI) and Boardwalk Pipeline jointly submitted a letter on March 14 asking FERC to not apply the new review to currently pending projects.
Other energy firms have since supported Kinder/Boardwalk's motion asking FERC to reconsider the regulator's position.
""Retroactively applying new standards to currently pending applications violates basic tenets of fairness and due process - especially since the Interim Policy Statements are moving targets that almost certainly will change,"" Kinder and Boardwalk said in their filing.
Kinder and Boardwalk said FERC's policy would cause developers and investors to delay decisions on new projects at exactly the wrong moment ""as war rages in Europe and our allies seek energy security"" after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Energy companies were not the only ones upset about the new FERC guidelines.

Earlier in March, top U.S. senators from both parties grilled Democratic FERC commissioners for approving the new guidelines, which prompt regulators to consider more environmental, landowner and climate issues when considering new pipelines.
The two Republican Commissioners at FERC opposed the new guidelines.

The top Italian insurer is facing a power struggle over its board composition at a shareholder vote late next month. 
The outgoing board has put forward Donnet for a third term as CEO and nominated Andrea Sironi, a leading international expert in governance and risk management who has served as dean of Milan's Bocconi University, as new chairman.
Those nominees are backed by Generali's major shareholder Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY). 
Italian tycoons Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio who are, respectively, Generali's second- and third-largest investors, are opposing Donnet's reappointment as they challenge the influence of Mediobanca. 
Caltagirone has submitted his own slate of nominees proposing Cirina as CEO, a role that Frenchman Donnet has held since 2016, and Claudio Costamagna, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and former chairman of Italian state investor CDP, as chairman.
Cirina and Costamagna plan to hold a news conference on Friday in Milan. 

Generali told Cirina that all obligations of his contract remain in force, including those related to the protection of confidential company information and compliance with internal policies regarding relations with the media, financial analysts, rating agencies, investors and authorities, it said.
The head of German unit Giovanni Liverani will take over as interim Austria and Central and Eastern Europe (ACEE) regional officer with immediate effect.

MILAN (Reuters) -Saipem core investors Eni and CDP together with a pool of banks are ready to advance 1.5 billion euros of an overall 2 billion euro capital increase to rescue the troubled Italian energy service group, two sources said.
The two investors, tied by a shareholder pact, will stump up in advance most of their share of the planned cash call by injecting more than 600 million euros, one of the sources said.
At the same time Eni, which owns 30.4% of Saipem, will temporarily guarantee a bridge-to-cash call loan provided by a pool of eight banks worth 855 million euros ($941 million).
State-owned trade credit insurer SACE is then expected to step in, at a later date, to guarantee the bridge loan when it has had time to process complex paper work, two sources said.
On Wednesday CDP Chief Executive Dario Scannapieco said he was confident about finding a solution for Saipem.
Saipem shares, which have lost more than 40% since the start of the year, were up 7.4% in late trading.
Saipem stunned investors in January when it downgraded earnings by a billion euros due to a significant deterioration of margins on some contracts, sending its shares tumbling.
In February it said it would cut costs, sell assets and scale back green ambitions to focus more on its core oil and gas business after plunging into the red last year.
It is due to unveil its turnaround plan and rescue package on Friday.
BOARD MEETINGS
The sources said conditions were not right for the capital increase to be carried out at the moment due to market volatility after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding it could be launched after the summer.
The banks providing the bridge loan, that will be repaid when the cash call is launched, are also likely to comprise the consortium for the capital increase, one of the sources said.
Sources said the banks were concerned about taking on too much risk and were seeking guarantees.
The boards of Eni and CDP are due to meet later on Wednesday to clear the package which will then be discussed by the Saipem board on Thursday, the sources said.
Eni and Saipem declined to comment.
According to one of the sources, part of the 1.5 billion euros will be used to meet a 500 million euro bond that matures early April even though Saipem does have liquidity to cover it.
Saipem's remaining bond portfolio comprising four bonds for an overall 2 billion euros will not be refinanced but will be allowed to run to maturities between 2023-2028, the source said.

A revolving credit facility worth 1 billion euros, and due to expire at the end of 2023, could be extinguished early and replaced with an identical line with a three-year maturity, one of the sources said.
But the source added it was still under discussion.($1 = 0.9091 euros)

MILAN/OTTAWA (Reuters) -Stellantis took significant steps in its battery production plans in Europe and North America on Wednesday as carmakers race to meet rising demand for electric vehicles. 
The company said its Automotive Cells Company (ACC) joint venture with Mercedes-Benz and TotalEnergies would build a battery plant in Italy and boost its capacity in Europe.
Separately, South Korea's LG Energy Solution (LGES) said it would invest $1.48 billion to set up a joint venture with Stellantis to produce batteries in Canada. 
The total investment will be more than $4.1 billion, which Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Chamapagne said was the largest ever in the Canadian auto sector. Officials did not immediately say how much the federal and provincial governments were contributing.
The Canadian plant, to be built just across the border from Detroit, aims for an annual production capacity in excess of 45 gigawatt hours (GWh) and will create an estimated 2,500 new jobs in the Windsor area, the companies said. 
The moves are part of a plan by the world's fourth largest carmaker to have five battery plants, two in North America and three in Europe, where it has already announced so-called 'gigafactories' in France and Germany, also being built via ACC. 
They come as rivals also move forward with battery production plans and as the car industry struggles with chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. 
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Wednesday picked a site near Valencia for its planned battery cell plant in Spain, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Tuesday launched a factory in Germany, its first European hub.
ITALIAN, CANADIAN GIGAFACTORIES
ACC said on Wednesday it would convert an existing Stellantis engine plant in the southern Italian town of Termoli into a battery facility as agreed in a March 21 memorandum of understanding with Italian authorities.
The total investment for Termoli would amount to 2.3 billion euros ($2.5 billion), including 370 million euros in public funds, Italy's deputy industry minister said in a statement.
The plant in Canada comes as the country, rich in key materials for EV battery production, has been wooing battery makers to safeguard the future of its car manufacturing industry as the world seeks to cut emissions.
Ontario is geographically close to U.S. automakers in Michigan and Ohio, and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV have all announced plans to make electric vehicles at factories in Ontario.
""This is going to make Windsor the home of Canada's first EV battery manufacturing plant, a plant that will be manufacturing hundreds of thousands of batteries,"" Champagne said. ""It's great news for the entire auto sector in Canada.""
Separately, ACC said it would increase its industrial capacity to at least 120 gigawatt hours (GWh) by 2030, versus an initial target of 48 GWh, and scale up the development and production of next-generation high-performance battery cells and modules. 
The plan will involve an investment of more than 7 billion euros, ACC said, and will include bringing production capacity at its French and German plants to 40 GWh each, from the 24 GWh initially planned.
This suggests the Termoli battery plan would also have a capacity of 40 GWh. Tesla's Berlin plant is aiming for an eventual capacity of 50 GWh.

Presenting its first business plan earlier this month, Stellantis said it aimed to sell 5 million battery electric vehicles a year by 2030. It also increased its planned battery capacity by 140 GWh to approximately 400 GWh, through its five gigafactories and additional supply contracts.

Non-residents will have to wait, though - they will be barred from selling stocks and OFZ rouble bonds until April 1.
Trading in blue chips, including state lenders Sberbank and VTB, energy majors Rosneft and Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), will take place between 0650 and 1100 GMT, with short-selling banned, the central bank said on Wednesday.
Russian stocks last traded on the Moscow Exchange on Feb. 25. The central bank then curbed trading as Western sanctions over events in Ukraine threw markets into turmoil.
Until April 1, foreign investors are allowed to conduct operations to lower their obligations including repo deals and deals with derivative instruments, but not to sell shares or OFZ rouble treasury bonds, the Moscow Exchange said. 
The central bank started to buy OFZ rouble treasury bonds to support the domestic debt market when it reopened on Monday, and the finance ministry said it plans to spend 1 trillion roubles to buy Russian companies' shares.
The limited re-opening by MOEX comes after the SPB Exchange, Russia's second-largest bourse, partially restarted trade in foreign shares on Monday, allowing trading of the 15 most liquid stocks including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
From midday on Wednesday, SPB Exchange allowed securities of another 1,639 foreign companies to be bought and sold by domestic market players, most of whom are Russian residents who use the platform to trade foreign stocks.
Trading and settlement is conducted in U.S. dollars but the funds will remain on the brokerage accounts and cannot be cashed out amid Western sanctions on Russia and capital controls that Moscow has introduced in retaliation, the exchange said.
FALLING INTO A LOSS 
Trading of OFZ government bonds restarted on Monday, with the central buying OFZ papers in an effort to limit volatility. 
Yields on some OFZs, including benchmark 10-year treasury bonds, spiked to almost 20%, or the level of the central bank's benchmark interest rate, on Monday, before settling between 14% and 17% in subsequent days.
Volatility has left some players exposed to losses, according to Univer Capital, a mid-sized Russian brokerage, and which on Monday faced a mandatory sale of OFZs it held on behalf of its clients by Russia's National Clearing Center (NCC).
Artyom Tuzov, executive director in the capital markets department at Univer Capital, said falling OFZ prices, which move inversely to yields, triggered margin calls and a liquidity shortage at the brokerage as a result. 
""NCC has blocked the company's trading limit and... is selling (our OFZ) assets as a result. The trading limit will be unblocked after (mandatory) sale is over,"" Tuzov told Reuters.
NCC was selling OFZs held by Univer Capital at yields of between 17% to 20% versus 15% on average on the market that day, according to an internal Univer Capital memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by Tuzov.
As a result, nearly a hundred of Univer's clients faced combined losses of 174 million roubles ($1.7 million), the memo said.
""All operations by NCC are aimed at limiting systematic risks so issues of a single brokerage do not spill over on the overall market,"" the Moscow Exchange, parent company for NCC, said in a statement.
Unlike banks which are supported by the central bank via repo auctions with trillions of roubles on offer, brokerages have no access to state funds to replenish liquidity, Alexei Timofeyev, head of Russian stock market lobby NAUFOR, said.
""Unfortunately, the repo mechanism for brokerages and which was developed (by the central bank) after 2008 did not come into force which puts brokerages who are not part of larger banking groups in a worse position compared with lenders,"" he said.
Aton and Finam, two other large Russian brokerages, both said they had enough liquidity, yet Finam added that a small number of its clients also faced margin calls after the OFZ market re-opened.
""Margin calls are unavoidable tomorrow (when stock market reopens), the market has drastically changed,"" Timofeyev from NAUFOR said, adding that brokerage firms have tried to prepare by closing down some of their positions. 
Trading on the derivatives market with contracts on Moscow Exchange and individual shares, included on the Moscow Exchange index, will take place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. (0700 to 1100 GMT) in the usual format, the central bank said on Wednesday.

It said the trading regime for subsequent days would be announced at a later date.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Revenue at Chinese social media and gaming giant Tencent grew just 8% in the fourth quarter, the slowest pace since it went public in 2004, reflecting regulatory scrutiny that has hurt both its gaming business and advertising sales.
China has frozen game approvals since August last year and curtailed gaming time for under-18s, part of Beijing's move to strengthen control over its society and industries including technology, after years of unbridled growth. 
This has also led to a slowdown in advertising as businesses have cut spending.
Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY), which gets much of its revenue from gaming and develops games such as 'Honour of Kings' and 'Call of Duty Mobile', said domestic gaming sales grew 1% in the quarter ended Dec. 31.
The restrictions on minors were effective as the total time spent by minors on its games sank 88%, Tencent said, adding that the impact of this factor on revenue growth would ease later in the year.
""As we move into the latter half of 2022 it should cease to impact the revenue growth rate,"" Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell told reporters on a call on Wednesday, referring to the minor-protection measures.
Tencent President Martin Lau said regulators were still supportive of the gaming industry, adding that the company had a ready pipeline of games for when approvals resumed.
The company, which also posted its slowest ever annual revenue growth at 16%, said revenue in its online advertising business fell 13% in the fourth quarter. 
It expects its ad business to resume growth in late 2022 after companies adjust to regulatory requirements. 
Total revenue rose to 144.2 billion yuan ($22.63 billion) in the quarter, below an average of 147.6 billion yuan expected by 17 analysts, Refinitiv data showed. 
Beijing has also issued rules to regulate financial holding companies, directing Tencent peer  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s affiliate Ant to turn itself into a financial holding company with capital restrictions.
Lau, who had previously said that creating a financial holding company would not impact its business, repeated his stance on Wednesday and said Tencent was proactively discussing whether it qualified for such a licence.
STAFF NUMBERS
""Going forward we feel that we'll continue to see new regulations coming in but the incremental ones will be less than the bulk of regulations that happened in the first couple of years,"" Lau said.
He said he expects growth in staff numbers this year to be much slower than in previous years as companies pay more attention to efficiency and costs.
Reuters has reported that Tencent CEO Pony Ma told employees at the end of 2021 that the company should prepare itself for a ""winter"", and that it and Alibaba were preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs combined in one of their biggest rounds of layoffs.
Tencent's stock has lost more than a third of its value in the past 12 months, while Alibaba's has more than halved. 
Still, their shares have rallied in recent days after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said last week that Beijing would roll out support for the economy and keep markets stable.

Tencent said on Wednesday its adjusted profit for the December quarter fell by a fourth to 24.9 billion yuan as costs rose.

The company said it had ended other imports and exports as well as all investments, including advertising and consumer promotions, in Russia, and that it would not take any cash, dividends or profits from its business there. 
Rival Nestle said on Wednesday it would halt sales of several non-essential products including KitKat snacks and Nesquik chocolate mix in Russia, as Western companies face government pressure to shun Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.
Danone said it had condemned the war, which Russia calls a ""special military operation,"" from the start, without ambiguity. 
It said supporting the Russian people and its employees did not mean it supported Moscow's actions, and its first priority would always be the safety of its Ukrainian colleagues.
""We also have a duty of care to our 8,000 colleagues in Russia, to Russian citizens, ordinary people, who rely on us for infant nutrition, medical nutrition, dairy products – essential foods,"" Danone said. 
The firm said it did not expect to make a profit in Russia or pay any related taxes for the foreseeable future, and added if it did make any profits there during the war, it would donate them to humanitarian relief organisations.
Danone said it earned about 5% of its revenues in Russia in 2021 and less than 1% in Ukraine, where it has close to 1,000 staff. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told French lawmakers on Wednesday that French firms, including retailer Auchan, should leave the Russian market.
Auchan, which employs 30,000 staff in Russia, declined to comment.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) -Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam, who transformed the airline into Africa's biggest carrier, said on Wednesday he had resigned to focus on his medical treatment.
In an internal memo to employees seen by Reuters he said he had had health issues for almost a year and had been working from the United States for the past five months and was not able to return to the head office any time soon.
""I am retiring early due to health issues,"" he told Reuters in a text message, echoing the language in the memo which said he would focus on his treatment. 
In his 11 years at the helm, Tewolde grew the carrier from just 33 planes into a fleet of 130 planes operating on local and international routes, and from 3 million passengers to 12 million passengers, pre-COVID, the airline said in a statement.
""Mr. Tewolde led the airline for over a decade with remarkable success reflected in its exceptional performance in all parameters including but not limited to exponential growth from 1 billion USD annual turn-over to $4.5 billion,"" the state-owned carrier said.
""Under his leadership, the airline group has grown by four fold in all measurements.""
The airline confirmed the board had accepted his request for early retirement and said a successor would be announced shortly.
Tewolde led the company through the coronavirus pandemic without bailouts by pivoting to cargo, keeping the company profitable and cash positive.
Tewolde also helped the airline recover from the crash three years ago of flight 302, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX bound for Kenya, killing all 157 passengers and crew.

Tewolde's career saw him win a number of accolades including ""African CEO of the Year"" and ""Best African Business Leader"", according to the Ethiopian Airlines website.
""Tewolde is one of the best performing CEOs of a multinational anywhere in the world. He has more than delivered on every performance matrix,"" said Zemedeneh Negatu, global chairman of Fairfax Africa Fund, a Washington-based investment and transaction advisory firm.

Investing.com -- Vicor Corporation (NASDAQ:VICR) shares tumbled 15% Wednesday after the stock was downgraded by CJS Securities to Market Perform from Outperform.
CJS' price target for the company is also under review with analyst Jonathan Tanwanteng expressing concerns regarding Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
The analyst said Nvidia, which unveiled its next-generation datacenter AI processor, is Vicor's largest customer. 
However, the analyst said images of the new Hopper H100 processor do not show any Vicor parts. However, Tanwanteng acknowledged this could be due to capacity constraints. 
He added that given Nvidia is the company's largest customer, Vicor products could be at risk.
While it is possible Nvidia may be dual sourcing or Vicor may still be sold out due to strong demand, the analyst believes the uncertainty about whether Vicor has been shut out will be an overhang on its shares in the near term."

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has picked a site near Valencia for a planned battery cell plant in Spain, which could include U.S. carmaker Ford as a customer or partner, but the project depends on receiving government funds, it said on Wednesday.
The German carmaker aims to begin series production at the 40 gigawatt-hour (GWh) plant by 2026, meaning construction would need to start this year.
Spain, Europe's largest carmaker after Germany, last week launched a bidding process for around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) - around half in grants - to promote electric vehicle (EV) production, with Volkswagen and its Spanish unit SEAT readying a bid. Winners will be chosen this year.
If it does not receive PERTE funds - as the programme, consisting mostly of European Union pandemic relief funds, is called - the plant ""wouldn't be competitive"" and Volkswagen would look at alternatives, SEAT's chairman Wayne Griffiths told Reuters. 
""The European funds allow us to do a lot of things in Spain that probably would not have been done as early ... it has pulled ahead the decision on electrification for instance by about 10 years,"" he said. 
Volkswagen said it would invest, with suppliers, over 7 billion euros ($7.7 billion) in the plant and in starting EV production at two Spanish factories. 
Automakers are racing to build battery plants to power their growing electric fleets, with a focus among European carmakers on reducing dependence on Asia.
Volkswagen aims to build six large battery factories across Europe by 2030.
The first plant by Northvolt in Sweden, in which Volkswagen holds a 20% stake, will begin production in 2022. A second in Germany will be built by 2025 with China's Gotion High-Tech, in which Volkswagen owns 26%.
Partners for the Spanish plant have not been chosen, but the planned location of Sagunto is close to a Ford production site. 
Asked if Ford could be a customer or have a stake in the plant, SEAT's chairman said both were possibilities. 
A Ford spokesperson in Spain said it was evaluating its European production amid growing demand for EVs and had not decided whether to apply for PERTE aid. 

Ford does not currently make EVs in Valencia. It announced last week seven new electric models for Europe and a battery-assembly site in Germany, deepening an existing partnership with Volkswagen to produce a second EV for the European market based on the German firm's platform.

Severstal, whose main shareholder, Alexey Mordashov, was placed under sanctions by the European Union and Britain in response to the Ukraine crisis, has been struggling to process its Eurobond coupon payment since last week.
Severstal itself is not subject to any sanctions, and Mordashov is not subject to the sanctions in the United States.
However, Citibank did not process a payment Severstal sent last week to cover the coupon on its 2024 loan participation notes (LPN) and the grace period expired on Wednesday, Severstal said in a statement.
Citibank recommended that Severstal ask the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to provide a licence that would allow it to process the payment, a source familiar with situation told Reuters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.

Severstal plans to apply for the licence very soon, the source added.

""We believe making TASS content available on Reuters Connect is not aligned with the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Trust Principles,"" Matthew Keen, interim CEO of Reuters, wrote in an internal memo to staff on Wednesday. 
The Reuters Trust Principles https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html, created in 1941 amid World War Two, commits Reuters to act with integrity, independence and freedom from bias.
In response to a request for comment from Reuters, TASS shared a letter that its CEO Sergei Mikhailov sent to Keen on Wednesday in which he said he was ""extremely sorry to learn of Reuters' decision"" and that he understood it was ""influenced by the current world atmosphere.”
""TASS journalists conduct their work honestly and responsibly. Any unbiased analysis will confirm that the informational work of TASS, as a state news agency, is equitable, objective and sufficiently balanced, with no room for disinformation and propaganda fakes,"" he said.
The Russian news agency has been accused by some Western media and press freedom groups of spreading false claims and propaganda about the war in Ukraine. Since the invasion, tech giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and pay TV services have restricted access to Russia state-owned media RT and Sputnik over concerns about spreading misinformation. RT and Sputnik have called restrictions placed on them by distributors, which include app stores and other social media services, unjustified censorship.
Early in March, photo agency Getty Images cut ties with TASS, according to a Forbes report. 
A Getty spokesperson said by email: ""In order to ensure the integrity of the content we distribute, we require that partners and contributors comply with our Editorial Policy."" 
She added that ""Recent TASS content failed to meet those guidelines and ingestion of their content was suspended. We have notified them of a breach of our agreement and are terminating our relationship."" She declined to specify which content fell short of its guidelines.
The Forbes story said TASS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reuters Connect allowed users, mostly news organizations, to access and share TASS content for a fee. Reuters Connect also offers the content of Reuters News and about 90 third-party providers, including Variety, USA Today and CNBC. 
The Reuters newsroom operates independently of Reuters Connect. 
The TASS partnership with the Reuters Connect platform was struck in 2020. In a June 1 press release that year, Michael Friedenberg, then president of Reuters, said having TASS join Reuters Connect was “building upon our valued partnership.” Mikhailov called the agreement “truly a significant event.”
According to the press release, the TASS partnership with Reuters Connect offered customers ""access to breaking news and exclusive video; videos on the Kremlin and Russian President, Vladimir Putin, as well as feature videos and general news.""

Since the invasion, the partnership has sparked sharp criticism on social media. A Politico story https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/20/reuters-staff-partnership-russian-wire-service-00018779 published on March 20 cited unnamed Reuters journalists saying they were embarrassed by the company's partnership with TASS.

MILAN (Reuters) -Monte dei Paschi di Siena must submit an updated capital plan to the European Central Bank by end March, the Italian bank said in its 2021 annual report, highlighting that the Ukraine crisis could affect its cash needs.
The bank's annual report said the war could prompt a revision of its multi-year strategic plan which currently envisages a 2.5 billion euro ($2.8 billion) capital strengthening.
After Italy's Treasury in October failed to clinch a sale of Monte dei Paschi (MPS) to UniCredit, sources close to the matter had told Reuters the cash raising would likely exceed that amount. One source at the time had put it at 3.5 billion euros.
The bank, which in the meantime has hired restructuring expert Luigi Lovaglio as its new CEO, has said any speculation is premature.
Italy owns 64% of MPS following a 2017 bailout that cost taxpayers 5.4 billion euros, and was due to find a buyer for the bank by the end of 2021.
Lovaglio, who took up his job in February after the Treasury pushed for change at the helm, is conducting a review of MPS' accounts which is expected to play a role in determining its cash needs.
He is likely to unveil his strategy for MPS between June and July, a financial source said, adding that the capital plan the bank will send to the ECB by March 31 would be updated once the CEO has finalised his strategy.
European Union authorities must approve MPS' new strategy before clearing the new cash injection. Italy is also negotiating a new re-privatisation deadline which sources have said will extend beyond 2023.
MPS has fallen behind its restructuring goals agreed with the EU. Now the Ukraine war, which is pushing up energy and raw materials costs, further complicates matters.
Though its direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine is low, MPS said it might suffer if the Italian economy weakened as a result of the war. Loan book quality has always been the bank's Achilles heel.
MPS said the ECB had also requested a three-year plan detailing its strategy for impaired loans by March 31.
The bank reported a fourth-quarter loss, hit by higher loan loss provisions, in contrast to rest of the sector, where loan-loss charges have been shrinking after the worst of the pandemic has passed.
In a challenge for the Treasury and the bank, the proposed share issue will also require private investors to contribute to avoid breaching EU state aid rules.
The European Commission, which is softening state aid rules to help companies cope with the Ukraine crisis, on Wednesday said supportive measures for banks linked to crisis would not trigger so-called burden sharing rules. Burden sharing imposes losses on private investors before taxpayer money can be tapped to help a failing bank.

But a source close to the matter told Reuters Rome did not want to try and use this as a loophole to reduce private participation in MPS' capital increase.

(Reuters) -  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS) raised its full-year core sales and profit forecasts on Wednesday, encouraged by higher prices and strong demand for the Cheerios maker's cereals, snack bars and pet food, sending its shares up as much as 6%.
Consumers sticking to pandemic-driven habits of cooking more at home has boosted sales at packaged food makers, who are also benefiting from price hikes, with General Mills joining peers Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) and Kellogg (NYSE:K) in reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit.
Margins, however, remain pressured across the food industry as pandemic-induced supply chain shortfalls have led to soaring freight and labor expenses, adding on to spiraling costs of packaging material and ingredients.
General Mills had cautioned in February that supply issues in categories including refrigerated dough, pizza and hot snacks in North America would affect shipments in the third quarter, but measures such as securing alternate supply sources helped the company exceed its expectations for organic sales growth, up 4%. 
""Our actions drove a sharper rebound than we expected at the end of the third quarter, and we’re seeing that improvement continue into fourth quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening said.
The company's forecast raise surprised analysts. ""It's not every day in this generally predictable industry that results come in ahead of a late-quarter (February) pre-announcement,"" J.P. Morgan's Ken Goldman said. 
The maker of Betty Crocker cake mixes expects organic net sales to rise by about 5% in fiscal 2022, compared with its prior estimate of a 4%-5% increase.

It forecast adjusted per-share profit between flat and an increase of 2%, compared with its earlier range of a 2% decline to a 1% rise.
General Mills' net sales fell short of estimates, but its adjusted profit of 84 cents per share for the quarter ended Feb. 27, topped market expectations of 78 cents.

The average payout for securities workers in New York in 2021 was $257,500, a figure boosted by the record levels of deal-making and trading activity big banks handled as the global stock markets surged to all-time highs.
""The numbers pop out ... and are higher than what had been projected,"" New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said, calling it ""welcome news."" 
Wall Street contributed about 18% of all the taxes collected in New York for 2021, and it should help New York City beat its expectations for income tax revenue, the report found.
""We have an April 1 budget deadline for the state, and this is welcome news. It gives them a little bit more breathing room,"" DiNapoli said.
A number of factors, including inflation, the ongoing recovery and economic fallout from Russia's invasion in Ukraine, are expected to weigh on Wall Street bonuses this year. New York City and state estimates currently predict that incentive compensation packages for securities industry workers in 2022 will fall by 16% on average.
However, in 2021, the overall bonus pool increased by 21% to $45 billion during the traditional December-March bonus season, compared to $37.1 billion in 2020, according to the report.

The securities industry makes up one-fifth of private sector wages in New York City, despite comprising only 5% of private-sector employment, the report said.

Cresco executives said the combined entity has the potential to be a brand as big as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) or Johnnie Walker as the deal would help it dominate a market likely to reach $46 billion in sales by 2026.
Columbia Care investors will get 0.5579 shares of Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF) for each unit held. Based on Cresco's Tuesday closing price, it represents a nearly 16% premium.
The deal, which was reported by Reuters on Tuesday, values Columbia Care's equity at C$1.36 billion ($1.07 billion). 
The companies together will operate in 18 states, but overlapping footprints in several regions, including in New York, could require significant divestitures before the deal gets regulatory approvals.
Besides New York, Cresco could divest assets in Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, and Florida, using proceeds from the sales to cut debt, Chief Financial Officer Dennis Olis said on a call with analysts.
""The success of this merger will depend largely upon Charlie's (Cresco CEO) ability to execute and integrate at scale while monetizing the redundant assets,"" said Todd Harrison, founder of cannabis investment firm CB1 Capital, which owns shares in Cresco.
Both Cresco and Columbia Care are listed in Canada as marijuana remains illegal at the federal level and the two large U.S. stock exchanges do not allow companies that grow or sell the plant to list their shares.

(Reuters) - Battered technology and growth shares have shrugged off rising bond yields to drive a rebound in world stocks as some investors view them as a hedge to inflation against the backdrop of supply-chain snarls and an intensifying war in Ukraine.
The NYSE FANG+TM index, which includes the five core FAANG stocks - Meta Platforms, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - posted their best six-day performance on Tuesday, rising 22% and far outpacing the S&P 500's 8% rise in the same period.
Growth stocks, which usually underperform as yields rise, surged despite the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield hitting its highest since 2019 on fears of aggressive monetary policy tightening. 
Higher interest rates typically hurt tech and growth stocks as their valuations rely more heavily on future cash flows. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index is down nearly 10% year-to-date, steeper than the 4% decline in the benchmark S&P 500.
""In the face of rising 10-year yield, (investors are) leaving bonds going toward equities, and they are going toward the growth areas that had been beaten up, but I question whether this is going to last,"" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA Research in New York.
Some analysts said the technology stocks are proving to be inflation resistant as their profits are largely immune to rising commodities prices when compared to manufacturing and consumer companies.
""High operational gearing, sticky consumer and global footprint lends itself to some sympathy,"" said Mark Taylor, sales trader at Mirabaud Securities.
Tech giants listed in Hong Kong have surged 36% since last Tuesday's bottom, helped by Beijing's market-friendly concessions last week that buoyed hopes that the worst of the regulatory tightening was over.
Tech stocks in Japan rose for seven straight sessions, while those in Europe have also enjoyed gains. 

""The Chinese market has had a strong rebound,"" Emmanuel Cau, head of equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), said, adding that with the broader market gaining, many funds could reengage with a sector shunned by investors at the start of the year.
Analysts at Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research said a revival in buying activity from retail investors following the Federal Reserve's rate hike last week aided the rebound in stocks.

Investing.com --  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS), the branded foods manufacturer, rallied Wednesday following its earnings report which saw it raise its 2022 guidance.
The maker of Cheerio's and Betty Crocker announced earnings per share of $0.84 on revenue of $4.54 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.78 on revenue of $4.56 billion.
The company also raised its fiscal 2022 outlook, with recent price increases helping to ease cost pressures while demand remains robust.
The news sent General Mills shares more than 5% higher in early Wednesday trading.
Organic net sales for the company are now expected to increase approximately 5% for fiscal 2022, with adjusted earnings per share now expected to range between flat and up 2%, driven by the higher outlook on adjusted operating profit.
“Our solid execution in a highly volatile environment enabled us to close the third quarter with improved momentum,” said General Mills Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Harmening. 
""We expect to drive strong growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by accelerating net price realization. With confidence in our plans and positive momentum on our business, we’re raising our guidance for fiscal 2022.”

TIM, Italy's largest telecoms group, has already received an approach from U.S. fund KKR about a 10.8 billion euro ($11.8 billion) potential offer.
Italian press reported earlier on Wednesday that private equity group CVC was interested in the services arm of TIM once a plan to split the phone group's network from the rest of the business was completed.
""CVC has been analysing for some time a possible scenario of industrial reorganisation at TIM to identify solutions to help the relaunch of the group... no decision has been taken,"" the spokesperson said.
A source confirmed that CVC had been looking at the services business in particular.
TIM said this month that it would start formal talks with KKR almost four months after receiving an initial approach.
In a letter sent last week, TIM sought clarification of KKR's plans for the debt-laden telecoms group and the structure of its offer, sources familiar with the matter said.
""We are expecting a reply from KKR any moment now,"" TIM Chairman Salvatore Rossi said at an event in Rome on Wednesday.

TIM shares traded 1.2% higher at just over 0.30 euros at 1325 GMT, well below the 0.505 euro price at which the KKR approach was pitched.
TIM is also exploring a possible tie-up with state-backed broadband rival Open Fiber as it pursues an internal restructuring under new CEO Pietro Labriola.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Wednesday, running into profit-taking after the strong gains of the last week as the prospects for a long and profound disruption to the world economy from Russia's invasion of Ukraine appeared to become more realistic. 
Overnight, Russia had unilaterally tightened the world oil market by claiming that an export terminal taking Kazakh oil to world markets via the Black Sea had to be closed for up to two months to allow repairs to storm damage. The Caspian Pipeline Consortium's link was due to ship some 1.5 million barrels a day of crude in April, according to Argus Media. 
Additionally, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned Russia that the use of nuclear weapons, which has been mentioned in passing by various official and non-government figures in Russia as a possible course of action, would ""change the nature"" of the Ukraine war. Stoltenberg said Russia must understand it cannot win a nuclear war, and also called on China to stop spreading what he called Russian ""lies and disinformation"" about its actions in Ukraine.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 288 points, or 0.8%, at 34,519 points. The S&P 500 was also down 0.8% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.1%, giving up more than half of its Tuesday gains. 
Crude oil prices surged again on the latest round of back-and-forth, which included Polish preparations to expel 45 Russian diplomats for spying and demand from Vladimir Putin that Europe pay for its Russian oil and gas in rubles. U.S. crude futures rose 4.2% to $113.83 a barrel, while Brent futures topped $120 a barrel for the first time in two weeks. Oil and gas stocks rose in sympathy, with  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rising 1.3%,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rising 2.6% and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rising 3.6%. Occidental is the most highly leveraged of the three and typically reacts more to changes in crude prices as a result.
Stocks catching the eye in early trading included Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock, which fell 8.0% after warning of war-related disruptions to its operations that affected its guidance for the coming quarter. Tencent Holdings ADRs (OTC:TCEHY) also fell 7.6% after the Chinese Internet giant recorded its slowest-ever quarterly sales growth, reviving fears that the regulatory crackdown in China has permanently changed the long-term outlook, despite promises of relief from vice-premier Liu He last week. 
Elsewhere,  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) stock rose 4.7% after the maker of Cheerios raised its forecasts for profit and revenue this year, a signal that it is comfortable with passing on higher input prices to consumers. GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock rose 12.1% after disclosures that chairman Ryan Cohen had bought another 100,000 shares. Cohen's involvement with the videogames retailer has been a central pillar of the narrative that has fired retail investors' imaginations over the last year.  
Sentiment was also hurt at the margins by signs that rising long-term interest rates are starting to cool the housing market. New home sales fell surprisingly for the second month in a row in February, while the Mortgage Brokers Association said that mortgage applications fell by over 8% last week, as the benchmark 30-year mortgage rate soared to 4.50%. It's now risen 150 basis points in the last seven months. "

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Germany's EnBW will avoid any new energy supply deals with Russia for as long as Vladimir Putin is its president, the utility's chief executive said in response to Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.
""There won't be any new supply contracts with Russia under this leadership,"" Frank Mastiaux told journalists at the group's annual press conference, four weeks after the war on Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", began.
EnBW, Germany's No.3 energy company by market value, has stepped up efforts to cut Russian coal and gas supplies but said it could not make up for a sudden halt to imports - chiming with larger rivals RWE and E.ON.
""As you know, completely replacing procurement in the short term in the event of a theoretical loss of Russian gas is not feasible for us, as it is for most market participants,"" Mastiaux said after presenting full-year results.
""Germany will continue to rely on gas imports for some time to come,"" Mastiaux said, adding he welcomed economy minister Robert Habeck's efforts to seek liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.
EnBW received 3.6 million tonnes, or 86%, of its hard coal supply from Russia, he said, adding it started to diversify procurement at the end of 2021, and existing stockpiles will ensure supply well into the current year.

Turning to gas, which includes the group's VNG division, EnBW said that 20% of the 495 terawatt hours (TWh) it procured last year came via direct agreements with Russian suppliers, adding those volumes would decrease from 2023 onwards.
EnBW finance chief Thomas Kusterer said VNG had two direct contracts with Russian suppliers, one of which - with a volume of 35 TWh - was due to expire at the end of 2022, while another 65 TWh contract runs until 2030.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean battery giant LG Energy Solution Ltd (LGES) said on Wednesday it plans to invest $1.5 billion to set up a joint venture with Stellantis NV in Canada.
LGES owns 51% of the joint venture, tentatively named ""LGES-STLA JV"" and Stellantis owns 49%, LGES said in a regulatory filing. 
The South Korean battery maker added that its board approved a guarantee of debt regarding its joint venture with Stellantis, which stands at $627 million. 
In October, LGES and Stellantis NV struck an electric vehicle (EV) battery production joint venture, targeting to start production by the first quarter of 2024 and aiming to have an annual production capacity of 40 gigawatt hours of batteries.
In a separate regulatory filing, LGES said it plans to acquire a stake worth $542 million in ES America to respond to demand from EV startups in the United States. 
LGES is considering building a factory in Arizona to meet demand in the United States, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, adding that the plant is expected to primarily produce cylindrical battery cells. LGES has its own factory in Michigan and two battery joint ventures with General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) in Ohio and Tennessee. 
""We are considering a new production site, but nothing has been decided yet,"" said a spokesperson at LGES. 
LGES, which counts Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, GM and Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) among its customers, currently has battery production sites in the United States, China, Poland, Indonesia and South Korea.

311,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 09:27AM ET</span>",Amazon Is Back to Acting Like a Wall Street Darling,"(Bloomberg) -- After almost two years of lagging behind the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is starting to behave more like one would expect from Wall Street’s favorite megacap stock.
The shares have rallied 21% since hitting a 20-month low on March 8, the day before the e-commerce giant announced a stock split and buyback plan that sparked the turnaround. Amazon is now on the verge of turning positive in a year in which the Nasdaq 100 Index is still down 10%, making it the best-performing of the four largest U.S. technology companies in 2022.
The recent rally is a welcome development for analysts, who have remained universally bullish as the shares labored. All 57 tracked by Bloomberg data have a buy or equivalent recommendation on the stock, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Bank of America Corp touting it as a top pick.
Those predictions are now, perhaps, proving prescient: while Amazon is now down just 1.1% for the year, Alphabet has declined 3.4%, Apple has slumped almost 5% and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) is 9.6% lower.
To Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, Amazon’s recent gains have a lot to do with the stock split and buybacks -- which are clear signals the company is becoming more shareholder friendly.
“The stock split was huge,” Morgan said in an interview. “It looks like some money is swinging back into Amazon because of that perceived shift.”
The potential for returning more capital to shareholders was cited by Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC, which said last month it significantly boosted its stake in the company. Loeb told investors in February that Amazon was undervalued to the tune of about $1 trillion due to the combination of its different e-commerce and web services businesses, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Still Expensive
Amazon’s rally comes as investors start to embrace higher-valuation stocks again, after months of shunning them in favor of cheaper ones in anticipation of Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes. Like the Nasdaq 100, the shares are still trading well off their high, down 12% from a July record.
While Amazon is much cheaper than it once was, the stock is still priced at 45 times profits projected over the next 12 months, making it by far the most expensive of the megacaps. The average for the Nasdaq 100, by contrast, is 25 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
While the shares may be benefiting from the split and buybacks, Amazon’s businesses will need to continue performing well for the rally to last, according to Michael Casper, an equity strategist with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Those things tend to be a short-term boost and fundamental trends will ultimately carry the day,” Casper said.
Tech Chart of the Day
U.S. technology stocks are flashing a bullish signal little more than a week after the sector entered a bear market. The Nasdaq 100 Index closed above its 50-day moving average on Tuesday for the first time since Jan. 4. The move comes after the tech-heavy gauge climbed for a fifth session in six, adding 12% since hitting a 10-month low on March 14. A break above the closely watched technical level has spurred multiple prolonged rallies, including late last year when the gauge hit a record high.

As part of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc.’s $10 billion investment in the oil company in 2019, Buffett has the option to acquire 83.86 million shares at $59.62 each, a level that the stock has closed above the past two days. Exercising those warrants could give Berkshire a nearly 23.6% stake in the oil company, in addition to its preferred stock. Buffett’s firm is already Occidental’s biggest shareholder.
“He does have a very good track record of lending out money in times of duress for the recipient, for the borrower, and procuring these warrants,” said Darren Pollock, whose Cheviot Value Management LLC oversees investments including Berkshire shares. “Over time when those businesses do well, he does have this added kicker of so many additional warrants that are worth so much over time.”
Buffett declined to comment when asked if Berkshire would exercise the warrants.
Occidental stock was up 3.1% to $61.50 at 8:46 a.m. before the start of regular trading in New York.
Occidental is the top performer in the S&P 500 Index this year, gaining nearly 106% at the close of trading on March 22. Rising oil prices helped the Houston-based company pay down debt more rapidly than expected, raise its dividend and restart a share-buyback program. Sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine also boosted investor appetite for U.S. shale-focused oil stocks.
The revival brought an end to a tough three years for the company, which saddled itself with debt in the 2019 purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). for $37 billion, just months before Covid-19 caused oil prices to collapse.
Berkshire’s preferred-stock bet on Occidental provided part of the funding for the Anadarko deal. Buffett has also been plowing money into Occidental in recent weeks, accumulating a stake that now ranks among Berkshire’s top 10 common-stock holdings.

313,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 09:06AM ET</span>",Options mavens see stock rebound as chance to pick up downside protection,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Risk appetite has rebounded on Wall Street after a brutal start to the year, but some strategists warn the lull in volatility may be brief and urge investors to guard against more stock market gyrations.
The Cboe Volatility Index - an options-based measure of expected 30-day volatility for U.S. stocks that some call Wall Street's fear gauge - fell to a five-week low of 22.81 on Tuesday, just two weeks after closing at a one-year high.
The move has coincided with a rally in the S&P 500 index, which has halved its year-to-date losses, fueled in part by the Fed's assurances that the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand more aggressive monetary policy tightening as the central bank fights to tamp down surging inflation. The index is still down about 5% for the year after confirming a correction last month. 
Some options strategists say the recent gains could be fleeting and are advising clients to buy hedges against volatility, which have become cheaper in recent days as demand for portfolio protection has ebbed. 
Catalysts for future volatility eruptions range from worries that the Fed's hawkish tilt will drag the economy into recession – an idea that is roiling bond markets – to further geopolitical uncertainty stemming from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation.""
""With no demand for buying protection, the VIX is going to have a tendency to soften ... but as we saw in mid-February, that can change in a heartbeat,"" said Matthew Tym, head of equity derivatives trading at Cantor Fitzgerald. ""If I see the VIX down another point or two, I am starting to think that's bottoming out."" 
That sentiment was echoed by strategists at BoFA Global Research, who believe worries about high inflation, slowing growth and a hawkish Fed are likely to fuel more stock market weakness.
""We see the risk-on price action and lower cost of protection not as a rallying cry, but rather an opportunity to reload on hedges,"" they wrote in a note on Tuesday. 
An S&P 500 put option that would guard against a 10% decline in the index through mid-June costs about 30% less now than a week ago, Refinitiv data showed.
Meanwhile, the one-month moving average of open put contracts against open calls on the SPX index, a measure of defensive positioning, is at its lowest since July 2020, according to Trade Alert data.
Intense volatility prompted some investors to lower exposure to stocks in recent weeks, one possible reason why demand for hedges has fallen.
A BofA Global Research survey for March showed fund manager's cash levels at their highest since April 2020, while a measure of equity positioning tracked by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) recently slipped to the lowest since September 2020.
""There is just less exposure to hedge,"" said Ilya Feygin, senior strategist at WallachBeth Capital.
To be sure, analysts have also noted that sharp drops in the VIX have often preceded short-term upside in stocks: the S&P 500 has historically returned 2.5% and been up 77% of the time following a five-day drop in the VIX, wrote Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group.
Others, however, point out that the VIX has only closed below its media average of 18 three times this year and believe it is unlikely to settle down soon. 

The VIX curve remains quite flat all the way through November, suggesting traders expect markets to stay choppy throughout most of the year. 
""It points to volatility remaining around where it is now for a while,"" said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.

His estimates come in the light of today's appearance of CEOs of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), and Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) in front of a US Senate Committee.
The hearing is expected to focus on the domestic semiconductor supply chain, R&D, competitiveness, etc.
Arya warns that government funding could help but it is not a silver bullet.
We are skeptical that enhanced subsidies could address these concerns anytime soon. Neither Intel nor Micron are technologically/strategically equipped to address these issues. Near-term shortages are in trailing edge chips for auto/industrial applications, not in PC/server processors (Intel) or memory (Micron). Building a credible alternative to Taiwan (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM)) requires a dedicated foundry with tech/scale/experience/business strategy which we don't believe any US foundry is equipped for, the analyst said in a client note.
Along these lines, Arya lists stocks that could benefit the most from the direct subsidies. Intel is seen as the biggest beneficiary, but Arya says that some of this funding is already embedded in the company's outlook.
Instead, investors should focus on these semi stocks:
1) GlobalFoundries (GFS): focused US-headquartered foundry, any new US funding incremental to street FCF estimates, and a key part of addressing supply shortages in auto markets (we note recent relationships with Ford, BMW etc. to secure capacity);
2) Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN): boosted capex for US-based trailing edge analog/embedded fabs, any subsidy could help boost FCF; and
3) Semicap equipment vendors (KLAC, AMAT, LRCX and others) who benefit from investments in new manufacturing capacity.
The analyst also says the US government might also need to speak to Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) to reconsider its western manufacturing plans.

The company's CEO Jensen Huang presented a new GPU, as well as discussed the latest AI and Omniverse developments.
Below we share key insights from 6 Nvidia analysts who attended the event:
Rosenblatt's Hans Mosesmann (Buy, $400): We see Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at heightened risk (both on the GPU and CPU fronts) and supportive of AMD, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) roadmaps that incorporate a pace of innovation that should keep up with Nvidia (sans the software angle, which is Nvidias secret sauce).
BofA's Vivek Arya (Buy, $375): Maintain Buy and top sector pick following analyst day where management outlined a nearly $1Tn addressable opportunity across AI hardware, Gaming, Enterprise/Metaverse software, robotics and autos, including a 3x of core data center TAM to $300bn (vs prior analyst day).
Raymond James' Chris Caso (Strong Buy): While the stock is among the most highly valued at 40x, that multiple is justified by 50% annual revenue growth for the last two years (35% annually over the last 5), and such significant product cycles and new revenue streams going forward.
Goldman Sachs' Toshiya Hari (Neutral, $245): We came away from the event with a better appreciation of Nvidias long-term growth opportunity (note managements long-term TAM estimation of $1 trillion) as well as its robust competitive position We are Neutral-rated on the stock given potential risk/reward relative to others in our coverage universe; however, we would look to turn more constructive if/when presented with a better entry point or a normalization in Gaming segment revenue.
JPMorgan's Harlan Sur (Overweight, $350): With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/CPU), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, NVIDIA is well-positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view. Bottom line: NVIDIA continues to be 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors.
Barclays' Blayne Curtis (Overweight, $350): There was no update to guidance but trends do seem to remain strong with the company targeting the remainder of its $5B in buybacks into the end of the year. NVDA remains one of our favorite names with leverage to the Data Center, Auto finally inflecting in 2H, and the most additional drivers of any name in our universe.

Through his holding company Inversora de Carso, the billionaire also controls real estate developer Realia. 
Metrovacesa shares jumped 16% on Wednesday morning to 7.51 euros, just below the 7.8 euros offered by FCC. 
The offer price represents a 20% premium over Tuesday's closing price, Spanish lender Bankinter said in a note to clients. Shares in Metrovacesa's rivals may also rise on Slim's move, Bankinter added. 
Santander and BBVA, which together own about 70% of Metrovacesa according to Refinitiv Eikon data, are unlikely to sell at 7.8 euros, JBCapital analyst David Gandoy said in a report.
""Consequently, we see this partial bid as a financial investment aimed at taking advantage of the current market conditions,"" he added. 
""As we always do, we will analyse the offer and decide what is best for our shareholders,"" a BBVA spokesperson said, adding the offer price was in line with the valuation on the bank's books.

Santander declined to comment.

Aegon had announced the 830 million euro sale of its Central and Eastern European insurance, pension, and asset management businesses to VIG in 2020, but the Hungarian government initially blocked the deal.
Late last year, however, the country's finance ministry said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with VIG that could enable it to take a 45% stake in the two companies' local unit, and the European Commission later ordered Hungary to withdraw its veto.
Right-wing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly said Hungarian companies or the state must hold majority stakes in sectors including finance, energy, media and trade.
Aegon, which plans complete the sales of its Polish, Romanian and Turkish businesses this year, said in a statement the sale was an important step towards narrowing its strategic focus and bolstering its balance sheet.
The group said the cash boost would help it to lower its debt, and announced a 375 million euro repayment tender offer as well as a 300 million euro share buyback from April to December.

Following the debt tender offer, Aegon expects to have reduced its gross financial leverage to 5-5.5 billion euros.

Lanvin Group, which manages iconic brands such as Lanvin, Sergio Rossi, Wolford, St. John Knits, and Caruso, has agreed to combine with a U.S.-listed 'blank cheque company' affiliated to Primavera Capital Group, an investment firm founded by former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Greater China Chairman Fred Hu. 
""We plan to accelerate the growth of our portfolio via both organic development and disciplined acquisitions,"" Joann Cheng, chair and CEO of Lanvin Group, said in a joint statement with Primavera Capital Acquisition Corporation (PCAC).
The announcement came less than two weeks after U.S. regulators named five New York-listed Chinese companies that face delisting risks, and shows that some Chinese companies are undeterred by the long-running auditing dispute between Beijing and Washington.
The planned transaction, which values Shanghai-based Lanvin Group at a combined equity value of up to $1.9 billion, may also face scrutiny by Chinese regulators, who are tightening supervision over offshore listings.
Cheng brushed aside such concerns during a video conference on Wednesday, saying Lanvin Group owns a global brand portfolio and a diverse investor base.
The group, which operates in over 80 countries with more than 300 retail stores, expects to open over 200 new stores by 2025, seeking to capture growth opportunities in North America and Asia, beyond its stronghold in Europe. 
SPAC 
SPACs are shell firms that raise money from institutional and retail investors via market listings, and put it in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
Wall Street's frenzied blank-check deals have slowed in the past year but some Chinese companies still see it as a short cut to accessing U.S. capital markets. 
Ronald Shuang, chairman of boutique investment company Balloch Holding Group, said many Chinese companies remain keen to list in the U.S., despite geopolitical tensions.
""If you list on the Nasdaq, or the New York Stock Exchange, you have access to the world's most liquid market, and strong capital backing,"" said Shuang, whose firm has sponsored several U.S.-listed SPACs with a focus on China assets.
Lanvin Group was formerly known as Fosun Fashion Group before it adopted the name of the French luxury label. It said it aims to raise a total of $544 million through the proposed combination with the Primavera SPAC. 

That includes up to $414 million of cash in the trust account, and fully committed subscriptions and forward purchase agreements worth $130 million from investors including Fosun International, ITOCHU Corp and Stella International Ltd. 
Max Chen, Partner of Primavera, said: ""Lanvin Group and Primavera share the same vision of nurturing and reinvigorating world-class luxury brands.""

LONDON (Reuters) - BP (NYSE:BP) is seeking buyers for its shut-down Foinaven oilfield in the North Sea, hoping Britain's renewed focus on domestic production will attract buyers interested in extracting the field's remaining reserves, industry sources said.
BP halted production at the Foinaven field west of the Shetland islands last year after 25 years of activity and is preparing to dismantle its floating production vessel.
The field nevertheless still holds reserves of around 200 million barrels of oil which could be tapped in a relatively short time and with minimal investment, the three sources said.
The sale is part of a gradual retreat of BP and other big producers from the ageing basin in recent years, selling assets to smaller companies that specialize in extending late-life fields.
It is unclear how much money BP could get from the Foinaven field, if any, given the clean-up, or decommissioning, costs that would have to be negotiated, the sources said.

But following the recent sharp rally in oil and gas prices and Europe's efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian energy in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, BP hopes the field could attract buyers, the sources said.[O/R]
A BP spokesperson declined to comment. The London-based company holds 100% interest in the field after acquiring a 28% stake from Viaro Energy last year.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -Cash-strapped Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd has joined a growing list of Chinese property developers unable to publish 2021 audited earnings by March 31 as required by listing rules, deepening market concern about the sector's financial health.
Kaisa late on Tuesday said a virus lockdown in Shenzhen left audit work incomplete so it cannot publish financial results on time. In a filing, it said trading of its shares in Hong Kong will therefore be suspended from April 1 as per bourse rules.
Its stock price dropped 2.7% in Wednesday morning trade versus a 1.7% rise in the benchmark Hang Seng Index.
Bigger peer China Evergrande Group, the world's most-indebted property developer, also on Tuesday said it would not be able to publish results on time due to a large number of additional audit procedures resulting from ""drastic changes"" in operations since the second half of 2021.
Trading of shares in Evergrande and two Hong Kong-listed subsidiaries has been suspended since Monday.
Other major developers including Sunac China Holdings Ltd and Shimao Group Holdings Ltd also this week said they will delay reporting audited results due to disruption caused by COVID-19, but that they will produce unaudited results on March 31 to keep their shares trading.
However, some have delayed results due to changing auditors. Ronshine China Holdings Ltd on Monday said auditor PwC had quit due to insufficient time to complete auditing work.
Analysts said failure for companies to issue timely 2021 results will further weigh on sector sentiment, which has been hit in the past few months by liquidity concern.
""We think auditors' more stringent checks on project booking/debt might also have played a role,"" JP Morgan said in a report, referring to the delay.
The U.S. investment bank said it would not be surprised to see more delays because, even for companies that have announced board meeting dates, there is still the possibility of results delays if auditing processes cannot be completed by then.
Nomura said it typically raises red flags when companies change auditors ahead of earnings announcements, and that such a practice causes serious market concern about trustworthiness.
Kaisa, the second-largest U.S. dollar bond issuer among Chinese property developers after China Evergrande, is restructuring its $12 billion offshore debt after defaulting on some bonds last year.

In Tuesday's filing, Kaisa said it has been working with legal and financial advisors in recent months to formulate a solution ""for the benefit of all stakeholders"" and to ease liquidity issues.
Kaisa also said it has entered ""constructive dialogue"" with creditors. It has been in talks with bondholders over a debt restructuring deal since late last year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU companies affected by sanctions imposed on Russia can get up to 400,000 euros ($440,360) in state support and compensation up to 30% of energy costs under looser EU state aid rules, the European Commission said on Wednesday.
From airlines to carmakers to tourism businesses, thousands of companies across the 27-country bloc have reported severe disruption due to the sanctions.
Companies in the agriculture, fisheries, aquaculture sectors can get up to 35,000 euros while businesses facing a liquidity crunch can get state guarantees on loans, subsidised loans. 
The Commission did not specify which sectors would qualify for the larger support. 
Companies facing soaring energy costs can get state aid up to 30% of costs, capped at 2 million euros, the Commission said, confirming a Reuters story on Tuesday.
This measure will benefit manufacturers of aluminum and other metals, glass fibers, pulp, fertiliser, hydrogen and other basic chemicals.
""These sanctions also take a toll on the European economy and will continue to do so in the coming months. We need to mitigate the economic impact of this war and to support severely impacted companies and sectors,"" Commission Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The looser rules will be effective until the end of the year. Sanctioned Russian-controlled entities are not eligible for such aid.

The EU executive, which also acts as the bloc's competition enforcer, relaxed its state aid rules two years ago, allowing governments to pump trillions of euros into companies hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Banks in Asia are ""falling short"" when it comes to meeting global pledges to tackle climate change and aligning with the decarbonisation aims of their countries, according to a study published on Wednesday.
Nearly 200 countries signed a pact in Glasgow last year calling on banks and financial institutions across the world to mobilise more finance to help achieve global climate goals and to seek innovative ways to pay for climate adaptation.
But a review of 32 banks throughout East and Southeast Asia showed that none had made any clear commitments or adequate implementation plans to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, according to Asia Research & Engagement (ARE), a Singapore-based environment group.
""Asia's banks are falling short in aligning with national decarbonisation policies and are not yet taking the steps necessary to meet global climate goals,"" ARE said.
The banks have been quick to launch green financial products but they have lagged when it comes to cleaning up their existing products and carrying out policies required to divert capital away from carbon-intensive industries, it said.
""This raises concerns of greenwashing: that banks are seeking a marketing benefit for sustainable finance deals while providing higher levels of finance to dirty industries,"" the report said. 
Of the 32 banks in major economies like China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia, only nine had long-term net-zero commitments for the emissions they finance, while only 13 had policies prohibiting the financing of new coal-fired power.
The highest ranked Asian bank was DBS Group (OTC:DBSDY) in Singapore, which has set a long-term net-zero target but has not yet made any clear short- and medium-term plans, and also had a number of gaps in its financing policies.
In an emailed statement, a DBS spokesman said the bank had become the first from Singapore to sign up to the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, which commits it to become net-zero by 2050. He said the bank's plans to achieve the goal were included in its sustainability report published this month. 
Five banks were given the lowest rating because they had ""barely started"" their journey towards climate readiness, including China's Bank of Ningbo, Ping An Bank and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPDB).
SPDB said in an emailed statement that it will ""fully serve"" all elements of the carbon-neutral industrial chain and support sectors like green manufacturing and new energy vehicles, adding that green development was part of its ""corporate DNA"".
Ping An said it had already ""upgraded green finance to a strategic level"". The company's green credit balance reached almost 70 billion yuan ($10.99 billion) in 2021, tripling from a year earlier, it said in an email. 
The Bank of Ningbo declined to comment.

ARE said banks needed to establish clear climate policies that were aligned with national goals in order to avoid future regulatory risks and ensure their clients transition to cleaner and more competitive technologies.

335,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 06:31AM ET</span>",U.S. bank profits could be hit by Russia-linked asset swings,"By David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Swings in asset prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine could hit first-quarter profits at big U.S. banks depending on what happens before the end of the month and how markets react, analysts said. 
Trading losses, provisions for expected loan losses, writedowns of assets and charges for closing businesses could muddy what was expected to be an OK quarter as banks benefited from higher interest rates and more lending even as the flood of investment banking revenue subsided.
Big banks could take one-time hits totaling $5 billion, or twice that, or none at all, said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. 
""You really can't say because markets are moving in such a volatile fashion depending on what's going on with the geopolitical risks,"" he said.
The market volatility has been the bad kind for securities dealers, with prices jerking up and down rather than moving steadily as can happen when interest rates are expected to rise or fall, analysts say. 
""The next two weeks could make or break near-term results,"" analyst Jason Goldberg of  Barclays  (LON:BARC) wrote on Friday.
Large U.S. banks start reporting earnings on April 13.
Goldberg cited comments by the markets chief for JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on March 8 that quarterly revenue had become unpredictable because of ""significant counterparty risk"" and ""a lot of clients"" being under extreme stress, particularly from commodities trades.
Those risks were cited on Friday by bond-rating firm Standard & Poor's in a report on the potential impact of the conflict. S&P also warned of new operational problems in complying with sanctions and increased cyber risk.
So far,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) stands out most as likely to report a significant hit. Apart from market exposures, its consumer bank in Russia could cause losses.
CITI BUYBACK PLANS UNDER THREAT
Citigroup said on March 2 that in ""a severe stress scenario"" it could be exposed to nearly $5 billion of losses from its Russian businesses.
The bank has enough excess capital to handle that without serious damage, analysts said. But a hit could slow its share buybacks - a key part of Chief Executive Jane Fraser's plan to lift the bank's valuation. 
Citigroup's shares trade for less than the company's net worth and re-purchasing them would add value.
The fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation"", and subsequent sanctions, has intensified since the bank first guided on potential losses.
Whether events point to a $2 billion or $4 billion hit for Citigroup in the first quarter or a different sum spread over the year is impossible to determine, analysts said.
""The hard part for us with Citi right now - and it's probably difficult for them, too - is how big of a writedown is needed,"" said Cassidy. ""Writedowns are coming. We just don't know yet how severe.""
Analysts were expecting Citi to earn $13.7 billion this year, according to data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S, so Citigroup should still be profitable this year even with a $5 billion charge. 
Few analysts have updated their estimates for Citigroup since March 4. Many may hold back estimates for big banks until the quarter ends.
By then markets may have turned and more banks may have disclosed consequences of the war and sanctions.

Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp said on Thursday that pulling out of Russia would cost it $100 million in lost revenue in the first quarter. Depending on the final accounting, that could reduce its earnings by 10% from current estimates, according to Barclays' Goldberg.
Some analysts did not want to be quoted about changes they will make to their first-quarter estimates. ""We will have to plug in some number for what provisions will be,"" one said.

Additionally, Adobe reduced ARR by an additional $12 million for its Digital Media services in Ukraine while it will continue to operate in this country.
These actions result in a total ARR cut of $87 million and an expected revenue impact of $75 million for fiscal year 2022, the company added.
Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan lowered the price target on Adobe to $605.00 per share from $700.00. The analyst believes the company can still double its revenues in the long-term to potentially enter the top ranks of software companies to reach $40bn+ of revenues.
He shares four reasons why he remains positive on ADBE stock.
Stifel analyst Parker Lane has maintained a Buy rating and $600.00 target price on ADBE shares following a beat quarter.
We believe ADBE is well positioned for continued penetration of its TAM and can effectively navigate these near-term headwinds, Lane said in a client note.
Similarly, BMO analyst Keith Bachman sees Adobe stock as attractively valued, particularly relative to our expectations for mid-teens FY23 growth.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 06:16AM ET</span>","China's Geely Automobile flags costs, chip shortage after 12% drop in 2021 profit","SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd expects rising raw material prices and global chip shortages to pressure its profitability and sales this year, the Chinese company said on Wednesday, after reporting a 12% fall in 2021 profit.
The world's highest-profile Chinese automaker, thanks to its investments in Volvo Cars and  Daimler  AG (DE:MBGn), reported a 2021 profit of 4.85 billion yuan ($761.64 million), compared with 5.53 billion yuan in the previous year. Revenue rose 10% to 101.6 billion yuan. 
""The intensified competition in China, the rise in raw material prices, other pandemic-related disruptions and global shortages of chip supply have showed no signs of subsiding and should continue to put pressure on the sales performance and profitability of the Group in 2022,"" Geely Automobile said in a statement.
Geely Automobile is targeting to sell 24% more vehicles this year, at 1.65 million vehicles, saying it would look to further expand its export sales to new markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East and western Europe. 
The company also recommended payment of a final dividend of HK$0.21 per ordinary share. 
China's auto sales grew last year, helped by surging sales of new energy vehicles, but industry executives have warned about the impact of a global shortage of semiconductors and rising raw material prices, which have been exacerbated by supply chain disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"".

In an earnings call on Wednesday, Geely Auto Group CEO Jerry Gan said the company's reliance on custom chips and globalised supply chains meant the semiconductor shortage had a ""quite large effect"" on production, an issue Geely would tackle via localisation and in-house chip development, among other measures.

LONDON (Reuters) -ING Groep NV will no longer finance new oil and gas projects, its energy chief said, becoming the biggest bank yet to commit to such a step in the fight against climate change.
The move by the Dutch financial services firm raises pressure on peers to heed a call by the International Energy Agency (IEA) for a halt to funding for new fossil fuel projects to help cap global warming at no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Michiel de Haan told Reuters that ING would not finance projects approved after Dec. 31, 2021 but would still fund energy firms, although ING is already phasing down financing to the oil and gas industry and scaling up lending for renewables.
De Haan said the bank would target a 50% increase in lending for renewable energy by 2025, building on strong growth in 2021, when financing grew 26% to 7.3 billion euros ($8.05 billion).
ING's plan to reduce funding for existing oil and gas clients and projects is more gradual, with a target to cut it by 12% to about 3.5 billion euros by 2025.
""Decarbonisation of the energy system ... is of almost existential importance, but so is affordable energy and reliable supply of energy,"" de Haan said.
""We can make the decision to discontinue our involvement in new greenfields, but we (will) continue our existing involvement in oil and gas across the world because we need to meet those other two targets.""
Lucie Pinson, executive director at NGO Reclaim Finance, said ING was the biggest bank after Crédit Mutuel to introduce such a policy on project finance, but while it was a ""great signal"" to the market, it did not go far enough.
Specifically, banks needed to rein in all other finance to the sector more quickly and be prepared to drop companies planning to expand production, something so far only French public lender Banque Postale has committed to https://oilgaspolicytracker.org.
""ING's commitment to reduce its funding to the overall sector without committing to quickly exclude companies opening new oil and gas fields does not augur well for our climate,"" she said.
Investor pressure on banks to act faster on climate change has increased in the year since the IEA published its report on ending fossil fuel funding.
But many banks have only promised to stop lending in narrow circumstances, such as for drilling in the Arctic. The Ukraine crisis may further hamper the shift, as Europe seeks alternatives to Russian oil and gas.
""It's important to recognise that the IEA also indicates that in the future, oil and gas will be needed,"" de Haan said, adding that the bank was seeking to help customers decarbonise their businesses.
ShareAction, an organisation pushing for responsible investment, said in a February report that 25 of Europe's leading banks had provided $55 billion in funding in 2021 for energy companies planning to expand oil and gas production.

It said HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) were among the biggest funders of oil and gas projects in 2021.

The deal, sealed on Tuesday evening, comes as inflation in Germany hovers above 5% and after Deutsche paid its chief executive officer 20% more in 2021 to reward him for the bank's most profitable year in a decade.
Under the deal's terms, workers get a 3.1% pay increase from June 1 and a further increase of 2.1% from February 2023, the Verdi union and Deutsche Bank said. The deal also includes 750-euro ($826) payments in May and January.
The union had asked for a 6% wage increase and other benefits.
""Negotiations took place in an atmosphere of great uncertainty due to the environment of ultra-low interest rates, increasing inflation, and a dramatic geopolitical crisis in Europe,"" said Michael Ilgner, head of personnel at Deutsche Bank. 
Workers went on a strike on Friday, the latest volley in the pay negotiations ahead of Tuesday's third round of talks.
Attention now turns to wage talks for 60,000 workers at Germany's public-sector banks and 140,000 workers at private banks.
Those workers have been seeking a 4.5% pay increase, as well as other rights such as working outside the office. That wage dispute has been going since last year.
High inflation has strengthened the hand of union officials, but banks have faced stiff competition and low profits, which has resulted in efforts to cut costs and reduce headcount.

Germany has more banks per capita than most of its neighbours and other industrialised economies.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Employees of the Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co staged walkouts and social media campaigns on Tuesday to protest the company's response to Florida legislation that would limit classroom discussion of sexual orientation or gender identity. 
In a rare public demonstration of unrest, about 60 Disney employees gathered at a park outside of Los Angeles, where they wielded signs calling on Disney to ""protect LGBTQ kids"" and chanted ""Disney say gay. We won't go away."" 
""A lot of people enjoy working for Disney. And a lot of people are upset that the company they love is harming the subset of employees and their community in Florida,” said Taylor White, a technical director at Disney television.
Disney has encountered internal criticism about its public stance toward the legislation, which critics call the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. 
On Tuesday, some employees walked in a demonstration around the perimeter of the nearby Disney studios lot. Other employees spoke out via Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). The turnout was modest for Disney, which employs some 16,000 people in Burbank and Glendale, though many are working from home because of the pandemic.
The protests culminated a week of abbreviated walk-outs during scheduled breaks, as part of a campaign dubbed the ""Disney Do Better Walkout."" 
The organizers called on Disney to cease campaign contributions to politicians supporting the Florida measure and to develop a plan to protect employees from such legislation. They also want Disney to halt construction in Florida, home of the company's flagship Walt Disney World theme park, until the state repeals the measure, which Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has indicated he will sign it into law. If so, it goes into effect July 1.
Disney attempted to address employee concerns though a virtual town hall for employees on Monday. CEO Bob Chapek said the company made a mistake initially remaining publicly silent on the legislation and pledged to use the moment as a catalyst for change. 

“We know how important this issue is for our LGBTQ+ employees, their families and allies, we respect our colleagues’ right to express their views,"" a Disney spokesperson said. ""And we pledge our ongoing support of the LGBTQ+ community in the fight for equal rights.”
Ahead of Tuesday's demonstrations, one unit within the company, Disney+, offered public support for LGBTQIA+ colleagues on Twitter, writing, ""we strongly denounce all legislation that infringes on the basic human rights of people in the LGBTQIA+ community.""

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher Wednesday, continuing  to rebound after recent losses caused by the Ukraine war and the associated inflation concerns. 
By 4:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.4% higher, the CAC 40 in France traded up 0.4%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.5%.
European indices are following the global trend higher, with a positive close on Wall Street late Tuesday and Asian shares following suit overnight. Cash is returning to the beaten-up equity markets, largely from the bond markets as investors braced for central banks, and the U.S. Federal Reserve, in particular, to take aggressive approaches to taming inflation.
That said, these gains remain tentative as the war in Ukraine rages on, with Russian air strikes continuing to pound the besieged port city of Mariupol in the south of the country.
Investors are looking forward to the arrival of U.S. President Joe Biden for talks with NATO and European leaders in Brussels, starting later in the session, amid expectations for more sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and moves to tighten existing measures.
Elsewhere, U.K. consumer prices rose 0.8% on the month in February, soaring 6.2% on the year, the fastest rate in 30 years. This will put further pressure on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to help his citizens suffering a cost of living crisis in his Spring Statement to Parliament.
In the corporate sector, automakers were among the top gainers, with Automotive Cells Company, a joint venture between Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), Mercedes Benz (DE:MBGn) and TotalEnergies (PA:TTEF), announcing plans to build a battery plant in Italy.
The battery plant would be the third in Europe for Stellantis, after ones already announced in France and Germany, which are also being built through ACC.
TotalEnergies stock rose 0.1% after the French energy company’s CEO Patrick Pouyanné said that its decision to quit Russian oil supply contracts does not put the overall future of the company at risk.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday after industry data pointed to another drop in U.S. crude inventories, increasing concerns about the tight nature of the global market.
Tuesday’s numbers from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stocks in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, confounding expectations for a small increase. 
The official government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the session. 
By 4:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% higher at $110.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.1% to $116.75.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,923.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.1016.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Moderna Inc is sponsoring sumo flags in its first such promotion in Japan, as the COVID-19 vaccine maker seeks to wrestle market share from compatriot  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE)
The U.S. firm's introduction to the broader Japanese public was set back after some of its doses last year were found to be contaminated, although it has clawed back market share since with the help of a government-endorsed programme.
Now, as the government plans a fourth-dose vaccination programme,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) is looking to sumo to boost its public appeal as it seeks to expand beyond COVID-19 shots.
The sumo flags, known as kensho-hata, are held by banner bearers circling the sumo ring and have traditionally served as ads for everyday goods such as vitamins, teas, juices and rice.
Moderna debuted its banner on March 13 at the start of the national sport's two-week spring tournament - a simple white design with the company name in chunky, red, sumo-style script.
The promotion signals the company's growth aspirations in Japan, which has come to know Moderna through some 50 million doses of its mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine imported last year by local partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.
Those doses made up less than 20% of shots in Japan's initial double-shot inoculation push, with the bulk made up of the shot Pfizer developed with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX).
During that time, 1.63 million Moderna doses were recalled in Japan after metal fragments were found in some vials - a problem traced to a partner factory in Spain.
When booster shots became available, residents rushed to book appointments for Pfizer supplies, leaving many Moderna slots vacant. That prompted the government to actively promote a vaccine mix-and-match strategy, emphasising speed over brand.
That helped the numbers even out, with Moderna accounting for about 42% of booster shots.
Last week, the government said vaccines for fourth doses will be split nearly even between the two suppliers. It plans to secure 75 million doses from Pfizer and 70 million from Moderna.
For the fourth shot, which is under development and will be a combination of vaccines designed for the Delta and Omicron variants of the novel coronavirus, Moderna directly holds the rights in Japan, Rami Suzuki, Moderna's recently appointed representative director in Japan, told Reuters.
Takeda said it is in discussion with Moderna about distribution.
Moderna, founded in 2010 and based in Cambridge in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, did not have an office in Japan until October, and Suzuki, who previously held roles at pharmaceutical firms Janssen and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd, joined in November.
Going forward, the company plans to combine COVID-19 and influenza vaccines in one shot, with possible market introduction in 2023, Suzuki said. Later, the combined shot could include a third vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), she said.
The Japan push comes as Moderna increases its Asia presence with a plan to produce mRNA vaccines in Australia and create four subsidiaries in Malaysia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong.

It also has a vaccine production deal with South Korean drugmaker Samsung (KS:005930) BioLogics Co Ltd.
Based on trials showing Moderna's shot has the strongest antibody effect when combined with other vaccines, the firm ""still has opportunity to seize market share from Pfizer in terms of boosters,"" said healthcare analyst Xinyao Wang, who publishes on the SmartKarma platform.

345,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 03:56AM ET</span>",Marketmind: That inflation headache,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Dhara Ranasinghe. 
Data this morning showing British inflation rose to a new 30-year high of 6.2% last month, is a reminder perhaps that tackling price pressures could require more not less monetary tightening.
While the Bank of England raised rates again last week to curb inflation, it softened its language on the need for more increases as households face a huge hit from soaring energy bills. 
For some analysts, under estimating inflation trends longer-term by the BoE means long-dated British government bonds or gilts stand to significantly underperform German and U.S. peers this year. 
Graphic: UK inflation surges again: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/byvrjblobve/UKINFLATION.PNG 
Market focus will stay with Britain, with Finance minister Rishi Sunak due to give a budget update in parliament at around 1230 GMT. He's expected to add to the support he gave households only last month to cope with energy bills.
No doubt central banks are in a bind. The Federal Reserve is adamant it will put battling inflation first with more U.S. policymakers overnight calling for bigger hikes. 
As a result, Fed funds futures suggest traders are anticipating more aggressive rate hikes ahead. Traders now see the federal funds rate rising to the 2.25%-2.5% range by year-end, higher than the 1.9% suggested by Fed forecasts last week.
Stock markets continue to take growing unease in bond markets over higher rates in their stride meanwhile. Asia equities have hit three-week highs, while European and U.S. stock market futures are higher. 
Note, two-year Treasury yields are up 73 bps so far in March, set for their biggest monthly jump since 2004.
Maybe the stabilisation in many financial markets is a reason to hope that investors are coming to terms with the prospect of higher rates. Time will tell. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Wednesday: 
- Biden heads to Europe with more sanctions for Russia -
- Japan's 10-year bond yield rises to one-month high
- Flash euro zone consumer confidence
- NATO chief Stoltenberg press conference
- Russian central bank deputy governor Russian Central Bank Alexey Zabotkin speaks to Duma

SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) -Hong Kong-based activist fund Oasis Management has voted in favour of a shareholder proposal demanding Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp solicit buyout offers from private equity firms, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Oasis also voted against the Japanese industrial conglomerate's plan to break itself up, said the source, who was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.
The upcoming vote at an extraordinary general meeting on Thursday marks a pivotal moment in a long-running battle between Toshiba management and its growing number of foreign shareholders. Each proposal needs 50% of the vote to pass. 
Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners, Toshiba's second-largest shareholder, submitted the proposal - a motion that also has the support of its top shareholder Effissimo Capital Management and No. 3 shareholder Farallon Capital Management. 
Together, the top three shareholders own around a quarter of Toshiba. All foreign activist funds combined are estimated to hold about 30% while more broadly overseas investors own 50% of the industrial conglomerate.

Oasis, which has not disclosed the size of its stake in Toshiba, declined to comment.
Toshiba said it would continue to make every effort to gain shareholder support for the break-up plan.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2022 03:17AM ET</span>","China's ZTE exits probation after U.S. court ruling, shares soar","By Karen Freifeld
(Reuters) -China's ZTE Corp (HK:0763) saw its shares soar as much as 60% in Hong Kong on Tuesday after the telecommunications equipment maker completed five years of probation in the United States, marking the end of a U.S. criminal case.
ZTE's probation - imposed in a 2017 guilty plea deal for illegally shipping U.S. technology to Iran, and extended in 2018 - ended on schedule on March 22, despite a possible violation.
An alleged visa fraud had raised the possibility of additional penalties, sending ZTE's stock plummeting earlier this month, but a U.S. judge on Tuesday ruled against further action by the court.
ZTE is still subject to a 2018 settlement agreement with the U.S. Commerce Department.
ZTE suspended trading in its Shenzhen and Hong Kong-listed shares following the ruling and before markets opened Wednesday. Upon resuming trade at 0500 GMT, its Hong Kong stock registered its biggest daily percentage gain since its December 2004 debut.
Its Shenzhen stock rose 10% to its highest since March 10.
ZTE had been accused of violating probation over an alleged conspiracy to commit visa fraud. According to an indictment unsealed last March, a former ZTE research director and a Georgia Institute of Technology professor allegedly conspired to bring Chinese nationals to the U.S. to conduct research at ZTE from at least 2014 through 2018 while on J-1 visas sponsored by the university.
While ZTE has not been charged in the visa case, which is pending in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade held a hearing in Dallas last week on the fraud allegation as a possible violation of ZTE's probation. 
In his Tuesday ruling, the judge found ZTE was legally responsible for the actions of the former ZTE director.
But he decided to not take any further action against ZTE, which had already reached the maximum term of probation and, ZTE argued, had already been fined the maximum as well.
As part of its 2017 plea deal, ZTE paid the U.S. $892 million.
There was an ""open question about legal tools left for the court,"" the judge wrote.
Despite the favorable ruling, the judge encouraged the government to pursue any reasonable charges and criminal or civil penalties against the company, especially for export compliance matters.
PENALTIES
The visa issue was not the first problem that surfaced for ZTE since the plea deal. In 2018, the U.S. Commerce Department found ZTE made false statements about disciplining executives tied to the illegal shipments to Iran and, as a result, issued a total ban on the company buying U.S. components.
ZTE, which ceased major operations as a result of the ban, paid a $1 billion penalty and agreed to change its leadership and cooperate with a 10-year monitor appointed by the Commerce Department, as part of a settlement lifting the ban.
The judge took action in 2018 over the false statements, too, extending ZTE's probation and a court-appointed monitor from three to five years.
In his Tuesday ruling, the judge noted that ZTE argued the visa-fraud related events occurred more than three years ago, and that new leadership had brought an improved export compliance program.
""The Company has made strides,"" the judge said, adding that ZTE's export control and compliance programs were effectively ""nonexistent"" when it was originally sentenced.
He said he considered ZTE's compliance a mitigating factor, but that its record of compliance could be summarized in one word: ""sometimes.""
ZTE in a statement to Reuters said it was ""proud of the significant improvement in the company's compliance program and culture."" It said the improvement had been acknowledged over the years.
Evans Rice, a lawyer for ZTE, said in court last week that, in 2020, the court-appointed monitor had recognized ""a sea change"" in the company's commitment to compliance and cooperation.
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The professor charged in the visa case, Gee-Kung Chang, has pleaded not guilty. The status of the former ZTE research director, Jianjun Yu, is unclear. ZTE said he left the company in 2019.

The case against ZTE was the first of a series of U.S. government actions against major Chinese tech companies that caused tensions in U.S.-China relations. 
It was followed by a case, still pending, against Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, the hobbled Chinese telecommunications equipment giant, which was also placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in 2019 for activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests.

The major indices closed higher on Wall Street late Tuesday, led by a 2% gain in the NASDAQ Composite, and Asian shares followed suit overnight, with Japan's Nikkei jumping 2.5% to touch a two-month high. 
European indices are set to continue the recovery as cash returns to the beaten-up equity markets, largely from the bond markets as investors braced for central banks, and the U.S. Federal Reserve, in particular, to take aggressive approaches to taming inflation.
That said, these gains remain tentative as the war in Ukraine rages on, with Russian air strikes continuing to pound the besieged port city of Mariupol in the south of the country.
Talks between Ukraine and Russia are confrontational but moving forward, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday, ahead of the arrival of U.S. President Joe Biden for talks with NATO and European leaders in Brussels, starting later in the day.
Biden is expected to bring with him plans for more sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and moves to tighten existing measures.
Elsewhere, U.K. consumer prices rose 0.8% on the month in February, soaring 6.2% on the year, the fastest rate in 30 years. This will put further pressure on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to help his citizens suffering a cost of living crisis in his Spring Statement to Parliament.
Oil prices edged higher Wednesday after industry data pointed to another drop in U.S. crude inventories, increasing concerns about the tight nature of the global market.
Tuesday’s numbers from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude stocks in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer, fell by 4.3 million barrels last week, confounding expectations for a small increase. 
The official government data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due later in the session. 
By 3:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.6% higher at $109.92 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.8% to $116.43.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,918.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1032."

(Reuters) - Hundreds of companies have said they are withdrawing or suspending operations in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, from energy producer Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc to carmaker Hyundai Motor Co to PwC, a global professional services firm.
The following is a look at how insurance and international arbitration might soften the blow to those companies, which stand to lose billions of dollars:
DOES STANDARD INSURANCE PROVIDE COVERAGE?
No, but companies can purchase political risk as an add-on to trade credit, property and aviation insurance. It covers government seizures of property and forced abandonment, cancellations of government licenses for operations such as mines and the inability to convert foreign currency. The insurance typically covers long-term energy or infrastructure projects, but can be purchased by other types of businesses. Policies are confidential, insurance experts said, and disputes are resolved in private arbitration.
Berne Union, a trade association representing political risk insurers, estimated that $1 billion in new political risk insurance was written in Russia in 2020, its most recent data. 
Much of the insurance is written by non-commercial agencies such as the Overseas Private Investment Corp of the United States and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, part of the World Bank.
WILL COMPANIES LEAVING RUSSIA HAVE CLAIMS?
Companies that leave and abandon their business without any action taken by the Russia government to seize control of their assets will have a tough time collecting insurance, according to legal experts. 
""You see companies saying 'we're leaving because we support Ukraine.' The question is then whether the policy covers a voluntary departure,"" said Micah Skidmore of the law firm Haynes and Boone. 
Insurers are most likely to pay claims for revenues earned in Russian roubles that are no longer convertible to foreign currency, said legal experts. 
WHAT MIGHT HELP COMPANIES RECOUP THEIR LOSSES? 
Russia could take actions that would support claims that assets are being seized. Last week, Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed into law a measure that allows the country to place planes leased from foreign companies on Russia's aircraft register.
Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp said earlier this month the Russian law demonstrates Moscow's intent to confiscate planes and the company expected the move to help the company collect on its insurance.
Sanctions give the aircraft leasing industry until March 28 to sever ties with Russian airlines. If more than 400 jets in Russia are not repossessed, the industry stands to lose almost $10 billion.
Russia's ruling United Russia party said in early March it is considering a proposal to nationalize foreign-owned firms that leave the country. If enacted, this measure could also support claims for insurance.
ARE THERE OTHER AVENUES FOR COMPENSATION?
A company can look to trade agreements signed by Russia which provide for arbitration when government actions damage foreign investment. 
The Steptoe & Johnson law firm said last week in a note to clients that classic international arbitration claims include failure to protect intellectual property rights, refusal to release aircraft and expropriation of assets. 
At least nine companies from Ukraine used trade agreements to seek billions through arbitration from Russia after Moscow annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014. 
However, the international arbitration process can take years and Russia does not voluntarily pay awards, according to legal experts. 

Franz Sedelmayer, whose German security equipment business was expropriated by Russia in 1996, won a $2.3 million arbitration award in 1998 but spent more than a decade fighting in numerous courts trying to collect the money.
A company would not be able to collect on both insurance and arbitration.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Wednesday morning, with the U.S. Federal Reserve’s tougher stance on inflation driving gains on Wall Street but deepening a Treasury selloff.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.94% by 11:13 PM ET (3:13 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.61%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.46%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 1.9%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.49% and the Shenzhen Component gained 0.67%.
U.S. contracts fluctuated, but the S&P 500 was up for the fifth session in six. However, U.S. Treasuries held its losses from Monday, when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled that a half-point interest-rate hike could be possible at the central bank’s next meeting. Short-term U.S. government bonds fell toward their worst quarterly performance in almost four decades, while Australian and New Zealand debt also weakened.
Central banks are moving towards tightening their monetary policy in response to rising inflation, which has risen to 40-year highs as the war on Ukraine led to rising commodity prices.
Even the Fed’s more dovish policymakers agree with Powell’s statement that interest rates should be hiked at a quicker pace, with the economy strong enough to weather higher borrowing costs. Equity markets seem to be responding to that message, with some investors leaning into stocks as an inflation hedge.
“We are positive for equities for this year,” Principal Global Investors chief strategist Seema Shah told Bloomberg. While the market may be more challenged in 2023 and recession risks are rising, “we still think the U.S. economy is pretty good fundamentally,” she said.
“Faster hikes are clearly going to help inflation come down,” which may reduce the need for a longer tightening campaign, she added.
The Fed is expected to hike interest rates six more times within 2022, after raising it to 0.5% in its latest policy decision handed down during the previous week. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said on Tuesday that it was time to remove policy accommodation, while St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester called for faster hikes.
Powell, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will also speak at the BIS innovation summit later in the day.
Concerns about economic growth are mounting, as the war in Ukraine shows little sign of resolution. U.S. President Joe Biden and allies will meet in Brussels, where they are expected to announce new sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. They are also expected to introduce fresh measures designed to keep Russia from sidestepping existing economic penalties.
Investors will also monitor commodity markets, with the U.S. and U.K. reaching a deal to ease tariffs on British steel and aluminum that could ease some inflationary pressures.
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak will deliver his “spring statement” on the budget later in the day, with U.S. durable goods orders data due a day later."
353,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 11:09PM ET</span>","Tencent Share Buyback Speculation Grows After Alibaba, Xiaomi","(Bloomberg) -- Share buybacks are emerging as the hottest trend among Chinese tech giants and industry leader Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. may be the next to jump on the bandwagon.
The online gaming giant climbed as much as 3.1% in Hong Kong on Wednesday, just before it’s expected to announce its slowest profit growth ever. Investors are betting that the company will follow in the footsteps of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp., which both announced massive buybacks after their earnings, with the moves fueling a rally in their shares. 
The improving sentiment in tech stocks reflects broader hopes that China’s crackdown on the sector is coming to an end after the government pledged greater support for the economy and capital markets. But, a recovery remains dependent on concrete action from the authorities, and Morgan Stanley’s equity strategists warn that it’s too early to be optimistic.
“Alibaba and Xiaomi have probably kick-started shareholders’ focus on buybacks after a horrendous performance in share prices in the last year,” said Kerry Goh, chief investment officer at Kamet Capital Partners Pte. “Tougher restrictions on investing in other firms, coupled with a strong balance sheet and good cash flow should motivate Tencent to do a share buyback like the others.”
An 18% surge in Alibaba’s stock since Tuesday indicates that share buybacks have become a more rewarding strategy for Chinese tech giants, after valuations slumped to near record lows and regulatory fears eased. Still, the scale of repurchases is small compared to megacaps in the U.S., which have bought back more than $20 billion worth of stock in each of the recent quarters. 
“In consideration of cash usage, shareholder returns may now become a priority over something, say like the M&A back in the past,” said Vey-Sern Ling, senior analyst at Union Bancaire Privee.
Tencent boosted its dividend payout, including offering JD (NASDAQ:JD).Com Inc. shares, in order to lure investors. But, those moves have failed to reverse a downtrend in its stock. This year, Tencent overtook Alibaba to become the biggest loser in China’s tech rout after it shed about $450 billion in market value since last February. 
Tencent certainly has the financial resources for a buyback. The company held about $40 billion in cash and short-term instruments on its balance sheet at the end of September, a figure that may well have increased when it reports the December quarter results.
The company’s business is under pressure with revenue growth projected to fall to its slowest pace on record when it reports earnings later Wednesday. Tencent’s games business has been handicapped by Beijing’s freeze on new titles, while its online advertising business is expected to have contracted for the first time on record in the fourth quarter.
Still, many analysts see opportunity in a buyback after Tencent plunged during Beijing’s crackdown, at one point shedding more than $500 billion in market value. Even after their recent rally, the shares trade at about 16 times earnings compared with Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).’s 32 times and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).’s multiple of more than 100.

354,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 09:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Cannabis producer Cresco nears $2 billion purchase of Columbia Care - sources,"By Shariq Khan
(Reuters) - U.S. cannabis producer Cresco Labs (OTC:CRLBF) Inc is in advanced talks to buy rival Columbia Care (OTC:CCHWF) Inc for around $2 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
If a deal is finalised it would be one of the largest in the U.S. cannabis industry to date. The industry, still in its infancy, continues to operate in a regulatory environment defined by a patchwork of laws that vary from state to state.
A deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday, the sources said. Exact terms of the deal could not be learnt.
The people cautioned that talks could still fall apart and highlighted that the companies have overlapping footprints in multiple states, including in the key New York market, and could require significant divestitures - a possible hurdle in reaching an agreement.
The sources requested anonymity as the discussions were confidential.
Cresco Labs and Columbia Care did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Cannabis sales in the United States have been booming and are forecast to reach $46 billion by 2026, according to industry research firm BDSA, as states like New York and New Jersey open up.
Still, margins and profits remain thin and analysts and investors have called for consolidation to improve profitability by finding savings in scale.
The AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis exchange-traded fund has lost 19% of its value so far this year.
Columbia Care stock has risen about 9% this year but it is down almost 70% since it started trading in 2019. Cresco Labs shares have slumped 63% from a 2021 peak.

Both companies are listed in Canada and trade over-the-counter in the United States as marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, and the two large U.S. stock exchanges cannot allow companies that grow or sell the plant to list their shares.
Cresco is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter financials on Wednesday, while Columbia Care last week postponed its earnings to Thursday.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 09:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive - Chinese regulators ask some U.S.-listed firms to prepare for audit disclosures - sources,"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese regulators have asked some of the country's U.S.-listed firms, including  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Baidu and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com, to prepare for more audit disclosures, sources said, as Beijing steps up efforts to ensure domestic companies remain listed in New York.
This comes as China's regulators are considering a proposal to allow their U.S. counterparts to inspect audit working papers of some Chinese firms that do not gather sensitive data, two of the sources said.
As part of that move, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and other regulatory agencies earlier this month summoned top internet companies, including search engine leader Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU) and e-commerce major JD.com Inc, four sources told Reuters.
Other internet firms summoned by the regulator included Alibaba Group and Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) Corp, two of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. E-retailer  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc and gaming firm NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) Inc also attended the meeting, one of them added. 
They were asked to prepare audit documents for the 2021 financial year keeping in mind U.S. regulators' requests for more disclosure, said the sources, who declined to be named as they were not allowed to discuss details of the meeting.
The companies should better seek Chinese regulators' advice if they are ""uncertain about anything"" during the whole process the first source said, which includes auditing and communications with U.S. regulators.
CSRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com and Weibo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pinduoduo and NetEase also did not immediately provide comment.
The latest step by the Chinese regulators shows Beijing's willingness to make some concessions to resolve a long-running Sino-U.S. audit stand-off that has put hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments in Chinese companies at stake. 
The U.S. authorities are moving towards kicking Chinese companies off American stock exchanges, if the companies' audit records are unavailable for their inspection for three years in a row.
DELISTING RISKS
In December, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) finalised rules to delist Chinese companies under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), and said it had identified 273 companies that were at risk, without naming them.
The SEC earlier this month named for the first time five of these firms, including KFC operator Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC) and biotech firm  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) Ltd, that could face delisting.
Describing the SEC move as ""normal procedure"", CSRC said it was confident it would reach an agreement with U.S. counterparts to solve the dispute.
Chinese regulators' deliberations with the New York-listed domestic companies on more audit disclosure were ongoing, three of the sources said. 
Washington has long demanded complete access to the books of U.S.-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing, citing national security concerns, bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms. 
A map on the website https://pcaobus.org/oversight/international of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), an auditor oversight body tasked to help keep publicly traded companies in the United States in check, showed China as the only jurisdiction that denied the organisation ""necessary access to conduct oversight"". 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimated on March 11 that U.S. institutional investors held around $200 billion of exposure to Chinese companies' American depositary receipts (ADRs).

The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese companies traded on Wall Street, fell nearly 60% over the past 12 months. 
In an attempt to calm investor fears, China's Vice Premier Liu He said last week talks between Chinese and U.S. regulators on companies listed in the United States have made progress and both sides are working on specific cooperation plans.

356,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 09:11PM ET</span>","U.S. SEC to Elon Musk: Regarding your tweets, a deal is a deal","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The top U.S. securities regulator on Tuesday urged a federal judge not to let Elon Musk escape an agreement requiring that his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) use be monitored, which the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive considers part of a campaign of harassment.
In a filing in the federal court in Manhattan, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Musk had not met his ""high burden"" to set aside a 2018 consent decree requiring that Tesla lawyers approve tweets and other public statements that could be material to his electric car company. 
It's not enough that Musk found compliance ""less convenient than he had hoped,"" or wished the SEC would stop investigating Tesla's disclosure procedures.
""When it comes to civil settlements, a deal is a deal, absent far more compelling circumstances than are here presented,"" the SEC said.
The regulatory agency also urged U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who oversees the decree, to reject Musk's bid to quash a subpoena requesting records concerning his Twitter poll last November over whether to sell 10% of his Tesla stock.
Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, declined to comment. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Legal experts have said Musk is unlikely to have the decree set aside.
Earlier on Tuesday, Musk danced and joked with fans as he oversaw the opening of Tesla's first European factory, located near Berlin, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in attendance.
Tesla also has a factory in Shanghai. The company has made Musk the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine.
The SEC dispute stems from the regulator's claim that Musk defrauded investors on Aug. 7, 2018, by tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to potentially take his electric car company private at a premium, when in reality a buyout was not close.
Tesla and Musk settled by each paying a $20 million civil fine, with Musk stepping down as Tesla's chairman.
Musk has since accused the SEC of harassing him with ""roving and unbound"" investigations, in a bad-faith effort to punish him for criticizing the government and exercising his constitutional right to free speech under the First Amendment.
But the SEC said it has broad authority and a ""legitimate purpose"" to investigate Musk and Tesla, and that Musk could oppose the subpoena only through a subpoena enforcement action.
""Musk complains about 'the sheer number of demands' by the SEC from 2018 to the present, which he characterizes as harassment,"" the SEC said.
""But Musk's own chronology of alleged demands is both underwhelming and reflects legitimate inquiries as to new potentially violative conduct by Tesla and Musk,"" it added.

The subpoena related to Musk's tweet that he would offload 10% of his Tesla stake if users approved.
A majority did, and the poll caused Tesla's share price to fall. Musk has since sold more than $16 billion of Tesla stock.

WUZHOU, China (Reuters) -Rescuers in southern China searched for victims from a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) jet on Tuesday after it crashed with 132 people on board and authorities said severe damage to the aircraft would make it difficult to establish the cause of the crash. 
Flight MU5735 was headed on Monday for the port city of Guangzhou from Kunming, capital of the southwestern province of Yunnan, when it plunged from cruising altitude to crash in the mountains of Guangxi less than an hour before landing time.
A jet appeared to dive to the ground at an angle of about 35 degrees from the vertical in video images from a vehicle's dashboard camera, according to Chinese media. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
No survivors have been found, said Zhu Tao, director of aviation safety at the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), told reporters.
""The jet was seriously damaged during the crash, and investigations will face a very high level of difficulty,"" Zhu said at the first government briefing on the disaster.
""Given the information currently available, we still do not have a clear assessment of the cause for the crash,"" he said, adding that the aircraft did not respond to repeated calls from air controllers during its rapid descent. 
On Tuesday, rescuers combed heavily forested mountain slopes in southern China, using shovels and torches in their search for victims and flight recorders from the jet. 
About 600 soldiers, firefighters and police marched to the crash site, a patch of about 1 square kilometre (0.4 square mile) in a location hemmed in by mountains on three sides, after excavators cleared a path, state television said.
It added that the search for the recorders, or ""black boxes"", of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 involved in China's first crash of a commercial jetliner since 2010, would be carried out in grid-by-grid fashion, probably through the night. 
'BANG, BANG'
Si, 64, a villager near the crash site who declined to give his first name, told Reuters he heard a ""bang, bang"" at the time of the crash. 
""It was like thunder,"" he said. 
State television has shown images of plane debris strewn among trees charred by fire. Burnt remains of identity cards and wallets were also seen. 
Rain was forecast in the area this week. 
Police set up a checkpoint at Lu village, on the approach to the site, and barred journalists from entering. Several people gathered for a small Buddhist ceremony nearby to pray for the victims. 
The last commercial jetliner to crash in China was in 2010, when an Embraer E-190 regional jet flown by Henan Airlines went down, killing 44 of the 96 aboard.
Highlighting the top-level concern, Vice Premier Liu He went to Guangxi on Monday night to oversee search and rescue operations. An official of the same rank was similarly sent to the site of the 2010 crash in northeast China. 
""That B737-800 jet met airworthiness standards before taking off and technical conditions were stable,"" Sun Shiying, a China Eastern official, said at the briefing.
""The crew members were in good health, and their flying experience was in line with regulatory requirements,"" he said.
PLANES GROUNDED
The disaster comes as Boeing seeks to rebound from several crises, notably the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on air travel and safety concerns over its 737 MAX model following two deadly crashes.
""Accidents that start at cruise altitude are usually caused by weather, deliberate sabotage, or pilot error,"" Dan Elwell, a former head of U.S. regulator the Federal Aviation Administration, told Reuters.
Elwell, who led the FAA during the 737-MAX crisis, said mechanical failures in modern commercial jets were rare at cruise altitude.
The 737-800 was delivered on June 22, 2015, and accumulated 18,239 hours of flight time after 8,986 flights, said Zhu.
Chinese investigators are leading the probe because the crash took place there, but U.S. authorities will provide aid because the plane was U.S.-made.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Tuesday it was in touch with CAAC's investigator-in-charge and would support the investigation with technical advisers from the Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing and engine manufacturer CFM in all ways necessary.

China has strict quarantine policies due to the pandemic. No decision has been made yet about whether U.S. authorities will travel there for the investigation, a NTSB spokesperson said.
On Monday, China Eastern and two subsidiaries grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes. The group has 225 of the aircraft, data from British aviation consultancy IBA shows.

358,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 07:58PM ET</span>",Investors say U.S. SEC climate disclosure rule to clarify 'mixed bag' of data,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors, including several who run environmentally focused funds, welcomed the U.S. government's proposed new rule on corporate disclosure of climate-related risks and emissions, saying it would standardize reports that now are voluntary and vary widely in quality and breadth.
The investors said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's draft regulation, if finalized, would make it easier for money managers to judge how different companies and industries are handling the challenges and opportunities of a warming planet. 
U.S. environmental, social and governance-focused funds (ESG) took in a record $71 billion last year, up from $51 billion in 2020, according to Morningstar, and experts noted shareholders have been seeking better data.[nL1N2SM2EH]
Their responses to the draft could shape the final version of the rule the SEC may eventually pass.
Lack of consistent corporate disclosures to date has made such analysis difficult for investors focused on ESG concerns. 
""Right now you have a lot of disparate information coming from different places. This should streamline how all investors, not just those focused on ESG investing, can look at the data,"" said Sarah Bratton Hughes, head of ESG and sustainable investing for American Century Investments in Kansas City.
Dan Abbasi, who runs a $200 million environmentally focused investment strategy for Douglass Winthrop Advisors in New York, said the proposed rules also could help fund managers select companies that stand to benefit from a transition to a lower-carbon economy.
""It's going to give us additional material to work with in terms of how management not only sees the risks of climate change, but how they are seizing the opportunity,"" he said.
The draft rule calls for companies to disclose their direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and supplier and partner emissions, known as Scope 3 emissions, if material.
WIDE RANGE OF REPORTS
SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said the commission wants to simplify reporting as investor interest in climate data surges. As of February 41 U.S. shareholder proposals called for some form of new climate disclosures, according to proxy solicitor Georgeson.
Gensler cited a report that found 65% of Russell 1000 companies published ""sustainability reports"" in 2019. But the report, by the Governance & Accountability Institute, found only around half of companies in some sectors like communications and finance published those reports, which companies organized using a range of frameworks.
""The reporting right now is all voluntary, so you have companies that don't do any reporting, or they're doing more communications or marketing reports than comparable, reliable investor-grade material,"" said Gary Levante, senior vice president of corporate responsibility at Berkshire Bank.
""A 'mixed bag' is the best way to describe it,"" he said.
CHALLENGES REMAIN
The proposed rule was advanced by a vote of 3-1, with the dissent coming from the commission's lone Republican Hester Peirce. The Chamber of Commerce, the largest U.S. business lobby, called the proposal too prescriptive.
On the other end of the spectrum, several climate-focused activist investors said they supported the new rules even though they would prefer the SEC mandate more Scope 3 disclosures.
""It's a reasonable rule. Scope 3 is very difficult to measure, but for some sectors, like the food sector, it's where their emissions lie,"" said Leslie Samuelrich, president of Green Century Capital Management.
The Investment Company Institute, which represents global investors, broadly welcomed the rule but said it will ""carefully study"" the Scope 3 requirements. 

Mark Gibbens, a Kansas City financial advisor and CEO of Erudite Capital, said the SEC struck a good balance. Whatever Scope 3 reporting burdens companies may face, he said, were unlikely to affect performance of energy-focused ETFs he holds such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund. 
""I'm not worried,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Tuesday, led by a 2% gain in the Nasdaq, as shares of technology and other big growth names rebounded from recent losses and  Nike  rose after it reported upbeat results.
Financial shares also were among the day's best performers as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 2.368%, with the S&P 500 bank index up 2.5%.
Every S&P 500 sector but energy ended higher on the day. The three major indexes have gained in five of the last six sessions. 
The Federal Reserve last week raised the federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point from the near-zero level, and Fed officials are doing little to downplay rising market expectations the U.S. central bank will raise rates by half a percentage point in May to tame inflation.
While higher borrowing costs are a negative for consumers and many businesses, they help to boost the profit outlook for banks.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc gave the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 technology index rose 1.4% on the day, but remained down 10% for the quarter so far, among the sharpest declines of the major sectors.

""Underneath all of it is that economic and earnings data have remained fairly good.""
Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) shares rose 2.2% after the company beat quarterly profit and revenue expectations and said manufacturing issues pinching sales over the past six months were in the rear view mirror.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.47 points, or 0.74%, to 34,807.46, the S&P 500 gained 50.43 points, or 1.13%, to 4,511.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 270.36 points, or 1.95%, to 14,108.82.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in January he hopes to see investors ""Mexicanize"" the unit, still commonly known as Banamex, its name before Citi purchased it in 2001.
Lopez Obrador floated the names of several Mexican billionaires, such as Ricardo Salinas, who runs Banco Azteca, and Banorte's Carlos Hank Gonzalez as potential buyers.
""This is a historic opportunity to strengthen the national banking system, bringing together businessmen and the Mexican public,"" Gonzalez said in the statement. ""For Banorte, it would be a pride to champion this initiative, in case it is judged beneficial for our investors and banking users."" 
Banorte said after the sale was announced in January it would analyze a potential bid. Citi has yet to set a date to ""open the books"" and make terms of the sale transparent, a Banorte spokesperson told Reuters on Tuesday. 
In the statement, Banorte said it would invite its national network of entrepreneurs, as well as ""all Mexicans,"" to invest in the purchase without a minimum buy-in, if Banorte decides to place a bid.

Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser announced the sale in January, in line with the institution's recent strategy of exiting international markets.
Meanwhile, an executive of the Mexican unit said in February that its commitment to the country was ""more active than ever"" as the bank announced a $68 million expansion and remodel plan.

GRUENHEIDE, Germany (Reuters) -Elon Musk was cheered as he oversaw the handover of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)'s first German-made cars at its Gruenheide plant on Tuesday, marking the start of the U.S. automaker's inaugural European hub just two years after it was first announced.
Loud music played as 30 clients and their families got a first glimpse of their shining new vehicles through a glitzy, neon-lit Tesla branded tunnel, clapping and cheering as Tesla Chief Executive Musk danced and joked with fans.
""This is a great day for the factory,"" Musk said, describing it as ""another step in the direction of a sustainable future"".
Musk said that Tesla is likely to launch a test version of its new ""Full Self-Driving"" software in Europe, possibly next year depending on regulatory approval.
""It's quite difficult to do full self-driving in Europe,"" he told factory workers on Tuesday, saying much work needs to be done to handle tricky driving situations in Europe where roads vary a lot by country. 
Although German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who also attended the event, lauded the gigafactory as the future of the car industry, it has faced opposition and some environmental activists blocked the factory's entrance while displaying banners flagging its high water use.
Two protestors abseiled from a motorway sign near the factory, blocking traffic for hours after the event.
Musk had hoped to begin output from the factory eight months ago, but licensing delays and local concerns around the plant's environmental impact held up the process.
Tesla was forced to service European orders from Shanghai while it awaited its German licence, adding to rising logistics costs at a time when it was struggling with industry-wide chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. 
It got the final go-ahead from local authorities on March 4 to begin production in Germany, provided it met conditions ranging from its water use to air pollution controls.
The plant opening came on the same day as the top U.S. securities regulator urged a federal judge not to let Musk back out of an agreement requiring that his Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) use be monitored.
Tesla shares ended up 7.9% at their highest level in more than two months on Tuesday. 
RACE WITH VW 
The new owners received the Model Y Performance configuration, a vehicle costing 63,990 euros ($70,500) with a 514 km (320 miles) range, Tesla said, adding that new orders from the plant could be delivered from April.
Tesla said that around 3,500 of the plant's expected 12,000 workers have been hired so far.
At full capacity, the plant will produce 500,000 cars a year, more than the 450,000 battery-electric vehicles that German rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) sold globally in 2021. 
It will also eventually generate 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery power, surpassing all other plants in Germany. Tesla is expected to initially import batteries from China for its German-made Model Ys before it starts local battery production.
Musk said on Tuesday that battery production will be a ""challenge"" next year and will be ""the limiting factor"" in the coming years, as Tesla aims to aggressively boost vehicle production. 
For now, Volkswagen still has the inside track in the race to electrify Europe's fleet, with a 25% market share to Tesla's 13%. Musk has said ramping up production would take longer than the two years it took to build the plant.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) predicted Gruenheide would produce around 54,000 cars in 2022, increasing to 280,000 in 2023 and 500,000 by 2025.
Volkswagen, which has received 95,000 EV orders in Europe this year, is planning a new 2 billion euro EV factory alongside its existing facility in Wolfsburg and six battery plants across Europe.

But its timeline lags Tesla's, with the EV factory due to open in 2026 and the first battery plant in 2023.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador postponed an unprecedented issue of a bitcoin-backed bond planned for last week, as the government decided to wait for favorable conditions in the financial market, Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said on Tuesday.
The Central American government had scheduled the launch of the $1 billion bond between 15-20 March, but the war between Russia and Ukraine and volatility of the cryptocurrency prompted authorities to change the date.
The launch could be postponed until September as bitcoin has swooned since hitting a record high above $67,500 in early November. It lost almost half its value by Jan. 22, and traded at $42,609 on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. 
Now is not the time to issue the bond, according to Zelaya who said that the ideal date to go on the market is the first half of the year, during an interview with a local television channel.

""In May or June the market variants are a little different. At the latest in September. After September, if you go out to the international market, it is difficult (to raise capital),"" he added
El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin as legal tender last year, generating criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which worries the measure could hurt the country's finances.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chief executives of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) will make the case Wednesday for U.S. government subsidies to boost semiconductor manufacturing before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee.
Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger will tell the committee ""there is an urgent need for the federal government to incentivize more private sector investment in the United States to enable a resilient and innovative semiconductor ecosystem,"" previously unreported testimony viewed by Reuters says. 
Micron Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra says in his written testimony that approving $52 billion for chips ""will kick start investment in workforce development, R&D, innovation, and expansion of manufacturing in the near term.""
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.
Both the Senate and House have passed versions of legislation approving $52 billion in chip subsidies in provisions known as the CHIPS Act but differ on other provisions aimed at boosting U.S. competitiveness with China.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo met with senators on Tuesday and urged quick action on chips.
""The situation now in America is urgent,"" Raimondo said. ""We have to decrease our dependence on other countries including Taiwan on chips and the way to do that is to make more chips in America.""
Mehrotra will also call on Congress to pass ""the refundable investment tax credit ... to create a long-term incentive that would invigorate domestic manufacturing in the semiconductor industry.""
Micron has announced plans to invest more than $150 billion globally over the next decade in leading-edge memory manufacturing and R&D and is considering building U.S. new fabs.
Building those new fabs in the United States ""require close coordination with federal and state policies to ensure the economic viability of our operations,"" Mehrotra's testimony says, adding ""we anticipate that a significant amount of federal funding will be required to make a mega-fab viable.""
Intel recently announced plans to invest $20 billion in Ohio to build two new mega fabs that could grow to eight mega fabs 
and $100 billion ""assuming support from the CHIPS Act,"" Gelsinger's testimony says.
Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) Chief Executive Officer Tim Archer, who heads the semiconductor manufacturing equipment company, will tell lawmakers new U.S. fabs ""will depend on semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials.""
Archer says a Commerce Department grant program should be able to ""provide incentives across the entire value chain"" and support an ""all-of-ecosystem approach.""

PACCAR (NASDAQ:PCAR) Chief Executive Officer Preston Feight will tell the committee the trucking manufacturing industry has been forced at times to pay brokers ""20 to 30 times"" the contract costs to get chips.
Feight's testimony suggests ""companies requesting CHIPS Act funding be required to meet the needs of American critical businesses, including truck manufacturers, before they are approved to receive U.S. taxpayer dollars.""

365,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 06:07PM ET</span>",Russian sanctions-linked firms run into hurdles with debt payments,"(Reuters) - Debt obligations from Russian companies linked to sanctioned billionaires were keeping investors on tenterhooks on Tuesday, as coupon payments to foreign holders of the securities ran into hurdles due to Western sanctions triggered by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
Russian steel producer Severstal, whose main shareholder, Alexey Mordashov, was sanctioned by the European Union on Feb. 28, was having trouble paying the holders of its debt, a source close to the company said. 
Evraz, the Russian steelmaker whose biggest shareholder is sanctioned Russian Roman Abramovich, said on Tuesday the coupon payment due March 21 was settled with the paying agent after it was temporarily blocked by a Western correspondent bank.
Fertiliser company EuroChem has also had problems making a coupon payment that was due on March 14 after being blocked by the paying agent, Bloomberg reported last week. The company announced on March 16 that Vladimir Rashevskiy has resigned as chief executive officer and from the board of directors effective March 15 after he had been sanctioned by the EU.
The hurdles faced by these firms show how punishing Western sanctions imposed following Russia's invasion are having broad impact, as banks turn cautious to avoid violating the rules. 
Russia, which calls its attack on Ukraine a ""special military operation,"" has also had its sovereign debt payments come under a microscope from international investors. 
So far, however, coupons due on dollar-denominated bonds appear to have been processed by intermediary banks under a temporary license issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
Russia's coupon payment on a sovereign bond maturing in 2029 was received on Monday, a bondholder said, the second time in recent days that the country appears to have averted default.
Assets and companies linked to rich Russian businessmen perceived to be close to President Vladimir Putin face particularly heightened scrutiny, as a number of them have been targeted by Western sanctions.
Russian corporates have nearly $100 billion of hard currency bonds outstanding, more than twice the $40 billion the Russian sovereign owes on international bond markets, according to data from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
More than 50% of the outstanding corporate bonds were issued by quasi-sovereigns or state-run firms, with a heavy skew toward oil and gas companies.
TEST PAYMENT 
The source close to Severstal said a ""test"" payment the company sent last week for its coupon for 2024 loan participation notes (LPN) has yet to be processed by  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), with the grace period set to expire on Wednesday.
Severstal said on March 16 that it would pursue alternative options to deliver the $12.6 million coupon payment in case the test - 1% of the coupon - is not processed. But it has not provided any further details so far.
Citi and Severstal declined to comment on the information given to Reuters by the source.

Evraz faced similar hurdles, with the company saying on Monday that a coupon payment of nearly $19 million was ""blocked for compliance"" by the correspondent bank. The company said it believed the issue was linked to sanctions.
On Tuesday, it said the paying agent had settled the relevant account.

(Reuters) -The deadly crash of a China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) 737-800 could set back Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s efforts to regain ground in the world's biggest aircraft market and deliver more than 140 737 MAX jets already constructed for Chinese customers.
The 737-800 that crashed on Monday does not have the equipment that led to 737 MAX crashes more than three years ago, but that may not make a difference to Chinese passengers and a national regulator known for scrupulous safety requirements.
China Eastern said the cause of the crash was under investigation. Such accidents typically involve multiple factors, and experts warned it was far too early to draw any conclusions on the potential causes, especially in light of the scarce information available.
China was the first country to ground the 737 MAX after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia more than three years ago, and it is the only major market where the MAX has not resumed commercial flights. 
A 737 MAX built for China Eastern subsidiary Shanghai Airlines took off from Seattle bound for Boeing's completion plant in Zhoushan last week, industry sources said, in a sign the model's return to service in China was close.
The plane landed in Guam on March 15 as part of a multi-leg journey and has not moved in the week since, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24.
The jet remains in Guam due to a ""minor technical issue"", according to a Boeing spokesperson who declined to provide further details. 
""Our team identified the issue and is working through the logistics to address it appropriately and resume the ferry flight when ready,"" the spokesperson added.
Robert Spingarn, a managing director at Melius Research who focuses on the aerospace sector, said the MAX's return in China could be delayed until authorities there had some answers on the cause of the China Eastern crash. China's aviation regulator is known for being very thorough on safety issues.
Chinese airlines do not need new MAX planes because demand is down following the country's biggest COVID-19 outbreaks in two years, industry sources said. But the U.S. manufacturer has more than 140 MAX jets already built for Chinese customers waiting to be delivered once the jet returns to commercial service there, a person familiar with the matter said.
Boeing's shares closed 3.6% lower on Monday. Boeing declined to comment on whether the crash could delay a business recovery in China, while China's aviation regulator did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
The 737-800 that crashed is an earlier model with a strong safety record and there are nearly 1,200 in service in China, making it the world's largest market for the plane, according to aviation consulting firm IBA. 
More than 4,200 737-800s are in service globally, data from aviation firm Cirium shows.
China Eastern and two of its subsidiaries on Monday grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes. The group has 225 of the aircraft, data from British aviation consultancy IBA shows.
Other Chinese carriers are continuing to fly the jets, according to data from Chinese aviation data provider Flight Master.
Jefferies analysts said China's aviation regulator was unlikely to ground the 737-800 fleet unless it specifically suspected a technical failure as the root cause because of the operational consequences of grounding more than 1,000 planes in the world's second-biggest domestic aviation market. 
However, there are concerns the Chinese public could look to avoid flying on 737-800s until the cause of the crash is determined, given the broader reputational issues with the 737 family caused by the MAX, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr said in a note.
""Hence, isolating the cause of the crash will be critical,"" he added, noting the leading causes of commercial air transport crashes tend to be maintenance issues, pilot error or sabotage, rather than manufacturing or design issues.

Boeing cancelled a meeting of its senior executives scheduled for this week in Miami to focus its attention on assisting the investigation and China Eastern, a second person familiar with the matter told Reuters.
""We have been in close communication with our customer and regulatory authorities since the accident, and have offered the full support of our technical experts to the investigation,"" Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in a memo to employees, which was seen by Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) workers in a cafe in Seattle, the coffee chain's hometown, voted 9 to 0 in favor of joining a labor union, according to a tally of ballots on Tuesday.
The results mark the seventh Starbucks-owned cafe in the United States to join the union, following five in Buffalo, New York and one in Mesa, Arizona. 
It is the first location in the company's own backyard to join Workers United. Baristas at more than 150 U.S. locations have petitioned a federal labor board for union elections since August, when the union drive went public.
The company runs about 9,000 U.S. locations, with thousands of others operated under licensing agreements.
The ballooning union drive comes during a nationwide labor crunch.
Some investors have asked Starbucks to adopt a neutral stance toward the union, noting that the company spent years building a reputation as an employee-friendly workplace.
""For a company that depends on a strong brand and customer loyalty, where people have an option to go somewhere else very easily, reputation is critical,"" said Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at Trillium Asset Management. 
Last week, Trillium and a group of other investors with $3.4 trillion under management asked Starbucks in a letter to stop sending anti-union communications to employees.

One unknown is what strategy the company will take when former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz steps in for outgoing Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson.
Schultz ""has a long history of not wanting to see Starbucks unionized,"" Kron said. ""But it is worth at least giving him an opportunity to make a pivot or to do a reset.""

Investing.com – Stocks rose on Tuesday, as investors absorbed words from Federal Reserve officials that indicated a more aggressive tightening was in the works as the central bank looks to conquer inflation.
All three indexes were higher heading into the close, with tech stocks helping the rebound. They closed down on Monday after Fed Chair Jerome Powell surprised markets by saying a bigger half-point increase in rates was in the cards. The Fed normally raises rates in quarter-point increments, as it did last week for the first time since the pandemic erupted.
The Fed is trying to quash inflation as Russia’s war with Ukraine threatens to exacerbate high energy and commodity prices and rising prices of food and other household essentials. 
President Joe Biden was set to travel to Brussels on Wednesday to meet with allies of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Union to discuss the West’s response to Russia, which continues to bomb civilian targets in Ukraine.
More sanctions will likely be announced at the NATO summit, the White House said Tuesday.
It’s a fairly light week for data and earnings. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow.
1. Nvidia outlook
On Tuesday, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) made numerous announcements surrounding its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin autonomous vehicle computer. 
It has started production of the Orin, while also showcasing new automakers adopting the NVIDIA DRIVE platform. The company also announced its automotive pipeline has increased to over $11 billion over the next six years. Analysts will be watching to see how the chipmaker rebounds from a global shortage of chips that affected production in the auto industry.
2. Travel stocks in focus
Just when people thought it was safe to travel again, Europe and Asia are seeing another wave of Covid-19 infections and there are concerns it will spread to the U.S., where many locations have only recently ended most of their restrictions and mandates. This doesn’t bode well for travel stocks. Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) already missed estimates for both earnings per share and revenue. The shares ended flat for the day, but investors will likely be watching the space closely.
3. Adobe earnings
Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) beat analysts' forecasts with earnings per share of $3.37 on revenue of $4.26 billion, but the shares dropped and will likely continue to be a focus on Wednesday. Adobe's subscription revenue came in at $3.96 billion. However, product revenue was $145 million, down 6.5% compared to the previous year.
Looking ahead, the company is targeting revenue of $4.34 billion in the second quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $3.30.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Treasury yields marched higher on Tuesday, bringing U.S. stocks with them, as investors digested the increased likelihood of swift interest rate hikes following hawkish comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 254.87 points, or 0.74%, to 34,807.86 and the S&P 500 gained 50.63 points, or 1.13%, to 4,511.81.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday the central bank could move ""more aggressively"" to raise rates to fight inflation, possibly hiking by more than 25 basis points at one or more meetings this year.
The market is pricing in a 72.2% probability that the Fed will hike the fed fund rate 50 basis points when policymakers meet in May, up from a probability of just over 50% on Monday.
At around 2000 GMT, or 4:00 p.m. ET, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.38%, having hit its highest level since 2019. The 2-year note also ticked up, to yield 2.16%, from 2.13%.
“The degree of difficulty for Jerome Powell’s Fed to stick a soft landing for the economy is about the same as Captain Sullenberger’s heroic emergency landing on the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River,"" said Aaron Clark, a portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management in Boston, referring to the 2009 landing of a US Airways plane after its engines failed. 
""The market remains in a tug of war between a policy error causing a recession and a resilient economy with a strong consumer and corporate sector,"" Clark wrote in an email.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was up approximately 1.1%.
Matthias Scheiber, global head of multiasset portfolio management at Allspring Global Investments in London, said the pickup in stocks could be a case of investors buying the dip, but that growth stocks would struggle if the U.S. 10-year yield moves closer to 2.5%.
""We saw the sharp rise in yields yesterday and we see that continuing today on the long end, so that’s likely to put pressure on equities. ... It will be hard for equities to have a positive performance.""
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) took a different view and said that 80% of its clients plan to increase equity exposure, which is a record high.
""With positioning light, sentiment weak and geopolitical risks likely to ease over time, we believe risks are skewed to the upside,"" JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note to clients.
""We believe investors should add risk in areas that overshot on the downside such as innovation, tech, biotech, EM/China, and small caps. These segments are pricing in a severe global recession, which will not materialize, in our view.""
The conflict in Ukraine continued to weigh on sentiment. Russia, the U.S. and Britain traded accusations at the United Nations on Tuesday over the possibility of a chemical weapons attack in Ukraine, but none produced any evidence to back their concerns.
Oil prices pulled back less than 1% on Tuesday as the dollar strengthened and it looked unlikely that the European Union would pursue an embargo on Russian oil, a day after prices jumped 7% and also rose earlier in the session.
The dollar edged lower on Tuesday as the boost from Powell's comments faded and a rise in equities markets help boost risk-on sentiment.

Spot gold dropped 0.7% to $1,921.73 an ounce, pressured by rising interest rates.
Cryptocurrency bitcoin was up about 3.25% at around $42,376, adding to gains since its intraday low of $34,324 on Feb. 24, when Russia invaded Ukraine.

Investing.com –  Stocks climbed Tuesday, as growth stocks sidestepped growing expectations for the Federal Reserve to turn more aggressive on rate hikes, while meme-stocks including GameStop returned to rally mode.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, or 254 points, the S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Nasdaq rose 1.9%.
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard stressed the need for the Fed to move faster and more aggressively on rate hikes to curb the pace of inflation.
The remarks arrived a day after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank would be prepared to hike by more than 25 basis points at upcoming meetings to “ensure a return to price stability.”
Wall Street was quick to price in steeper hikes following Powell’s comments, with Goldman Sachs now forecasting a 50 basis point hike at the Fed’s May and June meetings.
Regional banks paired some of their recent losses helping the broader financials sector rise more than 1% as rising rates boost the net interest margin of banks.
SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), and  First Republic Bank  (NYSE:FRC) led the move higher.
Growth sectors of the market including big tech didn’t waver under the pressure of the rising yields.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended the day in the green. 
Chinese tech stocks were also in the ascendency, supported by a surge in  Alibaba  Group (NYSE:BABA) after the e-commerce announced boosted its share buyback program to a record $25 billion.
JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) also rose on Tuesday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), meanwhile, jumped more than 7% after the electric vehicle maker officially opened its Gigafactory in Berlin. The move is expected to boost Tesla’s market share in Europe.
The opening of Giga Berlin “should further vault its [Tesla’s] market share within Europe over the coming years as more consumers aggressively head down the EV path,” Wedbush said in a note Monday.
On the earnings front,  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), a sizeable Dow Jones index component, rose more than 2% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results. 
“Recent results and commentary from senior leadership of the company show clearly that NKE is managing well various external headwinds, including ongoing supply chain distributions and geopolitical tensions, across the globe,” Oppenheimer said in a note. “We are optimistic that money will soon flow back into NKE shares.”
Energy stocks gave back some of their gains from a day earlier as oil prices turned negative on signs the European Union is unlikely to join the U.S. in banning Russian oil.
Tuesday also marked the return of retail investor appetite into the so-called meme stocks, with GameStop (NYSE:GME) surging 30%, AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) up 15% and  Express Inc  (NYSE:EXPR) up nearly 10%."

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher on Tuesday, recovering after the previous session’s weakness sparked by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell suggesting the central bank could lift interest rates more quickly than expected.
At 4:15 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 254 points or 0.7%, the S&P 500 rose 1%, and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.9%.
The three main indexes on Wall Street closed lower Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 200 points, or 0.6%, breaking a five-day winning streak, the S&P 500 fell marginally and the NASDAQ Composite declined 0.4% after Fed chief Powell vowed Monday to take the “necessary steps” to curb inflation.
“If we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,” Powell said.
The Fed raised the benchmark lending rate by a quarter point at its meeting last week, the first increase since December 2018.
Also helping the tone were strong numbers from  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), with the world’s biggest sportswear maker beating third-quarter revenue and profit expectations, helped by strong demand in North America. The retailer also stated that manufacturing issues that have hurt sales over the past six months were now behind it.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) unveiled its new European production hub in Germany earlier Tuesday, while  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) raised its share buyback program by $9 billion to $25 billion, the Chinese e-commerce giant’s largest ever repurchase plan.
Cruise operator Carnival (NYSE:CCL) reported a loss of $1.89 billion for the fiscal first quarter. Software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) will report after the closing bell.
Elsewhere, investors will keep a wary eye on developments in eastern Europe, with Russian troops continuing to bombard several Ukrainian cities, and the Black Sea port of Mariupol in particular.
Ukraine would hold a referendum on the terms of any peace agreement with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a televised interview late Monday.
The economic data slate Tuesday includes numbers from Redbook Research and the Richmond Fed.
Oil prices reversed an earlier drop on Tuesday and later fell back into the red while European Union governments continue to discuss joining the United States in sanctioning Russian oil in return for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities by Iranian-aligned Houthis over the weekend have also added jitters to the market.
By 4:16 PM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.9% lower at $108.97 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.5% to $115.03. Both contracts had settled up more than 7% on Monday.
U.S. crude oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute are due later in the day.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,920/oz.

379,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 03:56PM ET</span>",Ericsson CEO says he told staff to hand U.S. full Iraq report in 2019,"By Supantha Mukherjee
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) Chief Executive Borje Ekholm said on Tuesday he had told staff in 2019 to disclose to the U.S. Department of Justice all information on an investigation the company carried out that year into suspect payments in Iraq.
The Swedish telecoms equipment maker has been under scrutiny over possible payments to Islamic State after Ericsson said this month that U.S. authorities had determined it failed to make sufficient disclosures about its activities in Iraq before entering a deferred prosecution agreement in 2019.
""It's correct that I instructed to disclose fully to the DOJ and then of course we have an internal process ... I will not go into those details,"" Ekholm said on a call with shareholders, ahead of its annual general meeting on March 29.
The Ericsson board, including Chairman Ronnie Leten, has been backing Ekholm, after proxy firms including Glass Lewis had recommended shareholders vote to remove him following the disclosure and a sharp fall in the company's share price.
Ericsson had only submitted parts of its 77-page investigation in 2019 and not the entire report to the Justice Department, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 
The 2019 deal between Ericsson and the Justice Department was to resolve a probe into years of alleged corruption in China, Vietnam and Djibouti. Ericsson paid more than $1 billion in penalties and other fees to reach a settlement.
Ericsson disclosed its issues in Iraq last month, triggering a share price fall that wiped more than a third off its market value. It said its 2019 internal probe had identified payments designed to circumvent Iraqi customs at a time when militant organizations, including Islamic State, controlled some routes.
However, it did not disclose the findings of this probe to shareholders in 2019 and only released a statement in February after media enquiries, which led to questions over whether the Justice Department was aware of the investigation.
The Justice Department's notice earlier this month said that Ericsson did not properly disclose misconduct and compliance failures in Iraq.
The department was not immediately available for comment.
Since the Justice Department sent a notification of breach to Ericsson on March 2, the company has changed its Chief Legal Officer, replacing Xavier Dedullen with Scott Dresser. 
Dedullen did not respond to a request for comment.
Several shareholders raised concerns on Tuesday's call about whether any other probes were yet to be disclosed or any potential financial implication as a result of the Justice Department deal breach.

Ericsson executives said they are in talks with the department.
""We are going to do everything that we need to do to address any historical issues or that may come up in the review,"" said Dresser, who will oversee Ericsson's review over its conduct relating to Iraq and how it was addressed.

(Reuters) -Nike Inc said on Monday manufacturing issues pinching sales over the past six months were now behind it, positioning the company to take advantage of surging demand for sports shoes and apparel.
Shares of the world's biggest sportswear maker rose 5.9% to $137.90 in extended trading, as it also beat third-quarter revenue and profit estimates.
Pandemic-related factory closures last year in Vietnam, where about half of  Nike  (NYSE:NKE)'s footwear is made, and the slow return to normal production in the country led to a shortage of Nike, Jordan and Converse sneakers across most markets.
All Nike factories in Vietnam are now operational, with total footwear and apparel production in line with pre-closure volumes, the company's Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend said.
However, shipping delays were still a cause for concern for Nike, especially in North America where transit times have worsened, Friend added.
The company's North America revenue rose 9% in the third quarter, helped by sustained pandemic demand for athletic wear, return of school sports and price increases.
""As people returned to some sort of new normal, that still has involved a lot of outdoor activities like trail running, golf and tennis,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.
Revenue in Greater China fell 8% in the third quarter, as Nike was forced to prioritize sending its limited supplies to North America over the Chinese market.
The company said it was unclear what the impact of a fresh surge in COVID-19 cases in China would have on its fourth-quarter results.

Nike's revenue rose 5% to $10.87 billion in the quarter ended Feb. 28, while analysts had expected $10.59 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned 87 cents per share, beating estimates of 71 cents per share.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Monday struck an agreement to buy insurance company Alleghany (NYSE:Y) Corp for $11.6 billion, only weeks after the 91-year-old billionaire bemoaned a lack of good investment opportunities.
Alleghany, the owner of reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings Inc, would expand Berkshire's large portfolio of insurers, which includes auto insurer Geico, reinsurer General Re and a unit that insures against major catastrophes and unusual risks.
""Berkshire will be the perfect permanent home for Alleghany, a company that I have closely observed for 60 years,"" Buffett, who has run Berkshire since 1965, said in a statement.
The acquisition, one of the five largest in Berkshire's history, would reunite Buffett with Joseph Brandon, who led General Re from 2001 to 2008 and became Alleghany's chief executive in December.
It would also end Buffett's six-year drought of large acquisitions and help him to deploy some of the $146.7 billion of cash and equivalents his conglomerate had at the end of last year.
In his Feb. 26 annual shareholder letter, Buffett lamented that ""internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions"" and that little ""excites us"" in equity markets. He pledged to keep $30 billion cash on hand.
Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research in New York, said the merger should offer no surprises, reflecting Buffett's familiarity with Alleghany and Brandon.
""Berkshire has been under pressure to do a deal, and this may be the path of least resistance, though Alleghany will be a positive addition,"" she said.
""In terms of its business model and culture, this is a very strong fit.""
Berkshire agreed to pay $848.02 in cash per Alleghany share, representing a 25% premium over Friday's closing price.
Alleghany would operate as an independent unit of Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, Nebraska.
Shares of Alleghany closed up $167.85, or 24.8%, at $844.60 on Monday. Berkshire's Class A shares rose $12,009, or 2.3%, to $525,000, their highest-ever close.
'MINI-BERKSHIRE'
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory and Alleghany shareholder approvals.
Alleghany has a 25-day ""go-shop"" period to find a better offer. No break-up fee would be owed if the merger fell through.
Berkshire is known for its refusal to engage in bidding wars for whole companies.
Insurance typically generates more than 20% of operating profit at Berkshire, which has dozens of businesses including BNSF Railway, Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Dairy Queen ice cream and restaurant chain. 
Berkshire also invests hundreds of billions of dollars in stocks such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), and has this year invested more than $6.4 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY).
New York-based Alleghany was founded in 1929 by railroad entrepreneurs Oris and Mantis Van Sweringen and was transformed into an insurance and investment operating company under Fred Morgan Kirby (NYSE:KEX) II's leadership from 1967 to 1992.
CFRA Research's Seifert said Alleghany has long held itself out as a ""mini-Berkshire,"" being an insurance conglomerate that redeploys some of its excess capital in other businesses.
Buffett said the companies had ""many similarities,"" including what Brandon described in a letter to Alleghany's more than 13,000 employees as a ""shared philosophy of managing businesses for the long term.""
Alleghany's other units include RSUI Group Inc, an underwriter of wholesale specialty insurance, and CapSpecialty, which provides specialist cover for small and medium-sized businesses.

Its Alleghany Capital Corp owns several non-insurance businesses, including companies that focus on industrial parts, machine tools, hotels, toys and funeral services.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher advised Alleghany on the transaction. The law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson advised Berkshire.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy is looking to install two floating storage and regasification units (FSRU) to boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports as part of plans to cut reliance on Russian gas, Italy's energy transition minister said on Tuesday.
""Today we officially mandated (gas group) Snam to negotiate the acquisition of an FSRU and the leasing of a second,"" Roberto Cingolani said in a parliamentary hearing.
His comments confirmed sources who earlier told Reuters the two vessels, with a combined capacity of more than 10 billion cubic metres (bcm), would be located in the Tyrrhenian Sea and, probably, in the Adriatic Sea.
The vessels will be located in ports close to existing pipeline infrastructure, one of the sources said.
""The infrastructure... will be identified as strategic assets,"" Cingolani said.
Rome imports around 30 bcm of gas from Russia every year - some 40% of its total gas imports - and is looking to diversify its energy supplies in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Cingolani said earlier this month it would take at least three years to fully replace Russian imports but said 20 bcm could be replaced in the ""near to medium term"" through measures including using more LNG.
Italy is keen to increase LNG imports from markets like Qatar, the United States and Mozambique, but currently has just three LNG plants that account for around 20% of daily imports.
Talks are ongoing with FSRU providers though nothing has been concluded as yet, one of the sources said.
Snam, whose main shareholder is the state, runs Italy's gas transport network and most of the country's gas storage business. It also has LNG plant assets. 
Installing FSRUs is quicker than building fixed terminals but demand for vessels has risen sharply as governments across Europe scramble to find quick ways to secure more LNG cargoes.

Dutch network operator Gasunie is in talks with Germany to use FSRUs in the port town of Brunsbuettel, while the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey are said to be testing the market. 
""There are ambitions by governments to bring additional regasification capacities to Europe. We will see additional 6 FSRUs this winter,"" an industry source said.

388,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 02:13PM ET</span>",'Humble and hidden' auto suppliers driving the EV revolution,"By Nick Carey and Christoph Steitz
WOERT, Germany (Reuters) - The shift to electric cars may pose an existential threat to suppliers of combustion engines but for auto parts firms such as  TE Connectivity  (NYSE:TEL) the challenge is keeping up with demand.
It makes the connectors that link miles of cables in cars to all things electrical, from sensors to fuel injection systems to infotainment - and if there's anything the cars of an electric era will need, it's larger and ever more complex connectors.
That's why TE spent $125 million to open a new building in 2020 dedicated to electric vehicle (EV) parts at a factory tucked away in a shallow valley in the small town of Woert in southern Germany. 
And that's why it's on the lookout for acquisitions or partnerships to keep expanding its auto business, Chief Executive Terrence Curtin told Reuters: ""We're going to continue to add capacity.""
As legacy auto parts suppliers figure out if and when to sell combustion engine businesses or buy EV parts makers, TE and rivals in the connectors or sensors businesses such as Sensata Technologies,  Amphenol Corp  (NYSE:APH) and Molex are looking to supply higher-value components and do more development work with carmakers going through a massive transition.
""All these automakers talking about moving their fleets to electric and making promises about range are incapable of doing that without suppliers like TE,"" says William Kerwin, an analyst at Morningstar who covers TE, Sensata and Amphenol.
Auto parts account for over 40% of TE's $15 billion in revenue, making it one the biggest car suppliers most people have never heard of. Its $43 billion market value is far bigger than Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) combined - and more than three times heavyweight supplier Continental.
TE has a price-to-earnings ratio of about 18, Amphenol and Sensata are in the 20s, while Continental trades at about 10.
EUROPEAN DEMAND EXPLOSION
TE's Curtin said car parts suppliers and automakers alike had been caught out by an explosion in demand for EVs in Europe over the past two years - and with everyone playing catch-up TE's new facility was running at double its planned production.
While a global shortage of semiconductors has hit overall car production, Curtin said automakers have been using the chips they do have to prioritise EVs over fossil fuel vehicles - putting ever more strain on suppliers such as TE.
The challenge TE faces is getting the timing and scale of its expansion right, given the EV transition and shift to self-driving cars could run into speed bumps, such as an end to subsidies or safety concerns, Curtin said.
Because for TE, electrification means going bigger.
The far greater power needed by EVs means TE must develop larger and more complex components to handle the extra current, without causing fires.
TE's conventional parts have up to five components but its newer EV parts have up to 50 components. The supplier also now buys tonnes of aluminium, which is lighter and cheaper than copper, to make up portions of those larger parts.
In the older part of the Woert factory, machines spit out 16 connectors for fossil fuel cars a second. In the new building, more complex and costly machines, some supplied by Germany's Manz, crank out larger copper connectors with welded alloy springs for EV charge ports at a far slower pace.
TE also makes a large connector here that sits atop an EV battery module - an EV has up to 12 modules - and serves as its brain, measuring each battery cell's performance while a tiny semiconductor measures their temperature.
The new facility in Woert can make 2 million such connectors a year but demand continues to soar.
""We're going to need more,"" said Matthias Lechner, TE's head of Europe, Middle East and Africa, adding that TE planned to manufacture more at a plant in Hungary and elsewhere. 
Graphic: On the rise: https://graphics.reuters.com/ELECTRIC-VEHICLES/SALES/jnpwebrzwpw/chart.png 
Lechner, who describes TE as ""humble and hidden"", says its connectors can reduce EV charging time by 10 minutes, an edge carmakers can sell to consumers.
CEO Curtin says EVs and self-driving cars will double the value of the parts TE supplies from about $70 now for the average fossil fuel car. That means the payoff could be huge.
EVs almost doubled their global share of vehicle sales to 6% in 2021, according to research group JATO Dynamics, and that share is only set to rise.
Europe's auto supplier market will grow to 330 billion euros ($359 billion) in 2030 from 216 billion now, driven by software, EVs and electronics, McKinsey estimates, as firms tackle chip bottlenecks and cost pressure while investing in growth.
""We're observing a double transformation,"" McKinsey partner Timo Moeller said.
TE's Woert site employs 2,200 people and is adding more engineers and technicians, as well as different machines to make connectors for data in self-driving cars - because unlike EV parts, tiny connections are better for moving data.
TE has three auto parts factories in Germany and another five across Europe. Worldwide, it has 29 factories dedicated to its automotive business.
Morningstar's Kerwin said TE faces the same risks as others in a cyclical business such as the auto industry.
But he said TE had a ""sticky"" relationship with customers and has embedded engineers with carmakers to develop products for vehicles in an electric age.

""The writing is on the wall that you have to play into electrification if you want to succeed,"" Kerwin said.

LONDON (Reuters) - France's Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) said on Tuesday it had suspended all services in Russia, joining a retreat by other international banks since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Credit Agricole, which had previously stopped new financing for Russian companies, said in a statement it had contacted international corporate clients to begin suspending services.
The bank had previously said its exposure to Russia and Ukraine was around 6.4 billion euros ($7.05 billion) in on and off balance sheet items, but told investors that its 2021 dividend would not be impacted.
Banks and investors have rushed to cut links to Russia in recent weeks, amid heavy Western sanctions against Moscow.
Credit Agricole added that its priority was helping to support its 2,400 employees in Ukraine, who were helping ensure essential banking activities continued despite being ""struck at full force by the war"". 
The move comes a day after French rival BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) said it had informed its corporate clients in Russia that it would no longer process their transactions after the end of month, after previously stopping new financing in Russia.
Ratings agency S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) said earlier it had suspended services of all products to customers in Russia and Belarus who are subject to sanctions.

Meanwhile, two thirds of funds in Luxembourg with heavy Russian exposure have been suspended since the Ukraine invasion, which Moscow has said is a ""special military operation"", the Grand Duchy's securities regulator said.

(Reuters) -Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd will resume operations on Tuesday as it agreed to settle a labor dispute with the union representing its conductors and engineers through arbitration, averting more pain to firms battling supply-chain disruptions.
The railroad said the agreement with Teamsters Canada Rail Conference ends the work stoppage that began early Sunday when it locked its workers out over a dispute on pensions, pay and benefits.
That sparked calls for quick negotiations over fears it could aggravate a shortage of commodities caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Canada is the world's biggest producer of potash, a key ingredient for producing nitrogen-containing fertilizers, followed by Russia and Belarus.
A binding arbitration typically involves an employer and a union presenting their demands before an independent arbitrator, whose decision on contract terms is final.
""While arbitration is not the preferred method, we were able to negotiate terms and conditions that were in the best interest of our members,"" union spokesperson Dave Fulton said.
Canada's Minister of Labour Seamus O'Regan Jr, who mediated the talks, said normal operations will continue at CP during the arbitration period. 
The agreement comes as global supply chain woes hamper the rail sector and industries that depend on it to transport everything from cars to coal.
""We are obviously relieved but even a strike of short duration has impacts and is costly,"" Chief Executive of the Mining Association of Canada Pierre Gratton said.
Canada depends heavily on rail to move commodities and manufactured goods to ports. CP's network runs across much of southern Canada and extends as far south as Kansas City in the United States.

The country's last major railway labour disruption was an eight-day Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co strike in 2019.
""Rail should be deemed an essential service under the Canada Labour Code and subjected to binding arbitration to resolve disputes in all cases,"" Western Grain Elevator Association, the organization that handles a bulk of Canada's bulk grain export, said.

(Reuters) -Carnival Corp on Tuesday forecast a loss for the year as the U.S. cruise operator's efforts to gradually restart operations after a long pandemic-led hiatus face a setback from a surge in fuel prices due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.
Analysts expect rising fuel costs to temper near-term operating results. Jefferies estimates fuel costs to be 8-10% higher than previously anticipated for the first half of 2022, and 10-11% higher for the second half.
""It's certainly not the first time we've seen a dramatic spike in fuel prices ... (we) are stepping up our efforts to further reduce consumption,"" Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said on a post-earnings call.
Carnival, which had expected to return to positive monthly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) in the second quarter, now expects adjusted EBITDA to turn positive in the summer. 
The company reiterated a net loss for the second quarter as higher fuel costs were having a ""material impact"" on its business, but forecast a return to profit in the third quarter as it resumes to full capacity and booking trends improve. 
Shares of Carnival fell about 1.5% to $18.67 after the company also posted lower-than-expected first-quarter revenue as Omicron dented bookings.
While Carnival did not provide a detailed full-year forecast,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said the Q1 miss and higher fuel costs suggest ""forecasts will be coming down again."" 

Excluding items, the company posted a loss of $1.66 per share, compared with analysts' expectation of a loss of $1.26, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
In the wake of the Ukraine conflict, the company has already modified its trips to avoid stopping at Russian ports in the summer, and will also withdraw from any halts in the country for the remainder of the year, it added on Tuesday.

399,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 12:51PM ET</span>","Exclusive-Petroperu to miss deadline for financial audit, seeks bondholder reprieve","By Marco Aquino
LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's embattled state-owned oil firm Petroperu will not submit its annual financial audit before the end of July, new Chief Executive Francisco de la Torre told Reuters on Tuesday, meaning it will miss a key May deadline to present the document. 
Petroperu was downgraded earlier this month to junk by credit agencies after accounting firm PwC declined to audit the company's financial statements in the middle of a corporate governance crisis.
Petroperu has yet to find a new auditor to look at its 2021 financial statements and it is seeking bids through April 5, said de la Torre. 
""The optimistic scenario (to complete the audit) is for late July, the conservative scenario is for late August and the pessimistic scenario is for late September,"" said de la Torre, who took on the CEO role on Tuesday on a temporary basis. 
Petroperu's bonds have fallen since the Feb. 28 news that PwC had declined to carry out the audit on the grounds that the auditor could face risks if it did so.
The bonds include covenants that Petroperu must file its audit by May, otherwise it could trigger a technical default. De la Torre said he has offered  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) a contract to win over Petroperu bondholders so they waive the audit requirement.
Petroperu has issued bonds for $3 billion, including a recent $1 billion issuance to finish the construction of a new refinery in northern Peru. It also has an outstanding $1.3 billion loan with Spanish Export Credit Agency (CESCE). 
Under the left-wing administration of President Pedro Castillo, Petroperu has resumed oil production for the first time in decades, although at minimal levels.
Castillo is under pressure to lower fuel prices, which have spiked since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Peru imports the majority of the fuel that it consumes.
Petroperu's previous CEO Hugo Chavez resigned on Sunday amid allegations that he had improperly hired a company to provide him with personal security. He was replaced by de la Torre, who was serving as chief financial officer.
De la Torre said his next priority at the company would be to recover its investment grade, which was lost this month over the tensions with PwC. The firm has also been criticized for significant executive turnover.
""What had been going around financial circles is that people were saying that audit firms did not feel comfortable enough to audit Petroperu while Chavez was in charge,"" de la Torre said.
""Since that has now changed ... we hope that sentiment has changed too.""

Prosus runs Avito as part of its OLX business, which is one of the world's biggest online marketplaces.
""Our Avito classifieds site in Russia hosts around 90 million active adverts and moderates around 5 million new listings every day,"" Prosus said in a statement. 
""We were made aware of a small number of job adverts for military vacancies that had been posted on Avito, and this has now been addressed.""
It did not give details of the jobs.
A Prosus spokesperson said the job adverts had been put up by the Russian military.
Prosus drew criticism on social media for the job adverts from some Ukrainians angry that the Dutch company was allowing the Russian military to recruit on Avito.
Prosus has said it was ""appalled"" by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow says is a ""special military operation"". However, the Dutch company decided to continue Avito's operations, which employ 4,000 people in Russia.
""For us to rush out and leave those people without their livelihoods in the short term feels like the absolute wrong thing to do,"" CEO Bob van Dijk told investors on March 7.
Before the war Avito was valued at around $6 billion. The company said it could not provide forecasts, but Avito's profitability and valuation will be affected by the conflict, given the plunge in value of the Russian rouble.

Separately, Prosus has written off the entire value of its 27% stake in VK Group, the Russian social media platform whose London-listed shares were suspended following a U.S. decision to impose sanctions on its chief executive.
Prosus is part of a cross-holding entity with Naspers of South Africa, with the two companies sharing a single board.

Investing.com -- BuzzFeed Inc (NASDAQ:BZFD) shares are trading higher Tuesday after revenue beat consensus expectations.
The company announced earnings per share of $0.01 on revenue of $145.7 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $0.04 on revenue of $133.94 million.
However, it was revealed soon after that three of the company's top editors, including editor-in-chief Mark Schoofs will be stepping down due to an internal announcement about impending job cuts. 
According to the New York Times, BuzzFeed will cut around 1.7% of its workforce.
Reports stated that the company's CEO Jonah Peretti announced cuts across the BuzzFeed video and editorial teams alongside reductions in the business and administrative teams.
“I’m emailing early to share that we are also completing the integration of Complex Networks today, which sadly means that we will part with some colleagues in the Admin and Business organizations,” the NYT quoted Peretti as saying in his note to employees.
Adding: “Although this is always a difficult thing to do, it is essential to unify the business organizations and admin teams from BuzzFeed and Complex Networks in order to realize the opportunities that merging our strong brands offers.”"

""Volvo Cars' expectation has been to grow its sales volumes for the full year 2022,"" the company said in a statement. ""The disturbance means the company now expects marginal growth in deliveries for the full year 2022, compared to 2021.""
Volvo, majority owned by China's Geely Holding, said the problems were not related to the war in Ukraine, but that fighting there had resulted in increasing costs for raw material, energy and freight. 
""Volvo Cars continue to work with pricing to mitigate the effects,"" it said.

A global semiconductor chip shortage has slowed car makers' production lines despite recovery from the effects of the pandemic.
In February, Volvo said supply chain bottlenecks would remain a restraining factor, while the component shortage would only gradually improve.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Activist investor Enkraft is demanding a shareholder vote to force RWE to prepare a spin-off of its brown coal unit at the utility's annual general meeting (AGM) next month, according to a filing made public on Tuesday.
Enkraft, which owns a stake in RWE that is large enough to request items be put on the AGM's agenda, has for months lobbied for such a move, and while there is general consensus about the necessity to phase out coal, both sides differ over strategy.
RWE said it has added Enkraft's motion to the AGM's agenda.
""On several occasions Enkraft has tried to persuade the company's Executive Board to immediately leverage this potential,"" Enkraft said in the motion that was made public on RWE's website.
""The persistent inactivity of the board is no longer justifiable and is unacceptable.""
RWE said it would soon publish its response to Enkraft's request.
According to the filing, Enkraft is asking management to ""prepare draft agreements or plans corresponding reports for the lawful spin-off"" of RWE's subsidiary RWE Power AG, which includes the utility's brown coal activities.
RWE's next AGM is scheduled for April 28.
If approved, the documents should then be submitted at the latest by the next ordinary AGM - which would take place in 2023 - for ""adoption of a resolution,"" the filing said.
Enkraft reckons that spinning off lignite generation would remove a discount on RWE shares that puts it behind pure play renewables firms, adding such a move could add more than 16 billion euros ($17.6 billion) to the firm's market value.

RWE has said that phasing out coal cannot be done via brute force, adding the impact on jobs and regional economies had to be taken into account and proposing a smoother and less abrupt exit.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) -Embattled China Evergrande Group will unveil a debt restructuring proposal for its creditors by the end of July, it said on Tuesday, after concerns about its financial health were renewed by a delay in publishing its annual results.
Evergrande, whose $22.7 billion worth of offshore debt is deemed to be in default, is seeking to ""further enhance communications"" with creditors to reach the end-July target, its executive director Siu Shawn told investors on a call.
Earlier on Tuesday, Evergrande said in a stock exchange filing it would not meet a March 31 deadline to file its financial results for 2021 because audit work had not been completed.
The world's most indebted property developer, Evergrande told investors in January it aimed to have a preliminary restructuring proposal in place within six months. 
A wave of defaults in China's property sector has rattled investors and while state intervention has quelled market concern over a disorderly collapse of Evergrande, investors are still in the dark over whether they will recoup their money.
Evergrande, once China's top-selling developer and now reeling under more than $300 billion in liabilities, defaulted on some overseas bond payments in December and has struggled to repay suppliers and creditors and complete projects and homes.
The developer set up a risk management committee in December made up mostly of members from state enterprises, as the Guangdong provincial government is leading the restructuring.
""With the broad support and understanding from the majority of creditors ... we strive to release the preliminary restructuring proposal by the end of July,"" Chen Yong, a member of the committee, told investors.
As part of its plans to divest assets to repay some of its offshore debt, the developer is working to sell its Yuen Long land parcel in Hong Kong as well as the Evergrande Centre commercial building, said Evergrande board member Liang Senlin.
Trading in shares of Evergrande, its property services unit Evergrande Property Services Group Ltd, and electric vehicle unit China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd have been suspended since Monday.
Liang said on the investor call the developer was trying to rope in strategic investors in both the electric vehicle and property services units to restore value - a goal it has been pursuing for roughly a year without much success.
Siu said the EV unit aimed to start mass production in June of its inaugural electric car, the Hengchi 5 sport-utility vehicle, after getting approval to start sales last week.
Some of the investors who attended the call were not impressed with the assurances from management.
""They mainly explained why the trading of stocks is suspended. There was no new information and the situation remained the same,"" said a bondholder who was on the call, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
A MODEL TO FOLLOW? 
Earlier on Tuesday, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Evergrande planned to return land used as collateral for a trust loan to the Guangzhou government, providing a model for local authority involvement that could be replicated for other indebted Chinese property firms.
The deal centres around a 3.25 billion yuan ($510.73 million) trust loan that CITIC Trust issued to Evergrande using funds raised from investors, according to the sources and a document reviewed by Reuters partially outlining the plan.
Under the plans, CITIC will return the land used as collateral to Evergrande, which will then pass it on to the Guangzhou city government to put up for sale, the sources said.
State-owned Guangzhou City Construction Investment group will act as a guarantor of the loan and CITIC will repay the principal amount to its investors within two years using funds from the Guangzhou city government, the sources said. 
The plan is still pending approval from the investors of the trust loan, one of the people said.
If successfully implemented, this model of local government and creditors working together to resolve Evergrande's debt repayment issue could be replicated for other trust loans, analysts said, and more state-owned city investment companies may become involved in the firm's debt restructuring process.
Evergrande, CITIC and Guangzhou City Construction Investment did not respond to requests for comment.
Trust companies, which pool money from wealthy investors, are an important source of funding for Evergrande and other property developers in China. 
In a separate filing on Tuesday, Evergrande said its Property Services Group had launched an investigation into how banks seized 13.4 billion yuan in deposits that had been pledged as security for third party guarantees.

The seizure of the funds, which the property services unit discovered when it was preparing its annual report, underscores the turmoil at Evergrande, which said it would hire King & Wood Mallesons as an additional legal adviser.

410,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 11:14AM ET</span>",Antibodies in children last at least 6 mos after COVID; SK Bioscience vaccine shows promise vs Omicron,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) -The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
Antibodies in kids after COVID last 6 months or more
Most children and adolescents with COVID-19 antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection usually still have the antibodies in their blood more than half a year later, new data shows.
Starting in October 2020, researchers in Texas recruited 218 subjects between the ages of 5 and 19. Each provided three blood samples, at three-month intervals. More than 90% were unvaccinated when they enrolled in the study. The first blood test showed infection-related antibodies indicating recovery from COVID-19 in one-third of the children, the researchers reported online Friday in Pediatrics https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2021-055505/185412/Durability-of-SARS-CoV-2-Antibodies-From-Natural. Six months later, 96% of those with the antibodies still had them. The study was designed to detect the presence of antibodies, which are only one component of the immune system's defenses, not the amount of antibodies. The level of protection even in those with antibodies is unclear. Researchers found no differences based on whether a child was asymptomatic, severity of symptoms, when they had the virus or due to weight or gender.
""It was the same for everyone,"" Sarah Messiah of UTHealth School of Public Health Dallas, said in a statement. ""Some parents... think just because their child has had COVID-19, they are now protected and don't need to get the vaccine,"" Messiah said. ""We have a great tool available to give children additional protection by getting their vaccine.""
A small study published earlier this month in JAMA Network Open https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789845 suggested that most children infected with the coronavirus do not have antibodies in their blood afterward. Only 37% of children appeared to develop antibodies, compared to 76% of adults, even though viral loads were similar in the two groups, those researchers found. 
Experimental SK vaccine shows promise against Omicron
A booster shot of an experimental vaccine being developed by SK Bioscience Co has shown ""durable protection"" against the Omicron variant in Rhesus macaques, according to new data.
The monkeys had received two initial doses of the vaccine plus a booster 6 or 12 months later. Blood samples from the boosted primates showed ""remarkably high"" levels of antibodies that could neutralize both the original strain of the virus and the Omicron variant that caused infections to soar, the researchers reported on Sunday on bioRxiv https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.18.484950v1 ahead of peer review. The animals' second-line immune defenses were also ""substantial and persistent,"" they said. The vaccine, called GBP510, triggers responses from the immune system by delivering copies of a key part of the spike protein from the surface of the coronavirus. The protein ""subunits"" are studded onto nanoparticles to resemble the virus itself. These components are supplemented with an adjuvant from GSK that boosts the immune system's responses, explained Bali Pulendran of Stanford University in California.
""Vaccination with two doses... followed a year later by a booster shot... plus adjuvant, led to highly durable antibody responses and protection against Omicron infection, even six months later,"" Pulendran said. Large late-stage trials of GBP510 in humans are underway. 
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) drug less protective vs Omicron in transplant patients
The AstraZeneca antibody shots given to prevent COVID-19 in high-risk children and adults with weakened immune systems do not adequately protect organ transplant recipients from the Omicron variant, researchers found.
The drug, Evusheld, did protect against the Delta variant in kidney transplant recipients, and lab test results released on Monday show Evusheld can neutralize Omicron in mice, including the highly contagious BA.2 version. But among 416 kidney recipients treated with Evusheld after Omicron became the predominant variant, 9.4% developed symptomatic breakthrough infections, with one-in-three of those patients requiring hospitalization, researchers reported on Saturday on medRxiv https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.19.22272575v1 ahead of peer review. Two patients died of COVID-19. In lab experiments, the researchers exposed the BA.1 version of Omicron that caused the massive winter surge to blood samples from 15 Evusheld-treated patients. None of the samples could neutralize the virus.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently advised https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-authorizes-revisions-evusheld-dosing that higher doses of Evusheld are likely needed to prevent Omicron infections, and that patients who received the originally approved shots should receive booster doses. The researchers said kidney transplant recipients ""should be advised to maintain sanitary protection measures and undergo vaccine boosters.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Tech giant SAP and Boston Consulting Group said on Tuesday they would team up to help some of the world's biggest companies overhaul their business strategy and accelerate their efforts to cut carbon emissions. 
While thousands of companies https://unfccc.int/climate-action/race-to-zero-campaign have pledged to cut their planet-warming emissions by the middle of the century, emissions across the economy continue to rise, leaving the world on course to suffer the catastrophic impacts caused by climate change.
Despite policymakers pushing companies to get a better grip on the environmental impact of their supply chains, including in Europe through the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_1145 directive, most companies are some way from being able to do so.
In a recent study https://www.bcg.com/en-gb/press/13october2021-only-nine-percent-of-organizations-measure-emissions-comprehensively, just 9% of executives from 1,290 companies surveyed by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) said they were able to fully measure their emissions.
To help fix the problem, SAP, which counts 85 of the world's 100 biggest companies as customers, and BCG said they would combine their carbon tracking and measurement technology and services to help inform clients' decision making.
""Being sustainable requires coordination across the value chain, and this is where SAP’s partnership with BCG plays a key role,"" SAP Chief Executive Christian Klein said in a statement.

(Reuters) - Sandbox AQ, which has long-term goals to help clients use quantum computing, announced on Tuesday that it has spun off from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, raised ""nine figures"" of funding and signed several clients for its cybersecurity services.
With the large funding and former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt as its chairman, Sandbox AQ is one of the highest-profile startups pursuing software that would operate at least partially on quantum computers.
Though unreliable and costly now, quantum computers could within a decade boost the power of artificial intelligence and other tools by crunching data millions of times faster than supercomputers. 
Sandbox AQ's initial sales are coming from software that runs on classical computers but tries to block quantum machines from someday unlocking standard encryption and exposing sensitive communications. Customers include New York's Mount Sinai Health System and telecoms providers Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Business and SoftBank Mobile.
Mount Sinai President David Reich told Reuters that Sandbox would over the next year assess the encryption in the health system's messaging tools and propose potential algorithm upgrades.
Schmidt said in an interview that converting large organizations to quantum-secure communications would be ""a pretty big business.""
In addition, Sandbox is nearing deals to sell quantum simulation software to potentially accelerate development of drugs and materials, CEO Jack Hidary said. Projects that could be commercialized over the next three years include using AI to analyze data from quantum-based sensors to improve medical imaging and also enable navigation by tracking magnetic fields instead of GPS satellites, he added.
Some of the team and inspiration for Sandbox originated at Alphabet in 2016. But the Google parent will not be a shareholder. Hidary said he wanted outside investors to help speed growth. The company will use cloud computing from Google Cloud and others.
Alphabet said it was ""pleased to help Jack to transition to an independent company.""
Investors include Schmidt, Breyer Capital, T. Rowe Price funds and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) founder Marc Benioff's TIME Ventures. Hidary declined to specify the amount of funding, saying he wanted attention instead to be on the technology.

The Palo Alto, California-based company has 55 employees and will spend the new funding on hiring.
Hidary said the company had prioritized increasing racial, gender and other diversity and was working to bring in residents from University of California Merced, not commonly known as a tech powerhouse, as one way to reach its goal.

The analyst also cut the price target to $75.00 per share, down from $110.00. 
Chiaverini cites weakening delinquency trends on recent 2021 vintage securitizations that appear to be deteriorating at a faster pace than its 2018, 2019, and 2020 vintages; the company has yet to operate through a true recession which means its underwriting model has yet to be battle-tested.
As a result, Upstart stock price is down nearly 10% today to push YTD losses to over 20%.
We fear that weakening delinquency trends combined with macro-and geopolitical risks could lead to waning appetite from Upstart's credit buyers and the securitization market. The biggest risk to Upstart, in our view, is its reliance on third-party funding, and this risk tends to become exacerbated during recessions and market turmoil, the beginnings of which could be in process of unfolding, the analyst added.

Speaking at a conference call to discuss fourth-quarter results, management said JBS will benefit from strong U.S. domestic demand for food products and steady meat trade flows to Asian markets, especially China.
JBS shares rose 2.5% in early trading after it said it earned $1.31 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts expectations.
In Brazil, where the company is headquartered, cost pressure will continue to weigh on the Seara division as meat processors scramble to buy corn used as feed. 
The scarcity during the inter-harvest period for corn, which will last through the middle of the year, is compounded by the war in Ukraine, which has caused grain prices to spike globally, affecting operations across all geographies.
Seara, which processes pork and poultry, has been unable to pass on higher costs onto consumers in Brazil, management said citing the weakness of Brazil's economy. In the United States on the other hand, consumers have the purchasing power to continue buying, executives said. 
Citing USDA data for 2022, JBS managers said beef and pork production will fall from the previous year in the United States, while poultry output will likely rise. 
In the United States, where the company derives most of its revenue, the outlook for prices and margins remains positive. In Australia, herds are still recovering but the outlook is improving.

On Monday, JBS reported record sales last year on the back of the strength of its U.S. business, which is also buoyed by strong trade ties with China.
Regarding acquisitions JBS made in 2021, the company said companies acquired are performing better than expected.

419,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 10:07AM ET</span>","Carnival Misses Earnings, Revenue Estimates","By Sam Boughedda
Investing.com -- Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) reported earnings Tuesday before the open, missing analyst estimates for both earnings per share and revenue.
The cruise line stock initially fell in the aftermath of the report, however, it is now up 1.3% on the day after regaining those early losses, which saw it open the session at $18.64.
Carnival announced earnings per share of -$1.66 on revenue of $1.62 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of -$1.22 on revenue of $2.3 billion.
In the company's cruise segments, revenue per passenger cruise day for the quarter increased around 7.5% compared to 2019. Carnival said this was due to ""exceptionally strong"" onboard and other revenue.
As of March 22, Carnival said 75% of its capacity had resumed guest cruise operations, with each of its brand's full fleet back in guest cruise operations for its respective summer season, when it believes monthly adjusted EBITDA will then turn positive.
""Since the middle of January, the company has seen an improving trend in weekly booking volumes for future sailings. Recent weekly booking volumes have been higher than at any point since the restart of guest cruise operations,"" stated Carnival.
Carnival Corporation President and CEO Arnold Donald stated: ""Given the recent strengthening in booking volumes coupled with the closer-in booking patterns, we expect an extended wave season. In fact, we gained occupancy even in the month of March with fleetwide occupancy nearing 70 percent and several sailings already exceeding 100 percent.""
""Since the middle of January, the company has seen an improving trend in weekly booking volumes for future sailings. Recent weekly booking volumes have been higher than at any point since the restart of guest cruise operations.""
Looking ahead, Carnival said the ongoing resumption of its guest cruise operations and the increased uncertainty given the current invasion of Ukraine, including its effect on the price of fuel, are having a material impact on its business.
Therefore, they see a net loss for the second quarter. However, the company expects a profit for Q3, but a full year 2022 net loss."

The slashed price target on COIN shares reflects conservative out-year margins and a higher discount rate.
Margins are pressured by the companys plans to ramp investments in 2023, which will directly hit EBITDA margins. On the other hand, the acceleration in spending is likely to offer an additional tailwind to MTU growth.
We agree with the move and see increased tech/product development spending translating to new features and functions (i.e. anticipated NFT platform) that will help drive further differentiation vs. less capitalized exchange peers. While recent crypto volatility has likely hampered transaction activity YTD, we assume strong Subscription and Services growth, primarily in Blockchain Rewards (staking), improving the revenue mix in 2023, Christiansen said in a client note.
The analyst also took note of declining crypto trading volumes, down roughly 20% in January and February compared to December. On a more positive note, COINs share of total volume has likely improved ~50bps to ~10%. 
Coinbases web traffic has declined in line with overall volume trends, although Coinbase app usage has only modestly contracted over the same period. Despite a successful post-Super Bowl pop, Coinbase downloads declined from 2.7mn in January to 1.6mn in February. Illustrated within, the mix of Coinbase Pro traffic declined modestly (Total Web Traffic ~20% to ~19%, Web Unique Traffic 10% to 9%, App MAUs flattish near 5-6%), which we think should bode well for a sequential improvement in combined spreads for 1Q21 results, the analyst added.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, with bank stocks, in particular, responding well to hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that pointed to a faster pace of monetary tightening in the next couple of months.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 213 points, or 0.6%, at 34,766 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.6% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.7%. All three indices finished lower on Monday, reversing earlier gains after Powell warned that inflation was ""much too high"" and that the Fed “may well reach the conclusion that we need to move more quickly.”
Goldman Sachs analysts told clients in a morning note that they now expect 50 basis point hikes at each of the Fed's next two policy meetings in May and June, followed by quarter-point hikes in each of the Fed meetings in the second half of the year. Bond yields, which shot higher in response to the news on Monday, continued to rise on Tuesday, gaining around 5 basis points all along the curve.
That movement supported bank stocks, in particular, for whom higher bond yields generally presage wider lending margins. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock rose 3.8% in early dealings, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock rose 2.9%.
The news also supported companies with relatively low levels of leverage and high cash balances. Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) stock, already in vogue after Monday's agreement to buy insurance-heavy conglomerate Alleghany (NYSE:Y), rose another 1.1%.
Another stock to stand out in early trade was  Nike  (NYSE:NKE). The world's biggest sportswear maker rose 5.8% to its highest in three weeks after reporting earnings that suggested it had overcome the worst of COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, even though the report bore out fears that it's suffering from a backlash against its products in China.
Elsewhere,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs rose 10.8% to their highest in five weeks after the Chinese e-commerce giant raised its share buyback program by $9 billion to $25 billion. The ADRs have lost nearly two-thirds of their value in the last five months, one of the biggest paper losses of all time, but have started to attract more favorable comments from an analyst community that increasingly thinks that the regulatory risks facing the company are now adequately priced in.
Rival Chinese e-commerce company  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) saw its ADRs also rise by 10.8%, thanks mainly to better-than-expected operating results in the latest quarter.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock meanwhile rose 1.4% as the company started deliveries from its new factory in Germany, eight months after its original start date. The start of production comes at an opportune time, when its Shanghai factory, which has been used to export to the European market, is facing ongoing interruptions to its business from mass COVID-19 testing both on-site and in important logistics centers around the factory."

Initially planned for November last year, the launch of the new model had been delayed due to a global chip shortage.
Maserati, the luxury brand of Stellantis, said the Grecale would be available in the second half of this year in three versions, two 300- and 330-horse-powered four-cylinder mild hybrids, as well as a high performance 530-horse powered petrol V6 capable of a top speed of 285 kilometres per hour.
Chief Executive Davide Grasso has said deliveries would start in the summer for the EMEA region and will follow right after in the United States.
With a length of 4.859 meters and a starting selling price ranging from around 74,000 to 111,000 euros ($81,000-$122,000), the Grecale will compete with models including Porsche's Cayenne and Macan, Mercedes' GLE, BMW's X5 and Land Rover's Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA).
A full-electric version of the car will be available next year, widening the pool of potential competitors to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
Taking its name from a wind, like its elder sister Maserati Levante, the Grecale will be produced in Stellantis' Cassino plant, in central Italy.
Maserati aims to offer a so-called 'Folgore' full-electric version of each model - including the over 200,000 euro super sport car MC20 - by 2025 and to be entirely full-electric by 2030.

Its first battery electric vehicle (BEV) will be the new GranTurismo, due to debut before the Grecale in 2023.

""In 2021 we experienced a very complex situation,"" Xiaomi president Wang Xiang said in an earnings call.
""Supply is in a very severe or tight position, and there is a geopolitical impact. However, Xiaomi's performance has shown we are a resilient company.""
Revenue rose to 85.58 billion yuan ($13.45 billion) in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with 70.46 billion yuan in the year earlier period and analyst expectations for 81.80 billion yuan, according to Refinitiv data.
Smartphone shipments rose 4.4% to 44.1 million units in the quarter, Xiaomi said in a statement.
Net income rose 39.6% to 4.47 billion yuan, also above analyst expectations. 
In an earnings call, Wang said that ensuring a steady supply of chips was still challenging in the first quarter of 2022, but expected the situation to improve by June.
The company, which gets the vast majority of its revenue from selling mobile handsets, said smartphone revenue rose 18.4% to 50.5 billion yuan ($7.94 billion) in the quarter ended Dec. 31. 
Last year, Xiaomi grabbed market share in its home market China away from Huawei, which lost its smartphone momentum after the United States placed export restrictions on its suppliers. But Huawei spinoff Honor came back strong in the second half of 2021, finishing the fourth quarter with a 16% market share in China - the same as Xiaomi - according to data from Canalys.
Xiaomi's fourth-quarter smartphone shipments in China rose 10%, according to research firm Canalys. Globally, its shipments rose 5%.
Slowing handset demand in China, the company's largest market, has prompted Xiaomi to look for new opportunities.
The company is slated to invest $10 billion over the next ten years into making electric cars, which it hopes to bring to market by 2024. 
The company has also ramped up investments in chips, relasing its first device with a self-developed image signal processor. 
Wang said that investments in chips would go into areas ""directly related to user experience,"" such as fast charging.
Xiaomi has also expanded its brick-and-mortar retail footprint, in hopes of attracting more customers.

Xiaomi reported a 33.5% rise in 2021 revenue, which hit 328.3 billion yuan ($51.59 billion), versus an average analyst estimate of 325.862 billion yuan.

Sunak is likely to announce a “relatively modest” increase in defense spending, in line with inflation, after security became a priority for British voters following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month, analysts Charles Armitage and Samuel Burgess wrote in a note Tuesday.
“The public desire for the government to take some sort of action will register very clearly,” the analysts said. “With the Labour Party also calling for a rise in defense spending, the government is unlikely to want to look weak on this issue.”
However, with the Chancellor attempting to manage an escalating cost-of-living crisis, significant changes will likely not be announced until the Autumn budget, Citi said. “Sunak may feel that, irrespective of the political capital defense increases may generate for the government, it will soon be eroded if inflation gets out of control.”
Among companies, QinetiQ Group Plc and BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) Plc would likely be the biggest beneficiaries of a U.K. defense spending uplift, while Italy’s Leonardo SpA (LON:0ONG) and France’s  Thales  (PA:TCFP) also have exposure, Citi said. Defense shares have outperformed the broader market this year, with the MSCI Europe Aerospace and Defense Index gaining 0.7% versus a more than 6% decline for the Stoxx Europe 600.

(Reuters) -  Robinhood Markets  Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) on Tuesday launched a new debit card that would allow spare change investing as it looks to expand beyond trading and into more consumer finance verticals, heating up competition with fintech giants Chime and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).
With the new cash card, users could choose to round up their change to the nearest dollar and invest it in assets of their choice, Robinhood said. 
The company, known as a pioneer of commission-free trading, would also reward users of this feature with a weekly bonus, it said. The card is being offered by Robinhood Money, a new subsidiary of the online brokerage.
Other consumer finance apps like Chime and Acorns Grow Inc also allow spare change investing, a feature that lets users invest small amounts of money and is particularly appealing to younger consumers.
""The younger generation is debit card-primary, so that is a primary focus,"" said Robinhood's Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada, adding that the company was trying to capitalize on the consumer shift towards debit cards and digital spending.
The cash card will let customers keep separate accounts for investing and spending, Robinhood said. It will replace the company's existing cash management product, where investing and spending cash were all in their brokerage account. 

The Menlo Park, California-based company will also give customers the option to receive paychecks up to two days in advance, via direct deposit, a feature also offered by digital payments giant PayPal Holdings Ltd.
Users could also choose to automatically invest a portion of their paychecks, Robinhood said. The company also said these new features would be free of charge.

Berkshire will pay $848.02/s to acquire Alleghany with the deal expected to close in Q4 2022.
UBS analyst Brian Meredith) has reflected positively on what the Alleghany deal will bring to Berkshire.
We view the transaction as a positive for Berkshire as it is a good use of excess cash, accretive to earnings, around $14bb of insurance ""float"" for the company, and adds a high quality specialty insurer (25% of Y's net premiums written) and reinsurer (75% of net premiums written) to BRK's Re/Insurance business. Further, Berkshire's quota share with Transatlantic (Alleghany's reinsurance company) already gave Berkshire good insight in to the business, and increases BRK's broker market distribution (General Re is largely direct distribution). We continue to like the pricing, growth and margin improvement fundamentals in the E&S and Specialty lines space, Meredith (NYSE:MDP) said in a client note.
The analyst adds that the acquisition is an example of good use of excess capital with BRK reporting $144 billion of cash holdings as of Q4 2021. The analyst doesnt believe that Berkshires share repurchase activity will slow down as a result of this deal.
We also view the purchase price as attractive for BRK. While other reinsurers are trading at around 1.1x book value, specialty commercial insurers trade at more than 2.0x book value, the analyst concluded.

Both Cuscaden Peak and Keppel Corp are linked to state investor Temasek, and the deal had sparked a rare bidding war between the two groups, with the former offering S$2.40 per share, or S$3.9 billion ($2.87 billion), and the latter offering S$2.351 per share or S$3.74 billion for SPH's real estate business.
Keppel Corp, which counts Temasek Holdings as a major shareholder, has previously said it did not agree with SPH's move to terminate its offer. The conglomerate has filed an arbitration notice with the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
Cuscaden Peak, a consortium of property tycoon Ong Beng Seng's Hotel Properties and two independently managed portfolio companies of Temasek, clinched the acquisition, SPH said in a statement. It will gain access to SPH's real estate portfolio, which includes malls, residential properties, student accommodation and nursing homes, but not its loss-making media business, which was separated from the company last year.
A Singapore court is expected to approve the Cuscaden takeover around April 5, and shareholders can expect to start receiving payments from May 11, SPH said.

Canadian carriers are seeing a bounce in spring travel as COVID-19 shows signs of ebbing, but surging oil prices due to the Russia-Ukraine crisis are casting a shadow ahead of the busy summer vacation season. 
Canada's largest carrier said the extra-long-range version of A321neo that will replace the company's older aircraft is expected to be more fuel efficient. The new version will have a range of about 8,700 kilometers (5405.93 miles) and can fly up to 11 hours. 
The Canadian carrier said it would lease 15 aircraft from Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp and five from Dublin-based AerCap Holdings. 
Six aircraft would be acquired from Airbus S.A.S. under an agreement that includes purchase rights to buy an additional 14 planes between 2027 and 2030.
The deliveries would begin in the first quarter of 2024 with the final aircraft to arrive in the first quarter of 2027, Air Canada said. The carrier is in the process of selecting an engine manufacturer for the extra-large version of A321neo.

As of Dec. 31, 2021, Air Canada had a combined 214 aircraft in its mainline and Air Canada Rouge fleets, including 136 single-aisle, narrow-body aircraft.
Last year, Air Canada, which was struggling with a collapse in traffic due to the pandemic, was able to proceed with its planned purchases of 33 Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) 220 airliners after it signed a C$5.9 billion ($4.69 billion) government aid deal.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to supply chain problems for global automakers -- which were already struggling with semiconductor shortages that have cut production -- with a break in deliveries of wire harnesses from the war-torn country. 
While Skoda, the Czech Republic's biggest exporter, said it expects the supply of semiconductors to improve in the second half of 2022, it said the war in Ukraine and supply bottlenecks will put a significant burden on its operating business.
Skoda's 2021 deliveries fell 12.6% year-on-year and earlier this month it stopped production of the ENYAQ because of harness shortages, saying that two other models were at risk because of the lack of availability of the component.
""Our partner...in Ukraine decided to restart production of wire harnesses this week, with full service and full security for workers there,"" Karsten Schnake, Skoda's board member for purchasing, said during its online 2021 earnings presentation.
Wire harnesses form a key part of a car's electrical system, which group and guide cables inside the vehicle.
""We decided to double the production in case something is going wrong, and this production will be ramped up in an alternative factory,"" Schnake said, adding that work there would start in three or four weeks. 
""Hopefully we can restart production of ENYAQ one or two weeks later when we have wire harnesses,"" Schnake said.
Skoda delivered 878,200 cars worldwide in 2021, the first time that this had fallen below the 1 million mark since 2013.
Nevertheless, the VW group brand's sales revenue rose 3.9% to 17.7 billion euros ($19.5 billion) in 2021 and operating profit rose 43.2% to 1.1 billion euros as it took cost measures.
Skoda did not give a financial or production outlook, saying there were still considerable uncertainties as a result of the conflict in Ukraine and the impact on its Russian operations.

Skoda, like VW, has suspended production and other business activities in Russia, which was its second-largest market last year, with 90,400 vehicles delivered.

GIven that shares trade at 24x C23 EPS, Caso says the market is discounting about a 30% cut to consensus earnings. However, the analyst is positive as AMD is likely to ensure further share gains that are likely to continue driving growth given the roadmap disparity with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).
Elsewhere, Caso has most conviction on QCOM, which we think benefits from additional supply in 2H, allowing them to catch up on unfulfilled high-end demand, as well as the catalyst from notebooks in 2023.
Nevertheless, he expects QCOM (QCOM), as well as Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) (SKWS) to see their sales fall q/q in June due to an absence of product launches in the June quarter, before rebounding in September.
Within the analog sector, Caso is positive on  Analog Devices  (NASDAQ:ADI).
We think ADI looks particularly interesting given the upcoming analyst day at which we expect the company to set higher growth targets with expectations for better synergy from the recently closed Maxim acquisition, as well as resilience during a downturn due to their hybrid manufacturing model, which the company believes will result in 70% trough GMs, Caso wrote.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) faces deepening losses and closer regulatory scrutiny following the crash of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 jet on Monday with 132 people on board.
Rescuers on Tuesday scoured heavily forested slopes for survivors and data recorders from flight MU5735, which crashed a day earlier in the mountains of the southern region of Guangxi.
The plane crash, China's first in 12 years, comes as its airline sector is struggling to find its footing amid the coronavirus pandemic, with air passenger traffic far below 2019 levels due to repeated outbreaks and a steep fall in international travel due to China's strict quarantine rules.
China Eastern has been among the biggest casualties: The state carrier forecast in January a 2021 loss of 11-13.5 billion yuan ($1.7-$2.1 billion), after a 11.8 billion yuan loss in 2020.
Its losses are set to deepen after the group, including two subsidiaries, grounded its fleet of 737-800s following Monday's crash. The group has 225 of the aircraft, data from British aviation consultancy IBA shows.
The airline cancelled about 89% of its flights on Tuesday, according to Chinese aviation data provider Flight Master. 
""My guess is that in the short term this is going to cause some issues for China Eastern as their maintenance records are reviewed, and there will likely be a short term pullback from Chinese consumers,"" said Ben Cavender, managing director at China Market Research Group in Shanghai.
Cheng Wang, associate equity analyst at Morningstar, said one of the big risks for China Eastern was if the investigation implies maintenance or other process shortfalls.
""We think most of the impact will be in the near term. The indemnity alone will not have a material impact on our fair value estimates. The potential regulatory actions including fines, additional security requirements, or even grounding of aircraft could make a bigger difference.""
""This crash might also have mid- to long-term implications for China Eastern as the airline could be in an unfavorable position when applying for routes and slots over the next few years if it is found to be at fault.""
China Eastern, which said on Monday it was cooperating with the investigation into the crash, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Its onshore-listed shares slumped more than 6.5% on Tuesday, while those trading in Hong Kong fell nearly 6%.
FEAR OF FLYING
The tragedy has shocked a country which has one of the best airline safety records in the world and whose aviation industry was over the past decade, prior to COVID, one of the world's fastest growing markets by passenger traffic.
Several social media users posted about how it had stoked their fears of flying and some wrote about changing their travel plans, especially after photos of the plane's wreckage and videos apparently showing its descent were shared widely online. 
One Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) user, PLILY-L, said she had planned to travel on a later flight on the same route taken by flight MU5735 from Kunming, capital of the southwestern province of Yunnan, to the port city of Guangzhou before she heard about the incident.
""I was really scared, I immediately cancelled my flight ticket and switched to taking the high-speed rail,"" she wrote. 
Local media reported long queues at the counter of China Eastern at Guangzhou Baiyun airport, saying some travellers were seeking ticket refunds after the incident.
Across the industry, around 78.4% of all flights scheduled for Tuesday were cancelled, according to Flight Master, which attributed that to COVID-19, as China deals with its largest outbreak in two years. 
Some of the fears expressed online about flying were directed towards Boeing, whose brand had already been affected in China by two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft more than three years ago.
Boeing declined to comment and referred Reuters to the statement it released on Monday, when it said it was ready to assist China Eastern and was in contact with U.S. transportation safety regulators about the crash.
Elaine Shen, a Shanghai-based insurance professional who describes herself as a big fan of China Eastern, said she would stick with the airline but would now only fly on planes made by Boeing's rival Airbus.

Rising input costs have also contributed to lower estimates and slashed price targets on General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F).
While we continue to expect auto volumes to improve in 2H22 and further in 2023, we believe there is a wide range of potential outcomes stemming from the war in Ukraine and its impact on the supply chain. We continue to believe that stocks of companies that can navigate the current operating environment and capitalize on key growth opportunities like EVs, autonomy, and datacenter will outperform, Delaney said in a client note.
A new price target on Ford is $20.00 per share, down from the prior $22.00. Similarly, the analyst cut GM PT to $65.00 per share from the prior $72.00.
We reduce our EPS estimates for F and GM in 2022 (Ford by 9% and GM by 2%, with GM's exit from Europe reducing the impact vs. Ford), but we assume that higher costs and a slightly more difficult supply dynamic is mostly offset by better pricing given low vehicle inventory (both companies have done well this cycle to mitigate cost pressures with pricing).
On the other hand, the analyst raised EPS estimates for Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to reflect raised EV prices and a slightly higher volume, with the latter a result of the companys ability to navigate the supply chain, recent government approval for the new Berlin factory, and potentially higher demand for EVs following the rise in oil prices.

A security breach at Okta could result in significant consequences given that the company is used by thousands of businesses, universities, and government agencies that rely on Oktas authentication solutions.
The company has more than 15,000 customers worldwide, including numerous well-known companies such as Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), T-Mobile, the FCC, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO), and others.
Lapsus$ posted the screenshots on its Telegram channel, saying it has had access to Oktas systems for two months, but said the focus was only on Oktas clients.
However, Okta spokesman Chris Hollis said the company is yet to find evidence of the alleged breach.
In late January 2022, Okta detected an attempt to compromise the account of a third-party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors. The matter was investigated and contained by the subprocessor. Hollis said. We believe the screenshots shared online are connected to this January event.
The investigation so far showed no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January, Hollis added.
Lapsus$ is a hacking group that has claimed responsibility for a number of cyberattacks on globally-known companies and organizations including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Samsung (KS:005930), and Ubisoft, among others.

437,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 08:02AM ET</span>",Toshiba's spin-off plan faces much opposition at pivotal shareholder vote,"By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's troubled Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp is going into Thursday's critical shareholder vote on its plan to spin-off its devices business with very long odds.
Its top three shareholders - Effissimo Capital Management, 3D Investment Partners and Farallon Capital Management - all activist shareholders with which Toshiba management has had a contentious history - oppose the plan as do proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis.
Also on the table is a proposal from Singapore-based 3D calling for management to solicit buyout offers from private equity - a motion that has the support of Effissimo, Farallon as well as Glass Lewis but, perhaps significantly, not ISS.
Each proposal needs 50% of the vote to pass.
Whatever the outcome, Thursday's vote represents another major battle in a four-year scandal-filled war being waged between the 146-year-old conglomerate and activist shareholders over the direction of the company. 
Toshiba management argues a spin-off is the best way to maximise shareholder value. Sources familiar with the matter have also said Toshiba hopes the plan would lift its share price to the point where activist shareholders would be enticed to leave.
Toshiba has rejected calls to seek a private equity buyout, arguing that potential offers suggested so far were insufficiently compelling and would raise concerns about the impact on its business and staff retention.
But opposition to Toshiba's plans was widespread as well as vocal, and at present, activist shareholders appear to have a lot of momentum on their side.
Together, Effissimo, 3D and Farallon own around a quarter of Toshiba. All foreign activist funds combined are estimated to hold 30% while more broadly overseas investors own 50% of the industrial conglomerate.
Prominent institutional investors which have already disclosed they have voted against the spin-off include Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which owns 1.22%, the California Public Employees' Retirement System with 0.43% and the State Board of Administration of Florida with a 0.22% stake.
Large investors that have yet to reveal their votes include BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) which owns more than 5%, Elliott Management which, according to sources, has nearly 5% and Vanguard which has 2.6% according to Refinitiv data.
None of Japan's major domestic asset managers have revealed their voting plans.
UNEVEN SUPPORT FOR 3D PROPOSAL
If the spin-off proposal fails, hedge fund investors are likely to emerge emboldened, gaining momentum in their push for a buyout. But even if management wins, some shareholders plan to fight on regardless, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Toshiba said it will continue to make every effort to gain shareholder support for the break-up plan.
""Large shareholders will stay unless share prices go up,"" said Fumio Matsumoto, chief strategist at Okasan Securities.
""A private equity solution would be best for shareholders hoping for a quick exit with solid returns, but may not necessarily be best for Toshiba,"" he added.
Support for 3D's proposal is, however, somewhat less clear-cut than opposition to Toshiba's spin-off plan.
In addition to ISS advising against the proposal, CalPERS has voted against it. 
But Norway's sovereign wealth fund has voted in favour as has Toshiba external director Raymond Zage, a Farallon adviser who says he is a top 100 shareholder and has broken ranks with the public stance of the board.
Toshiba's management has been under pressure from activist funds since it sold 600 billion yen ($5 billion) of stock to dozens of foreign hedge funds during a crisis stemming from the bankruptcy of its U.S. nuclear power unit in 2017. 
Acrimony between the two sides hit several boiling points in the past two years. Last June a shareholder-commissioned probe found Toshiba colluded with Japan's trade ministry - which sees the conglomerate as a strategic asset due to its nuclear reactor and defence technology - to block overseas investors from gaining influence at its 2020 shareholder meeting.

438,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 07:54AM ET</span>",Elon Musk Heads to Opening of Tesla’s First European Factory Outside Berlin,"(Bloomberg) -- Almost 19 years after its founding, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. has a car factory network that spans the globe.
The leading electric-vehicle maker officially opens its assembly plant outside Berlin on Tuesday, Tesla’s first carmaking plant in Europe. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz are both set to attend the official start of production at the 5 billion-euro ($5.5 billion) facility.
The factory -- first announced more than two years ago -- will boost Tesla’s capacity to make Model Y sport utility vehicles as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine drives up fuel costs and adds momentum to already fast-growing EV demand. The question for Musk, 50, is how quickly the company can ramp up output in the midst of industrywide supply chain challenges, including shortages of semiconductors and raw materials for batteries.
“The start of production is nice, but volume production is the hard part,” Musk said during a visit to the plant construction site in October. He said then that Tesla would target making 5,000 to 10,000 vehicles a week by the end of this year.
Tesla’s facility in Gruenheide is essential to Musk’s objectives to boost global production and capture more of Europe’s expanding EV market. He tweeted last week that he was working on a new “master plan” for the carmaker and wrote Monday that “scaling to extreme size” would be among the main subjects.
The factory opening is the culmination of a surprise announcement Musk made in November 2019 while accepting a car award at a glitzy event in Berlin, with the heads of BMW AG, Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) and Audi in the audience. Vehicles will now roll off the production line in Germany’s automotive heartland, where Tesla now employs more than 3,000 workers.
Although Tesla moved quickly to construct the facility, it was beset by months-long permitting delays that at times exasperated the world’s richest person.
Concerns at the site centered around its environmental impact, with activists opposing tree-clearing and the effects the facility would have on wildlife and water supply. The latter issue could linger and factor into Musk’s expansion plans, with the local water authority warning last week that further development won’t be possible without additional extraction permits.

The deliveries mark the launch of the companys first European production hub and the first vehicles handed over from the Gigafactory in nearly nine months.
The Berlin-Brandenburg factory, located in GrÃ¼nheide near Berlin, was originally scheduled to open on July 1, 2021 but permitting issues and protests by local environmentalists postponed its grand opening. Tesla won approval to begin production at the plant earlier this month under the conditions that the factory meets local requirements on air pollution and water usage.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes the opening to be a leap forward for Tesla.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 07:21AM ET</span>",Alibaba upsizes share buyback by two-thirds to record $25 billion,"(Reuters) -Alibaba raised its share buyback programme to $25 billion on Tuesday, the largest ever repurchase plan by the e-commerce giant, to prop up its battered shares as it fights off regulatory scrutiny and concerns about slowing growth.
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) shares, which have more than halved in the past year, surged on the news and closed up 11%. Its U.S. listed stock rose 9% in premarket trading. 
The plan comes amid a tech stock rally in the past few days after Chinese Vice Premier Liu He said that Beijing will roll out more measures to boost the economy as well as favourable policy steps for capital markets.
This is the second time Alibaba Group Holding Ltd has expanded its buyback programme in a year. It had hiked the programme from $10 billion to $15 billion last August. 
""The upsized share buyback underscores our confidence in Alibaba's long-term, sustainable growth potential and value creation,"" Deputy Chief Financial Officer Toby Xu said. 
""Alibaba's stock price does not fairly reflect the company's value given our robust financial health and expansion plans."" 
Alibaba's buyback decision makes sense given how Beijing's measures against monopolistic behaviour and the ""disorderly expansion of capital"" will limit its opportunities for new investments, said Rukim Kuang, founder of Beijing-based Lens Company Research.
""Internet giants will start to re-focus on their main business in the future. As a result, it's not necessary for companies like Alibaba to keep such large amounts of cash on their books,"" he added.
Alibaba said it had $75 billion in cash, cash equivalent and short term investments as of end-December.
The company has been under pressure since late 2020 when its billionaire founder, Jack Ma, publicly criticised China's regulatory system. 
Authorities subsequently halted the planned blockbuster IPO of its financial arm Ant Group and slapped Alibaba with a record $2.8 billion fine for anti-competitive behaviour, triggering a long slide in its shares.
Growing competition from rivals, slowing consumption, and a maturing e-commerce market have also hit its performance.
In its last earnings release, Alibaba posted a 10% year-on-year revenue growth, its slowest quarter since going public in 2014 and the first time growth fell below 20%.
The company is currently preparing to layoff tens of thousands of staffers, Reuters reported in March.
Alibaba said it had re-purchased about $9.2 billion of its U.S.-listed shares as of March 18 under its previously announced programme, which was slated to last until the end of this year.

The current $25 billion programme will be effective for a two-year period through March 2024.

The aircraft was carrying 132 people on board, flying from the city of Kunming to Guangzhou when it crashed mid-flight in the southern region of Guangxi.
No bodies or survivors have been found yet, according to the Chinese state media.
The aircraft was flying at an altitude of 29,100 feet before it started diving sharply, falling over 25,000 feet in just two minutes. The aircraft involved in the accident was flying in China since June 2015.
The crash was unprecedented, said independent aviation analyst Alex Macheras, citing the aircrafts exceptional safety record.
Air travel is the safest form of transport. But when we do suffer incidents or accidents, we dont see anything like what we have seen in China over the last 24 hours, Macheras said.
This nosedive was simply unprecedented, especially from cruising altitude. Were talking about the safest phase of the flight. Thats why those answers are going to be needed as soon as possible to determine, he added.
Heres what top Boeing analysts have to say about yesterdays events.
Morgan Stanleys Kristine Liwag (Overweight, $288): ""The three things that provided investors some comfort regarding Boeings stock are 1) the 737 NG is one of the safest aircraft in service. The 737 NG is one of the workhorses of the global aircraft fleet. There have been ~6,765 deliveries of the aircraft over its lifetime, 2) the crash did not involve the beleaguered MAX (the 737 NG does not have the MCAS software of the MAX), and 3) there are currently no regulatory groundings of the aircraft. Although the stock may be muted in the short-term, we continue to like the setup in the medium to long-term given the information we know today.""
UBS Myles Walton (Buy, $290): ""There is no reason to assume a linkage in cause between prior MAX crashes and the current NG crash but given the opacity of the MAX return to service in China there will be at least a perception of incremental delay for the MAX return to commercial schedules. As of this morning, China Eastern has chosen to ground the remainder of its 100+ 737-800 aircraft pending the crash investigation (~20% of China Eastern's fleet of all aircraft and about 2% of the world's ~6,800 737NG aircraft) but we would not expect others to follow.""
Cowens Cai von Rumohr (Outperform, $230): ""Under normal circumstances, authorities would not ground all 737's after a crash unless there were reason to suspect a common problem. Given BA's problems with the 737 MAX, there is some chance that consumers may not want to fly on a 737 until the cause of the China Eastern crash is determined not to be a design or manufacturing issue.""
Boeing stock price closed 3.59% in the red yesterday.

The bank is now expecting the Fed to move in a more aggressive manner following Chair Powells speech yesterday.
There is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if that is what is required to restore price stability, Powell said yesterday. 
""We'll be looking at the data as they come in. We'll be looking to see whether the data show expected improvement on inflation...if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we'll do so, he added.
For Hatzius, the fact that Powell moved from steadily in January to expeditiously today shows that the Fed is preparing to deliver a 50bp rate hike in May. The market-implied pricing suggests around a 70% chance of a 50bp rate hike in May.
We now forecast 50bp hikes at both the May and June meetings, followed by 25bp hikes at the four remaining meetings in the back half of 2022 and three quarterly hikes in 2023Q1-Q3. We have left our forecast of the terminal rate unchanged at 3-3.25%. We continue to expect the FOMC to announce the start of balance sheet reduction at the May meeting, but after todays comments we do not think this is necessarily an obstacle to also delivering a 50bp hike in May, Hatzius explained.
The economist sees the conflict in Ukraine as a downside risk to his new forecast, although neither looks like an obstacle at this point.
UBS economist Jonathan Pingle is still calling for a 25bp rate increase at the May meeting.
We feel pretty comfortable after hearing the totality of Bostic and Powell today, and with so little news since the SEP last week, that the median participant's base case is still a 25 bp rate increase at the May meeting, and a decision to initiate QT. However, this depends on the data, including the employment report and upcoming CPI. Plus, market pricing is data too. If Treasury bond markets price in the vast majority of a 50 bp rate increase with little negative spillover to other markets, we believe that would factor importantly into the Committee's decision over whether to raise rates by 25 or 50 at the May meeting, Pingle commented in his report.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Aluminum Corp of China Ltd, known as Chalco, said on Tuesday its net income surged 564.6% in 2021 to log its best performance in 14 years, thanks to rising alumina and aluminium prices and higher production.
Average global alumina prices rose 22% last year, Chalco said, while Shanghai aluminium futures jumped more than 30% and LME three-month aluminium was up 42%.
That helped the Chinese aluminium giant earn net profit of 5.08 billion yuan ($798.65 million) last year, it said in a filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the highest since 2007, while revenue rose 45% year-on-year to 269.7 billion yuan. 
The world's top producer of aluminium raw material alumina said its output of the feedstock rose 11.7% year-on-year in 2021 to 16.23 million tonnes. 
Its aluminium production rose 4.6% to 3.86 million tonnes, gaining for the first time in three years. 
That sent aluminium output at parent company Chinalco - which also controls Yunnan Aluminium - to around 6.16 million tonnes from 6.1 million tonnes in 2020. 
China's nonferrous industry had weathered headwinds from the country's efforts to cut carbon emissions, with aluminium makers suffering a power crunch and forced to cut production. 
Yunnan Aluminium said on Monday that the power restrictions had led the company to fail to meet its annual aluminium production targets, with output declining 4.4% to 2.3 million tonnes.
Chalco logged a net loss of 227.9 million yuan in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with net income of 2.2 billion yuan in the third quarter. 
The company said it had managed to ensure supply and adjust production to minimize impact from the power curbs and from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
A jump in alumina prices since the second half of 2021, as well as higher aluminium prices due to global tight supply, had shored up the company's performance, it said. 

In a separate filing on the Shanghai bourse, Chalco said it aims to issue debt financing tools worth up to 50 billion yuan in 2022, and to invest two billion yuan to set up an electrode material unit.

Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will attend the opening of one of the largest German car plants in recent history. The launch comes as Musk releases the third part of Teslas Master Plan, which will see the carmaker scale to extreme size. 
Tesla plans to hire 12,000 employees at its new plant, which will make it the largest employer in the German state of Brandenburg. The Berlin Gigafactory will have a capacity to produce 500,000 EVs annually at full capacity as well as produce 50-gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery power, more than any other electric car plant in Germany. 
Reaching full capacity at the new plant will take more than two years, said Elon Musk. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) estimates that the Berlin Gigafactory could produce roughly 54,000 vehicles in 2022, which will then increase to 280,000 in 2023 and 500,000 by 2025.
German automaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) (VWAGY (OTC:VWAGY)) continues to dominate the EV market in Europe, holding a 25% market share, compared to Teslas 13%. 
Volkswagen plans to open a new 2 billion euro EV factory alongside its Wolfsburg plant and six battery plants across Europe. The EV plant is scheduled to begin production in 2026, and the first battery plant next year. 
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives sees the Berlin Gigafactory launch as a major strategic step forward.
We view the opening of Giga Berlin as one of the biggest strategic endeavors for Tesla over the last decade and should further vault its market share within Europe over the coming years as more consumers aggressively head down the EV path. With German authorities finally giving approval to officially begin production in Giga Berlin, this removes a major overhang on the stock over the past few months, Ives said in a client note.
The analyst cannot stress the production importance of Giga Berlin to the overall success of Tesla's footprint in Europe and globally. 
Ives adds that the Berlin Gigafactory will provide Tesla with a major competitive advantage to further build out its supply footprint in this key region.

449,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 06:22AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Mexico flared record levels of gas in 2021 -study,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Flaring by the energy sector in Mexico hit record levels last year while the number of sites where gas is burnt off also rose despite government pledges to reduce such activity, research by a leading team of scientists showed.
The practice releases carbon dioxide, black carbon and other pollutants as well as methane, a potent greenhouse gas scientists have linked to global warming. It also wastes usable resources associated with many oil deposits.
Mexico flared 6.5 billion cubic meter (bcm) of gas in 2021, up from 5.8 bcm a year earlier, said Tamara Sparks, a researcher at the Earth Observation Group of the Colorado School of Mines, who analyzed NASA satellite images of flare sites for Reuters.
""Flaring peaked in early 2021 but remained high enough throughout the year to beat 2020, which was already a record high,"" Sparks said.
The data from the Earth Observation Group also showed a rise in the number of individual flare sites across Mexico last year to 181 from 170 in 2020, Sparks said. Records in their current form began in 2012.
The numbers have not previously been reported.
Increased flaring emits millions of additional tons of greenhouse gases, the researchers at the Earth Observation Group estimated. 
But flaring is cheaper in the short term than investing in expensive infrastructure to capture, process and transport it for other uses.
Officials at the state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) and the Energy Ministry have said current budget priorities are focused on exploration and raising oil production, as well as two new refineries. 
Neither Pemex nor the energy ministry responded to a request for comment for this story.
Pemex, the world's most indebted state oil company, has been under pressure to meet ambitious oil production targets under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, an energy nationalist, with little or no private investment 
When Lopez Obrador took office in late 2018, Mexico had flared 3.9 bcm that year, the data showed. Since then, the practice has soared even as oil production in Mexico has fallen.
The 2021 data suggests that in spite of pledges to reduce flaring, and greenhouse gas emissions, Mexico remains behind in a global push to transition to cleaner energy. 
Researchers and scientists around the world, including at the World Bank, which leads a global push to end routine flaring by 2030, have warned the practice contributes to climate change and environmental pollution.
Pemex stated in recent quarterly filings that it is flaring too much. Infrastructure to deal with gas associated with oil production is inefficient, outdated or nonexistent, it has said.
Lopez Obrador has argued it will take time to turn Pemex around and accused his predecessors of decades of mismanagement and plundering.

Emily Medina, a fellow at the Energy Policy Research Foundation, said Pemex has a social and environmental obligation to reduce flaring, and that it would also make economic sense.
""Gas is a valuable commodity particularly under the current high price environment,"" Medina said. ""It could help strengthen Mexico's energy security.""

""So, we can so far dismiss the possibility of stagflation because even in the weakest scenario we are looking at growth of around 2% in 2022,"" he told a conference, referring to a phenomenon of high inflation coupled with stagnating growth.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian food-delivery giant Zomato Ltd is facing a backlash on social media for its plans to roll out a 10-minute food service that critics say raises road-safety risks for delivery riders.
CEO Deepinder Goyal said in a post late on Monday the service ""Zomato Instant"" would rely on a densely located network of so-called food ""finishing stations"", which will house bestseller items from restaurants and use a sophisticated demand prediction algorithm.
""Nobody in the world has so far delivered hot and fresh food in under 10 minutes at scale,"" Goyal wrote on LinkedIn and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). ""We were eager to be the first.""
Within hours, Zomato's announcement sparked a flurry of responses. A lawmaker questioned the business model while executives raised concerns about rider safety on Indian roads.
Zomato, which counts China's Ant Group as an investor, did not respond to requests for comment.
Many on social media urged a rethink, saying food can wait as even ambulances in India take longer to reach patients. Some on LinkedIn questioned the need for such a model.
""I don't want to eat food that someone has brought to me while keeping his life at risk,"" wrote Gunjan Rastogi, a researcher at India's RSB Insights & Analytics. 
Karti P. Chidambaram, an Indian lawmaker, tweeted: ""This is absurd! It's going to put undue pressure on the delivery personnel.""
The Zomato CEO's Monday announcement started by saying: ""We will start with a clarification ... we do not put any pressure on delivery partners.""
After it failed to convince many, Goyal issued another tweet on Tuesday stressing that delivery will be ""safe"" for riders who will face no penalties, urging people to understand the model ""before the outrage"".
""Quick commerce"" grocery startups in India have been a rage with SoftBank-backed Blinkit and rival Zepto expanding rapidly. Reuters reported in January delivery bikers said they faced pressure to meet deadlines, which often led to speeding, for fear of being rebuked by store managers.
Critics say risks are too high on Indian roads. Even in cities, most roads are riddled with potholes and motorists violate basic rules. The World Bank says India has a death every four minutes on its roads and crashes kill around 150,000 people each year.

Nevertheless, many customers have been hooked to quick commerce grocery services to meet their instant shopping needs.
""I would be happy to get my food in 10 minutes,"" said one LinkedIn user, Sonu Sekharan.

(Reuters) - European shares were subdued at the close on Monday after choppy trading, as the surge in energy stocks was offset by investor concerns around fighting in Ukraine.
The pan-European STOXX 600 was flat after posting its biggest weekly percentage gain since November 2020 on Friday.
Investors were closely tracking the war in Ukraine, with European Union governments mulling an oil embargo on Russia as they gather this week with U.S. President Joe Biden for a series of summits aimed at hardening their stance against Moscow. 
The news sparked a rally in oil prices. Brent crude futures rose more than $3 to trade above $111 a barrel, lifting the European oil & gas sector by 3.0%. [O/R]
""European crude embargo is expected to be put on the table once more, with the possibility that more than a million barrels of Russian oil a day will be snubbed,"" said Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV).
""Given that the Netherlands and Germany combined received around a quarter of Russia's crude and light oil exports, demand would shoot up for crude supplies from OPEC+ nations."" 
Oil exporters-heavy London's FTSE 100 led gains among its continental peers, rising 0.5%, as BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) gained 4.1% each. 
Meanwhile, France's blue-chip index and Germany's DAX fell 0.6% each. 
Adding to investor concerns, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday that the central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to bring too-high inflation to heel, adding that it could use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes if needed to do so.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned earlier in the day to expect the Fed and ECB to move out of sync in the foreseeable future, as the war in Ukraine has vastly different effects on their economies.
""For the ECB to say you could expect some policy divergence seems a bit strange at this moment unless there's going to be some future policy announcement from the ECB that they're going to take more notice of the growth deteriorating prospects caused by the fighting in Ukraine,"" said Stuart Cole, head macro economist at Equiti Capital.

""By continuing to operate the passenger car tyre factory in Russia we want to make sure that the factory is operated and controlled by Nokian Tyres also in the future,"" it said.

Shares in Nokian fell as much as 13% on Monday, after Helsingin Sanomat daily and other Finnish media reported that the company had seemed to tell analysts in a call last week that it would seek to win market share from rivals that are exiting Russia, such as  Michelin  (PA:MICP), Continental and Bridgestone, or those curtailing activities there, such as Pirelli.
Nokian denied this on Tuesday. ""On Sunday Nokian Tyres was in the spotlight in the media regarding an analyst call,"" it said, saying it was now making a ""correction to the media"".
Nokian Chief Executive Jukka Moisio told Helsingin Sanomat in an interview published on Monday that the company did not want its Russian factory to end up ""in wrong hands"" to avoid its Russian factories being used to make tyres for the military.
""In our opinion it is better that the factory is in our control than in someone else's,"" Moisio told the paper.
Russia's ruling party said this month a government commission had approved the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country.

Nokian said it would seek to boost capacity more swiftly at its factories in Finland and in the United States and would look for additional capacity elsewhere.
It said all tyres sold in the Nordic countries in future would be made in Finland and tyres sold in North America would be made in the United States or Finland. It added that it aimed to make its manufacturing more geographically diversified.

456,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2022 04:20AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Inflation or growth?,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao
A JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) survey shows a record high 86% of its clients planned to raise equity exposure. It is unclear if those plans will have come unstuck after the latest spurt in oil and commodity, and galloping inflation expectations. 
The bank itself is warning central banks face a stark choice --to ""live with energy-driven inflation or kill off economic growth"".
The rise in five-year Treasury ""breakevens"" to 3.5% is alarming, coming as it does on the heels of the Federal Reserve's interest rate liftoff and money markets pricing nearly 200 basis points of increases this year alone.
So breakevens, essentially bond markets' view of where inflation may be in five years time, have responded to policy tightening signals by moving even higher. While five-year inflation swaps, possibly a more reliable gauge, are at 2.3%, that's still above the Fed's target.
Fed boss Jerome Powell came out swinging on Monday, with a pledge of 50 bps moves if needed. Money markets also now see a roughly 3% Fed funds rate by Sept. 2023, compared to a 2.1% pricing at the start of March.
In short, chances are the Fed -- and other central banks -- will act aggressively to stamp out inflation which they now see as racing away from them. 
Emerging market central banks know that feeling of losing control of inflation -- Hungary should on Tuesday raise rates by 100 bps, while Brazil has raised rates by almost 10 percentage points this cycle and is still signalling more. 
So Wall Street futures are flat after Monday's slide while Europe is lower. Brent crude is almost at $120 a barrel. And listen out for raft of Fed and ECB speakers later in the day.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
-Alibaba raises buyback programme to $25 billion
-BOJ's Kuroda renews powerful easing pledge
-ECB speakers: board member Fabio Panetta, Vice President Luis de Guindos, Chief Economist Philip Lane
-Fed speakers: New York President John Williams, Cleveland President Loretta Mester, San Francisco Fed's Mary Daly

But that’s done little to boost its stock’s fortunes. 
The e-commerce giant’s shares are trading about 60% below last year’s peak even after the company deployed more than $9 billion to repurchase its stock, according to Bloomberg’s calculation. The Hangzhou-based firm unveiled a plan on Tuesday to boost its buyback plan to $25 billion -- the third increase since Beijing’s tech crackdown started in late 2020.
The stock’s lackluster performance reflects lingering worries about the impact of China’s crackdown, which has left virtually no corner of Alibaba’s core business untouched. It also mirrors the broader weakness in Chinese equities, where a fresh virus outbreak and slowing economic growth have hurt sentiment.
To be sure, Alibaba’s shares jumped as much as 9.8% to HK$108.80 in Hong Kong on Tuesday after the buyback was announced. But, that’s still a distance from the peak of HK$267 reached in February last year. The stock’s losses of $450 billion are the world’s biggest after those of its peer Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally lower Tuesday, with investors monitoring the Ukraine war as well as U.S. monetary policy developments.
At 3 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.4% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.1%.
Russian troops have continued their bombardment of several cities in Ukraine, with the southern port of Mariupol having become a focal point while attacks were also reported to have intensified on the second city of Kharkiv.
Diplomacy efforts have so far failed to bear fruit, while U.S. President Joe Biden issued a strong warning that Russia is considering using chemical weapons, adding that President Vladimir Putin's ""back was against the wall.""
Biden is set to arrive in Brussels on Thursday for summits with members of NATO as well as the European Union governments, to discuss their response to Russia’s aggression.
Elsewhere, investors will also digest Monday’s hawkish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in the wake of last week’s interest rate hike of 25 basis points, the likely start of a sustained tightening cycle.
Powell said the central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to raise rates and possibly ""more aggressively"" to keep inflation from getting entrenched. Influential investment bank Goldman Sachs now expects the Fed to raise interest rates by 50 basis points at both its May and June meetings.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said on Monday that the world's two top central banks will move out of sync in the foreseeable future, as the war in Ukraine will have very different effects on their economies.
There is little in the way of major economic data releases due Tuesday, while in corporate news Finland's  Nokian Renkaat  (HE:TYRES) said it has decided to continue production in Russia to ensure it retains control of its local factory.
Oil prices extended recent gains as the foreign ministers of European Union governments discussed joining the United States in sanctioning Russian oil in return for Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Attacks on Saudi Arabian oil facilities by Iranian-aligned Houthis over the weekend have also added jitters to the market.

(Reuters) - Disney CEO Bob Chapek on Monday told employees the company made a mistake remaining silent on Florida legislation that would limit classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity, pledging to use the moment as a catalyst for change.
The comments at a virtual town hall for employees came amid a period of internal strife at Disney, as the company shifted its public statements about the legislation, which critics call the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.
A group of employees staged a week of walk-outs to call on Disney to protect its LGBTQ+ staff, their families and communities. A day-long walkout is planned for Tuesday.
""We know the moment requires urgency - and words are not enough,"" said Chapek, according to a recording of his remarks obtained by Reuters. ""So we are taking some actions right now.""
Paul Richardson, Disney's chief human resources officer, said the company canceled a leadership meeting in Orlando, and a planned diversity event scheduled for April 13, so executives could spend their time listening employees, according to three executives who listened to his presentation at the town hall.
Chapek and his senior leaders will conduct a global listening tour and meet with employees in the United States and internationally, Disney said separately.
Disney also said it has established an LGBTQ+ task force to be led by Paul Roeder, senior vice president of communications for the Studios, and Lisa Becket, senior vice president of global marketing for Disney Parks, Experiences and Products.
The company said the task force will enlist the help of experts to develop a concrete plan to ensure Disney is ""a force for good"" for LGBTQ+ communities, especially children and family.
The company reiterated its commitment to pause political contributions in Florida, and said it would support the Human Rights Campaign's fight against a Texas Governor Greg Abbott's executive order mandating that the state's child welfare agency treat gender-affirming medical treatments as ""child abuse.""
Benjamin Siemon, a Disney TV animation writer who is gay, welcomed the apology from executives on their handling of the legislation.
""That means a lot. That was the right thing to do,"" Siemon said in a video posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). 
But he added that employees were worried that Disney would resume their political donations to politicians who supported the legislation, and asked the company to make the pause permanent.
Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has accused Disney of being ""woke"" because the company publicly opposed the legislation after the employee backlash.

""You're going to be called woke no matter what you do, Disney,"" animation writer Siemon said.
""You put Minnie Mouse in a pantsuit for one month in Paris and now you are being called woke. Be woke by owning it, doing the right thing for your employees.""

Sunac China Holdings Ltd. and Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. also announced delays as both blamed the latest Covid-19 wave in China. Sunac’s dollar bonds fell, with the two firms among leading decliners on a Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of developer shares. Hong Kong-listed property firms face a March 31 deadline to file annual results.
Evergrande’s shares remain suspended. The debt-saddled developer and its financial advisers will hold an investor call Tuesday. The builder told creditors in January it aimed to issue a preliminary restructuring plan in the subsequent six months.
 
Key Developments:
 
China Evergrande Said to Hold Investor Call Amid Trading Halt (10:26 a.m. HK)
China Evergrande Group and its financial advisers will hold an investor call Tuesday after it announced a likely delay in audited 2021 results and had trading halted in its shares and onshore bonds.
The call is to start at 9 p.m. Hong Kong time, according to two investors who received the invitation and asked not to be named in discussing the private information. The firm didn’t immediately have a comment when reached by Bloomberg. 
Sunac Bonds, Shares Slide as Audited Results to Be Delayed (10:03 a.m. HK)
Sunac dollar and onshore bonds fell sharply Tuesday morning after it said it likely won’t release audited 2021 results this month, while a yuan note halted trading.
The firm’s 6.8% yuan bond due 2023 halted trading after it fell 21.9%.
Evergrande Joins China Developers Set to Miss Earnings Deadline (9:18 a.m. HK)
Evergrande and its two Hong Kong-listed units expect to delay publishing the results by March 31 because audit work hasn’t been completed, a stock exchange filing showed Tuesday. Sunac and Shimao issued similar statements Monday night.
Evergrande said “drastic changes” in the operating environment added to audit procedures. Shimao and Sunac plan to release unaudited 2021 results on March 31. Evergrande said it will publish audited results “as soon as practicable” after audit procedures are completed. 
Chinese property firms listed in Hong Kong face a March 31 deadline to file annual results, their first audited financial statements since the industry’s liquidity crisis spread. Transparency and governance concerns have cropped up alongside worries about developers’ ability to repay debt following a record number of defaults last year. 
Evergrande Services to Probe 13.4b Yuan Pledge Guarantees (8:45 a.m. HK)
Evergrande Property Services Group has found that deposits of about 13.4 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) as security for third-party pledge guarantees had been enforced by the relevant banks, it said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. 
The company will establish an independent investigation committee and arrange for experts to be appointed to investigate the pledge guarantees, it said.

Sunac and its subsidiaries said they see a decrease in profit attributable to owners of the company of approximately 85% year-on-year and a core net profit decline of about 50% compared with a year earlier. It cited “challenging conditions in the real estate industry during the second half of last year” as among the reasons for the drop.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Tuesday morning, with U.S. and European equity futures falling. Bonds were under pressure as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell adopted a more hawkish tone on monetary policy.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 1.63% by 10:17 PM ET (2:17 AM GMT), with the market reopening after a holiday.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.66% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.18%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 0.64%.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.15% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.81%.
U.S. Treasuries extended losses on Monday, which included one of the biggest daily climbs in short-dated yields in the past decade. The gap between five-year and 30-year U.S. yields is near its smallest since 2007. Australian and New Zealand debt were also on a downward trend.
A weaker Japanese yen could bolster exporters’ outlooks in Australia, South Korea, and Japan, where stocks were up.
Powell said the Fed is prepared to hike interest rates by a half percentage point at its next policy meeting if needed. The central bank hiked its interest rate to 0.5% as it handed down its latest policy decision during the previous week.
Movements in the bond market remained a focal point for some investors, who worried about an economic downturn.
“If Powell is reinforcing that they are going to address inflation, that they’ve made mistakes, that their expectations of inflation were incorrect, just admitting that and saying that we’re ready to do everything it takes, is definitely reassuring for equity investors,” Main Street Asset Management chief investment officer Erin Gibbs told Bloomberg.
Derivative traders on Monday priced in about seven and a half rate hikes at the remaining six Fed meetings for 2022.
“For the long term, 2.3% on the 10-year is not such a high figure at all. What spooks the market is when you have very quick moves, such as what we’re having now,” Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) Inc. senior equity strategist Linda Duessel told Bloomberg.
While Fed tightening might cause disruptions throughout the yield curve, the gap between the three-month and 10-year tenors is still steeply upward sloping, supporting the view that the U.S. economy remains strong, she added.
In contrast to the Fed, expectations are growing that the People’s Bank of China will loosen monetary policy to support the economy as the country continues to deal with its latest COVID-19 outbreak.
China’s State Council pledged stronger monetary policy support but cautioned against flooding the market with liquidity on Monday, according to local media. The government also vowed to avoid measures that can hurt market sentiment.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will speak at the BIS innovation summit later in the day, with Powell and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey following a day later.
Meanwhile, U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will release his “spring statement” on the budget on Wednesday. U.S. President Joe Biden will attend a NATO emergency summit in Brussels a day later."

GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) -A China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 with 132 people on board crashed in mountains in southern China on Monday after a sudden plunge from cruising altitude at about the time when it would normally start to descend ahead of its landing. 
Media said there were no signs of survivors on the domestic flight.
The airline said it deeply mourned the passengers and crew, without specifying how many people had been killed on the jet, an earlier model to the 737 MAX with a strong safety record.
Boeing said it was ready to assist China Eastern and was in contact with U.S. transportation safety regulators over the incident.
Chinese media carried brief highway video footage from a vehicle's dashcam apparently showing a jet diving to the ground behind trees at an angle of about 35 degrees off vertical. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, to Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong, when it crashed. 
China Eastern said the cause of the crash was under investigation. Such accidents typically involve multiple factors and experts warned it was far too early to draw any conclusions on the potential causes, especially in light of the scarce information available.
Investigators will be scouring the wreckage and flight recorders for factors that could have caused the plane to plummet vertically and slam into the mountains at high speed.
The airline said it had sent a working group to the site. There were no foreigners on the flight, Chinese state television reported, citing China Eastern.
Relatives, friends and colleagues of passengers gathered late on Monday in a cordoned off area at the jet's destination, Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport. 
One man surnamed Yan said that a colleague had been on the plane, and that he had notified the 29-year-old's mother.
""When she picked up the phone, she choked up,"" said Yan, adding that he had a ""heavy heart"" when he heard the news.
China Eastern staff were making arrangements for relatives who wished to travel to the crash site on Tuesday, Yan said. Reuters was not able to independently verify Yan's identity.
The aircraft, with 123 passengers and nine crew on board, lost contact over the city of Wuzhou, China's Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) and the airline said.
The flight left Kunming at 1:11 p.m. (0511 GMT), FlightRadar24 data showed, and had been due to land in Guangzhou at 3:05 p.m. (0705 GMT).
The plane, which the flight tracking service said was six years old, had been cruising at 29,100 feet at 0620 GMT. The same flight number a day earlier began a normal gradual descent from the same altitude, also at 0620 GMT, and landed safely in Guangzhou, according to Flightradar24.
The flight that crashed instead began a rapid descent to 7,425 feet before recovering briefly to 8,600 feet and then descended rapidly again, FlightRadar24 data showed. The last tracked altitude was 3,225 feet above sea level.
Media cited a rescue official as saying the plane had disintegrated and caused a fire destroying bamboo trees. The People's Daily quoted a provincial firefighting department official as saying there was no sign of life among the debris.
State media showed a piece of the plane on a scarred, earthen hillside. There was no sign of a fire or personal belongings.
DESCENT STAGE
Crashes during the cruise phase of flights are relatively rare, even though this period accounts for the majority of flight time. Crashes during the descent stage when the plane first leaves cruising altitude are even more uncommon.
Boeing said last year 13% of fatal commercial accidents globally between 2011 and 2020 occurred during the cruise phase, whereas 3% occurred on descent, none on initial approach, 28% on final approach and 26% on landing.
Online weather data showed partly cloudy conditions with good visibility in Wuzhou at the time of the crash.
President Xi Jinping called for investigators to determine the cause of the crash as soon as possible, state broadcaster CCTV reported. 
Boeing said in a statement that its thoughts were with the passengers and crew. 
""Boeing is in contact with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and our technical experts are prepared to assist with the investigation led by (CAAC),"" the company said.
The disaster comes as Boeing seeks to rebound from several overlapping crises including the coronavirus pandemic and crashes involving its 737 MAX model. Shares of the planemaker closed 3.6% lower.
China Eastern has grounded its fleet of 737-800 planes, state media reported. It has 109 of the aircraft, according to FlightRadar24.
Shares of China Eastern Airlines in Hong Kong closed down 6.5% after news of the crash emerged, while its U.S.-listed shares closed 6.3% lower. 
'GOOD RECORD'
Aviation data provider OAG said this month that state-owned China Eastern Airlines was the world's sixth-largest carrier by scheduled weekly seat capacity.
The 737-800 has a good safety record and is the predecessor to the 737 MAX model that has been grounded in China for more than three years after fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
The crash has again thrust the U.S. manufacturer's most sold aircraft family into the spotlight and comes as it works to emerge from the 737 MAX safety crisis and global pandemic, which decimated air travel demand and strained its finances.
​ Investigators will search for the plane's black boxes - the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder - to shed light on the crash.
The U.S. NTSB said it had appointed a senior air safety investigator as an accredited U.S. representative to China's probe.

Air crash investigations are typically led by the country of the accident and include participation by the plane's country of origin, so U.S. investigators would be expected to join the probe of the U.S.-made Boeing jet.
China's airline safety record has been among the best in the world for a decade, although it is less transparent than in countries like the U.S. and Australia where regulators release detailed reports on non-fatal incidents, according to Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication Flightglobal.

(Reuters) -Canada on Monday called for a quick negotiated end to a work stoppage at the country's second-largest railroad,  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP) Railway Ltd, that is set to aggravate a shortage of commodities sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Fearful of an enduring strike, which began on Sunday, industry groups are calling on the Canadian government to propose back-to-work legislation to swiftly end the dispute.
Canada, the largest country by area after Russia, depends heavily on rail to move commodities like grain and manufactured goods to port, in addition to 75% of all fertilizer in the country, according to an industry group. 
The agricultural sector is already facing shortages and higher prices due to Western economic sanctions on Russia and Belarus, two major fertilizer producers.
""The world needs Canada's grain now more than ever,"" said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of the Western Grain Elevator Association, which represents companies. 
He said railways have struggled to meet half of the grain industry's weekly demands despite this year's crop being 35% smaller than average, and warned the CP strike could take the situation from ""terrible to catastrophic.""
Federal mediators are involved in the negotiations between CP and the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference which represents the unionized locomotive engineers, among others. 
""We have faith in their ability to reach an agreement. Canadians expect them to do that ASAP,"" Canada's Labor minister, Seamus O'Regan, said.
The work stoppage in Canada could be felt south of the border as CP's rail network runs as far south as Kansas City, Missouri, in the United States.
Mike Steenhoek, the Iowa-based executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition, said his concern is that the railroad cannot make fertilizer shipments from Canada into the United States.
""The current war in Ukraine is placing additional pressure on delivering U.S. agricultural production and inputs, particularly fertilizer,"" Steenhoek wrote in an emailed newsletter. 
""A shut down in operations at Canadian Pacific will certainly compound that stress."" 
Corey Rosenbusch, the Fertilizer Institute president and CEO, said the United States imports 86% of its potash from Canada, much of it by rail.
Fertilizer Canada's president and CEO, Karen Proud, said timing is key since ""we are 4-6 weeks away from seeding in Canada and even sooner in the U.S."" 
 Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd, the world's biggest fertilizer producer, could weather a CP shutdown lasting a few days, since it has moved potash from its Canadian mines to U.S. stores ahead of spring planting, interim Chief Executive Ken Seitz told Reuters. But a longer shutdown would force Nutrien to consider slowing potash production, Seitz said.
The CP strike is the latest blow to Canada's battered supply chain, which last year weathered floods in British Columbia that suspended access to the country's biggest port.
An eight-day strike at Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co in 2019 cost the fertilizer industry between C$200 million and C$300 million ($159 million-$238 million), the industry group estimates.

The Mining Association of Canada said the work stoppages such as CP's bring extra operational costs to businesses and ""reduce confidence in Canada"" as a destination for investment for supply-chain reliant businesses.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) -Indian lenders are set to initiate debt recovery proceedings against Future Retail this week to safeguard their interests after rival Reliance unexpectedly took over some of the retailer's stores, two bankers told Reuters.
Future, hit by the pandemic, has been struggling to pay off its debt and is fighting a bitter legal battle with U.S retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). That battle has successfully blocked a $3.4 billion sale of its retail assets to India's largest retailer Reliance, citing violation of certain contracts. 
Future denies any wrongdoing. But Reliance Industries suddenly took control of hundreds of Future stores late last month, citing non-payment of rent, after assuming many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future.
State-owned lender Bank of Baroda will be the first to take Future to the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and is expected to file the paperwork this week, the two bankers said.
""We are taking this step as a measure of last resort because we want to protect ourselves in this legal fiasco,"" said one of the bankers directly involved in the matter. ""Going to DRT will ensure that Reliance can't pull another sudden move."" 
Other lenders are likely to follow suit, the second banker with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Future Retail and BoB did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Future Group as a whole has more than $4 billion in debt and lenders have already started classifying the loans as non-performing assets (NPA) this quarter.
Lenders are also likely to subsequently file a case in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that handles corporate insolvency cases, both bankers told Reuters. Future and Amazon are fighting it out at multiple levels, including at India's Supreme Court.
Given the legal complexities in this case, approaching the DRT first is likely to help banks attach, seize and sell Future's assets promptly, instead of going after the entire company at NCLT, Ketan Mukhija, a partner at Link Legal said.

""It is a very strategic, tactical call (by the banks),"" he said.

Terms of the deal with California-based SpaceX, a direct competitor of OneWeb in the burgeoning broadband satellite industry, were not disclosed.
Earlier this month, OneWeb called off the scheduled March 4 launch of 36 satellites from Baikonur and suspended ties with Russia's space agency Roscosmos because of last-minute demands imposed on the company by Moscow, including a guarantee that OneWeb's technology would not be used for military purposes.
The OneWeb launch scrub came amid heightened tensions between Russia and NATO governments, including Britain, over economic sanctions imposed against Moscow by the West in response to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
The British government, which holds a stake in OneWeb, also said it was reviewing its participation in further projects with Russia in light of the Ukraine crisis.
The British satellite firm expects its first launch with SpaceX later this year to add to its constellation of 428 satellites already in low-Earth orbit.
""With these launch plans in place, we’re on track to finish building out our full fleet of satellites,"" OneWeb Chief Executive Officer Neil Masterson said.

OneWeb, which plans to offer universal broadband through a network that will ultimately consist of 650 satellites, was rescued from bankruptcy by the British government and Indian telecoms giant Bharti Global in 2020. Eutelsat Communications (OTC:EUTLF) and SoftBank Group Corp are among other investors in the firm.
SpaceX's Starlink, one of several ventures in the fast-growing satellite broadband business, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) subsidiary Project Kuiper, has put some 1,500 satellites in operation, providing internet access to regions underserved or hard to reach for other services.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street closed lower on Monday, with stocks extending their slide after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted at a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy than previously anticipated, adding to uncertainties regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
While all three major U.S. stock indexes ended well off session lows, they snapped four-session winning streaks on the heels of their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2020.
The central bank must move ""expeditiously"" to combat inflation, Powell told the National Association for Business Economics conference, adding that bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes could be deployed if needed.
""Much of the news today was telegraphed last week in (Powell's) comments,"" said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. ""The difference is there was some question regarding whether a 50 basis-point rate hike might be a course of action sooner rather than later."" 
Fed funds futures now imply a 60.7% chance of a 50 basis-point hike in key interest rates at the Fed's next meeting in May, up from 52% before the text of Powell's speech was released. 
""Some Fed governors have been vocal about front-end loading some of those hikes, putting them on the books sooner rather than later,"" Keator added. ""But I don't think the markets should anticipate a series of 50 basis-point rate hikes between now and the end of the year.""
Fighting raged on in Ukraine as efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict appeared to be making little progress.
Crude prices continued to surge as the European Union weighed joining the United States in banning Russian oil [O/R], which raised supply concerns and helped put energy shares out front.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 201.94 points, or 0.58%, to 34,552.99, the S&P 500 lost 1.94 points, or 0.04%, to 4,461.18 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 55.38 points, or 0.4%, to 13,838.46.
Six the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 ended the session in the red, with communication services suffering the biggest percentage loss. Energy was the clear winner, gaining 3.8% on the day.
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co slid 3.6% after one of its 737-800 aircraft operated by China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) crashed in southern China with no apparent survivors.
The rising geopolitical temperature helped defense stocks. Despite Boeing's decline, the S&P 500 Aerospace and Defense index rose 1.5%, with  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN),  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) advancing between 2.5% and 4.6%.

Shares of  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) rose more than 4% in after-hours trading after the company beat quarterly revenue estimates.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.50-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.70-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

(Reuters) -Rhode Island's attorney general on Monday announced settlements he valued at $107 million against the drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)'s Allergan (NYSE:AGN) unit to resolve claims over their roles in fueling an opioid epidemic in the state.
Attorney General Peter Neronha said the settlements include $28.5 million in cash, plus the delivery to Rhode Island of anti-overdose treatments - 1 million Naloxone sprays and 67,000 bottles of Suboxone pills - over 10 years.
""While no amount of money will ever be enough to undo the harm suffered by Rhode Islanders throughout the ongoing opioid epidemic, these additional recoveries will further support public health efforts to respond to the challenges,"" Neronha said.
Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drug company, called its settlement ""a critical step forward in getting life-saving treatments to the people who need them."" 
It said it was still ""actively"" negotiating a national settlement. Teva Chief Executive Kåre Schultz told Reuters last month the company will likely end up paying $2.7 billion to $3.6 billion in cash and drugs to settle all U.S. state and local government claims. 
AbbVie, which acquired Allergan in 2020, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The settlement was reached just as Rhode Island was prepared to take Teva to trial. Jury selection began last week, and opening arguments were set to begin on Monday. 
The Rhode Island lawsuit is one of more than 3,300 filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments across the country accusing drugmakers of minimizing the addiction risks of opioid pain medications.
More than 500,000 people have died due to opioid overdoses in the past two decades, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Rhode Island valued Teva's contributed medicines at $78.5 million. The company reached a similar $225 million settlement recently with Texas which included $75 million in contributed drugs. 
Concerns about the value of those drugs have been a sticking point in Teva's attempt to reach nationwide settlement agreement. Hunter Shkolnik, a lawyer who represents opioid plaintiffs in other cases, called the use of the list price a ""smoke and mirrors"" technique that artificially inflates the settlement's value.

Vincent Greene, an attorney who represented Rhode Island in the Teva case, said the inclusion of treatment drugs will ""save lives immediately and in the years to come."" Rhode Island has reached all-cash settlements from other defendants, giving the state more flexibility to accept non-cash contributions from Teva, Greene added. 
Other defendants in the Rhode Island case settled long before the trial, including the largest U.S. drug distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH). Those three companies joined a nationwide $21 billion settlement.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 06:01PM ET</span>",Russia finds Meta guilty of 'extremist activity' but WhatsApp can stay,"(Reuters) -A Moscow court said on Monday that Meta was guilty of ""extremist activity"", but the ruling will not affect its WhatsApp messenger service, focusing on the U.S. firm's already-banned Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram social networks.
Meta did not respond to requests for comment after Moscow's Tverskoi District Court said in a press statement that it had upheld a lawsuit filed by state prosecutors on banning the company's activities on Russian territory.
Meta's lawyer Victoria Shakina had earlier told the court that the company was not carrying out extremist activities and was against Russophobia, the Interfax news agency reported.
It was not clear whether Meta would appeal the outlawing of the activities of Facebook and Instagram in Russia ""on the grounds of realising extremist activity"", a ban TASS cited judge Olga Solopova as saying would be enforced immediately.
Late on Monday, communications regulator Roskomnadzor said it will exclude Meta from the list of foreign entities operating on the Internet in Russia, and Instagram and Facebook from the register of social networks, according to news agencies.
Roskomnadzor also said that Russian media must label Meta and its social networks as prohibited when distributing information and are forbidden to display their logos.
Russia has in the past designated groups such as the Taliban and Islamic State as ""extremist"" but later expanded this to the Jehovah's Witnesses and jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation.
Facebook last year had 7.5 million users in Russia and WhatsApp had 67 million, researcher Insider Intelligence estimates, while Instagram has said its ban will affect 80 million users in Russia.
UKRAINE TENSIONS
The implications of the ruling remain unclear as Facebook and Instagram are already banned in Russia and the court said WhatsApp would be unaffected by its ruling. 
""The decision does not apply to the activities of Meta's messenger WhatsApp, due to its lack of functionality for the public dissemination of information,"" the court said. 
Russia initially banned Facebook for restricting access to Russian media while Instagram was blocked earlier this month after Meta said it would allow social media users in Ukraine to post messages urging violence against Russian President Vladimir Putin and troops Moscow sent into Ukraine.
Russia calls the conflict a ""special military operation"" to disarm Ukraine and protect it from people it describes as dangerous nationalists. 
Meta has since narrowed its guidance to prohibit calls for the death of a head of state and said its guidance should never be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general.
But the perceived threat to its citizens angered Russian authorities and led to the criminal case against Meta.
WHATSAPP'S FATE
It was not immediately clear how the WhatsApp messaging service would be able to continue operating, since the court has put a stop to Meta's commercial activities. 
Analysis of mobile internet traffic on Monday showed that Telegram, popular in Russia for a long time, has overtaken WhatsApp to become the country's most used messaging tool in recent weeks.
The prosecution sought to allay fears that people who find ways around bans on Meta's services may face criminal charges.
""Individuals will not be prosecuted simply for using Meta's services,"" TASS cited the prosecutor as saying in court.
But human rights lawyer Pavel Chikov said neither the court nor the prosecutor could guarantee the safety of Facebook or Instagram users, warning that any public displays of Meta symbols - on websites, shop entrances, on business cards - could be grounds for administrative charges and up to 15 days in jail.
""Buying adverts on both social networks or trading Meta's shares may qualify as financing extremism activity - this is a criminal offence,"" he wrote on Telegram. 
WhatsApp may have been left alone due to the extent of its everyday use among Russians and by government agencies and state companies for customer support, Sarkis Darbinyan, head of the legal department at digital rights group Roskomsvoboda, said.
Another reason is likely to be to avoid any backlash.
""The government is trying not to close everything at once, but gradually, so that people slowly get used to it,"" he told Reuters, pointing to the ""unpopular"" closure of Instagram.
""We assume that services like WhatsApp could come under blocks at any moment,"" Darbinyan added.
WAY BACK FOR META?
Russia's military operation in Ukraine has added fuel to a simmering dispute between foreign digital platforms and Moscow.
Access to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has also been restricted and on Friday Roskomnadzor demanded that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google stop spreading what it called threats against Russian citizens on YouTube.
Anton Gorelkin, a member of Russia's State Duma committee on information and communications who has criticised foreign firms, while championing domestic alternatives, said the Russian market could be opened to Meta again, but only on Moscow's terms. 

""These are an immediate end to blocking Russian media, a return to the policy of neutrality, and strict moderation of fakes and anti-Russian comments,"" Gorelkin said on Telegram. 
Another condition, Gorelkin said, was that Meta comply with a law requiring foreign firms with more than 500,000 daily users to open representative offices in Russia.

(Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) must face a Silicon Valley company's claims it illegally monopolized the U.S. market for heart rate monitoring apps for its Apple Watch.
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White said AliveCor Inc, whose SmartRhythm app alerts users to irregular heartbeats, could try to prove that Apple violated federal antitrust law based on its alleged ""complete control"" over the market for such apps.
""AliveCor alleges that Apple made changes to the heart rate algorithm that made it effectively impossible for third parties to inform a user when to take an ECG,"" or electrocardiogram, White wrote. ""Plaintiff's allegations plausibly establish that Apple's conduct was anticompetitive.""
White also dismissed AliveCor's separate claim that Apple maintained an illegal monopoly over ECG-capable smart watches.
The Oakland, California-based judge said this was because AliveCor's KardiaBand wristband, which can record ECGs, ""complements but does not compete"" in that market.
Apple and its lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Adam Wolfson, a lawyer for AliveCor, declined to comment.
In its May 2021 lawsuit, privately held AliveCor accused Apple of changing the heart rate algorithm for the Apple Watch to gain an ""unfair competitive edge"" over rivals, and ""put countless AliveCor users' lives in danger.""

Apple, based in Cupertino, California, countered that it was an ""uncontroversial proposition that product improvement by itself"" did not violate the federal Sherman antitrust law.

Investing.com – Stocks eased off their lows on Monday but still closed down after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could move faster to raise interest rates and tame inflation.
Powell said the Fed could raise rates at a half-point step instead of the usual quarter of a point. Inflation is running at 40-year highs and the central bank is anxious to get it tamed so it won’t hit the economic recovery.
Oil continued to gain, however, something that has exacerbated inflation, especially since the outbreak of Russia’s war in Ukraine.
Reuters reported that Russia's foreign ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan to tell him that remarks by President Joe Biden about his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had pushed bilateral ties to the brink of collapse.
Biden is set to travel to Europe later this week to meet with members of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to discuss the West’s response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. EU members are reportedly mulling a ban on Russian oil imports, though the region is more dependent on the source of energy than the U.S., which has already banned it.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Berkshire deal machine
Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKb) is to acquire Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y) in a deal worth approximately $11.6 billion, putting an end to a long lull in big deals by the conglomerate, which has $140 billion of cash waiting to be put to use.
Berkshire will pay $848.02 per share in cash for the owner of reinsurer TransRe. People will likely speculate on what else Buffett has in his deal pipeline.
2.  Nike  earnings
Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) shares gained 4.9% Monday after the close after it reported earnings that beat analyst expectations for earnings per share and revenue. The company announced earnings per share of 87 cents on revenue of $10.9 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of 71 cents on revenue of $10.63 billion.
Nike’s direct sales rose 17% but its revenue from China, a big source of growth for the athletic apparel maker, fell 5%, to $2.16 billion.
3. Oil prices still in view
European Union countries are meeting Monday ahead of U.S. President Joe Biden’s arrival later this week to take part in a series of summits that aim to harden the West's response to Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Oil prices rose 7% on Monday, to more than $110 a barrel after briefly dipping last week below $100.

The announcement came right after the company met with local government officials.
The funds will be invested in a project at a salt flat called Salar de Hombre Muerto, located in the border between the northern Salta and Catamarca provinces.
Posco expects to initially produce 25,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide, an especially high-demand lithium product for battery makers, there per year, reaching 100,000 tonnes once the venture is completed.
Export value from the project is seen totaling $260 million per year over the next 30 years, according to a statement from President Alberto Fernandez's office.
A spokesman for Posco confirmed the figures in a statement to Reuters.

Argentina is part of the so-called ""lithium triangle,"" which also includes neighbors Bolivia and Chile, home to one of the world's largest lithium reserves.
Posco was initially expected to invest $830 million in the venture, but changes in the original project led it to increase the amount, according to Salta's mining department.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Monday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could lift interest rates more quickly and in larger steps to tame inflation.
Stocks ended last week with outsized gains despite investors keeping a wary eye on the developments in Ukraine and a series of Fed speakers a few days after the central bank started its tightening cycle.
At 4:57 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1%, while the S&P 500 fell 0.6%, and NASDAQ Composite fell 1.1%.
Wall Street's three main indexes notched up last week their largest weekly percentage gains since early November 2020 with the Dow climbing 5.5%, the S&P adding 6.2% and the Nasdaq rising 8.2%.
This followed the Federal Reserve delivering on Wednesday its first rate hike since 2018 along with an encouraging assessment of the U.S. economy. This is widely expected to be the first of a series of hikes, with the central bank pointing to increases at its remaining six meetings this year.
Powell, speaking at the National Association of Business Economists conference, said the Fed could life rates in half-point stages, rather than the customary quarter-point move, setting traders abuzz with the notion that a more aggressive approach to inflation was in the works.
Investors will be looking for the thoughts of Fed officials -- more are also speaking today and this week -- given the concerns over stubbornly high inflation, sky-high commodity prices and few signs of an end to the conflict in eastern Europe.
A Kremlin spokesman said Monday that peace talks have not progressed enough for a meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents to take place. This comes after Ukraine rejected a Russian demand that its forces lay down their arms and leave the besieged southern port of Mariupol. 
The economic data slate is largely empty Monday, but the week as a whole will feature reports on durable goods orders, initial jobless claims, both new and pending home sales, as well as services and manufacturing PMI data.
In corporate news, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) announced earlier Monday it plans to purchase Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y) in an all-cash deal valued at $11.6 billion.
A Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 airliner, but not one its MAX planes, operated by China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) crashed earlier, killing 132 people. Boeing shares fell 4% and helped weigh on the Dow.
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE) is scheduled to release quarterly results after the close Monday, and the sportswear giant’s sales could suffer from the powerful cocktail of rising Covid-19 cases in China, the Russia-Ukraine crisis and lingering supply issues.
Oil prices jumped Monday as the EU meets to consider whether to join the United States in imposing an oil embargo on Russia as the sanctions already levied on Moscow for its invasion have yet to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the fighting.
This would be an economically tough choice, as the EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas, with Germany the most dependent of the bloc's large economies.

Investing.com - Tencent Music Entertainment reported Monday mixed fourth quarter results as earnings beat but revenue fell short of the expectations as increased competition and the weaker macro environment dented growth. 
Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME) was down more than 2% in after-hours trade.
The online music and audio entertainment platform reported adjusted EPS of RMB0.50, down from RMB0.80 a year earlier, as revenue fell 8.7%, to RMB7.607 billion. That compared with Wall Street estimates for EPS of RMB 0.08 on revenue of $7.609 billion.
Online music mobile monthly active users, or MAUs, fell 1% year-over-year, driven by churn in casual users served amid increased competition. But paying online music paying users reached a record-high 76.2 million, benefitting from expanded sales channels and paying user loyalty, the company said.  
""Amid increasing competition and changing macro environment, social entertainment services MAUs and paying users were lower year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter,"" it added.

Nearly a dozen Apple services were down for thousands of users.
The company's system status page had showed 11 outages including podcasts, music and arcade. It said Apple was investigating the issue and services may be slow or unavailable. 
According to outage tracking website Downdetector.com, more than 4,000 users reported issues with accessing Apple Music, while nearly 4,000 reported problems with iCloud.
Users also flagged issues with ""find my iPhone"", Apple store, maps and support.
Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from several sources including user-submitted errors on its platform. The outage may be affecting a larger number of users. 
The company was responding to affected users on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) but it was unclear what caused the outages.
Bloomberg News reported that Apple's corporate staff working from home and retail workers were also facing issues. The outage delayed product repairs, pickups and limited workers' access to internal websites, the report said.

According to the report, Apple told staff that the outage stemmed from domain name system, or DNS - an address book of the internet which enables computers to match website addresses with the correct server.
In a number of incidents last year, DNS issues caused widespread outages on social media platforms including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram, and brought down websites of airlines and banks for several hours.

BOSTON (Reuters) -U.S. stocks declined broadly while oil prices and Treasury yields pushed higher on Monday as investors refocused on risks from conflict in Ukraine and the U.S. Federal Reserve's actions on inflation.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 201.94 points, or 0.58%, to 34,552.99, the S&P 500 lost 1.94 points, or 0.04%, to 4,461.18 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 55.38 points, or 0.4%, to 13,838.46.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell by 3.6% after one of its 737 jets crashed in China.
Global stock markets rallied last week in anticipation of an eventual peace deal on Ukraine. But on Monday, Ukraine defied a Russian ultimatum that its forces lay down arms in Mariupol, while the European Union considered a possible energy embargo against Russia.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.04% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.24%.
""The market is digesting the impact of tighter financial conditions, higher oil prices and continued geopolitical uncertainty against a backdrop of growth, at least in the U.S.,"" Erin Browne, a portfolio manager for multi-asset strategies at PIMCO in Newport Beach, California, said in an email. 
She added, though, that the U.S. market will continue to benefit from outflows from the rest of the world given its relative insulation from oil and geopolitical tensions.
BofA's global fund manager survey last week had a bearish bias with cash levels the highest since April 2020 and global growth expectations the lowest since the financial crisis of 2008. Long oil and commodities were the most crowded trade, and vulnerable to a pullback.
EYES ON THE FED
The U.S. central bank must move quickly to bring too-high inflation to heel, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Monday, adding that it could use bigger-than-usual interest rate hikes if needed to do so.
""The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high,"" Powell told a National Association for Business Economics conference. ""There is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if that is what is required to restore price stability.""
Fed policymakers last week raised interest rates for the first time in three years, and most see the short-term policy rate - pinned for two years near zero - at 1.9% by the end of this year, a pace that could be achieved with quarter-percentage-point increases at each of their next six policy meetings. 
Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic also said on Monday he had penciled in a total of eight interest rate hikes for this year and the next, fewer than most of his colleagues as he worries about the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on the U.S. economy. 
Following Powell's comments, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 2.307%, while the yield on two-year notes increased to 2.132%. It was the first time since May 2019 that the two-year note, which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations, topped 2% - the Fed's target rate for inflation.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) rate strategists are calling for the closely watched 2-year/10-year U.S. Treasury yield curve to invert in the second quarter. ""While this doesn't guarantee a recession, the signal on growth is clearly negative,"" they wrote in a note.
The dollar also strengthened against a basket of major currencies on Monday in the wake of Powell's comments. The dollar index steadied at 98.49, off its recent peak hit earlier in March at 99.415. The euro fell about 0.3% to $1.105, after jumping 1.3% last week.

Investing.com --  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) shares gained 4.9% Monday after the close after it reported earnings that beat analyst expectations for earnings per share and revenue.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has settled with six current and former employees who had alleged the company unfairly stifled worker organizing in a case stemming from potential sales of its cloud technology to U.S. immigration authorities -- an abrupt ending to a trial that had been paused for several months.
The U.S. National Labor Relations Board had pursued the case on behalf of the workers and brought Google before an administrative law judge last year. Weeks of hearings were then stopped pending resolution of a dispute over whether the NLRB could force Google legal chief Kent Walker to testify.
Laurie Burgess, an attorney representing the workers, said they had grown emotionally exhausted from fighting Google. They had to weigh that against wanting to reveal additional ""juicy"" evidence about Project Vivian, Google's effort to quell worker activism, she said.
""We exposed enough, and it’s time for my clients to be able to move on with their lives,"" Burgess said.
The workers independently settled with Google last Wednesday, the NLRB did not object and the judge in San Francisco dismissed the case last Friday, legal filings show. The settlement was first reported on Monday by Vice.
Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A parallel lawsuit in California state court also was dismissed.
The case had concerned Google's actions against workers who were among a larger group protesting the company's cloud technology relationship with U.S. immigration authorities in 2019.
Google interrogated workers and fired some of them, aiming to dissuade people from engaging in legally protected concerted activities, the government said. 
The company denied wrongdoing, arguing that the employees it fired or suspended were accessing files they should not have and had no right to dictate with whom the company does business.
Google said on Monday it was pleased everyone avoided years of legal proceedings. 

""We've always supported our employees' right to speak about working conditions, and we stand by our policies that protect the security of our systems and safeguard user, customer and employee data,"" Google said.
Worker activism across Silicon Valley has been on the rise for years. Hundreds of Google workers last year formed a small labor organization in hopes of better protecting their rights in future protests.

496,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 03:18PM ET</span>",‘Waking Everyone Up’: Wall Street Reacts to Powell’s Hawkishness,"(Bloomberg) -- Just in case financial markets didn’t get Jerome Powell’s hawkish message last week, they got it Monday when he made it abundantly clear that the Federal Reserve is coming hard for inflation, even if it means slowing the economy.
The reaction on Wall Street was swift. Stocks gave up gains and slid more than 1%, while Treasuries extended losses that took the two-year Treasury yield past 2.1%. But just like last Wednesday, an initial freakout turned into a more benign decline, with the S&P 500 down just 0.3% as of 2:50 p.m. in New York.
Here’s what traders and money managers were saying about the market’s relative resilience in the face of a hawkish central bank.
Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA:
“I think it’s pretty consistent. He’s always been sort of a data person. He is letting us know that he’s not influenced by politics. Really, the direction is from the data. Hearing him say that sentence would not have been a surprise to me. So, I’m sort of surprised that the market is surprised. The Fed has already told us that it’s going to likely raise rates by seven times this year and then a terminal rate of 2.75%. We already know that. I sort of feel as if the market’s response has more to do with digesting the gains from last week because we had four consecutive days.”
Mike Bailey, director of research at FBB Capital Partners:
“Powell is waking everyone up after investors got comfortable with a narrative that the Fed’s got your back. Last week, investors gravitated to a theme of a soft landing, with the Fed as the wizard behind the curtain. But this week, Powell is back saying hold on, the Fed’s main focus is jobs and inflation, and risky assets are secondary. Perhaps Powell is trying to steer investor sentiment away from a ‘buy anything’ mentality, which started to catch fire last week.”
Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index:
“Fed Chair Powell is clearly on a mission to bring down inflation this year, and is prepared to take aggressive action if deemed necessary. With robust economic growth and a strong labor market Powell has good reason to think that the economy can handle a steep path to policy normalization. The USD has barely reacted to the comments, mainly because he reiterated the message from last week. The Fed could well try and front load the rate hikes, because the longer the Ukraine war continues, the greater the uncertainty and the bigger the risk to global economic growth.”
Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investments:
“He is reiterating the shift in primary policy imperatives that he laid out last week, essentially shifting from a ‘jobs at any cost’ monetary policy stance to a ‘kill inflation at any cost’ stance. I think it is as short-sighted as labeling inflation ‘transitory’ nine months ago, but that is the tack they are clearly taking, so doesn’t really matter whether anyone thinks it is right or wrong. Global economy is already slowing and supply chains are already easing, but they are hell-bent on making it clear to the market that their only job right now is to bring down current readings of CPI. If they have to reverse course and deal with a mild recession in 6-12 months, they’ll just have to do that.”
John Roque, head of technical strategy at 22V Research:
“My only comment is that I’m sure Jay Powell got tired of reading comments saying that the market was not taking him and the Fed seriously on their desire to attack inflation.”
Kim Forrest, founder and chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners: 
“I am not alarmed at what Powell said. He is reiterating the Fed’s dependence on data to inform their moves. I think he talked about the 50 basis-point increases as an example of what they might have to do – not what they are going to do. He ran through the risks that the markets are facing and it was reasonable. Finally, although the Fed’s rates certainly drove asset prices higher in the past two years, they are not really the drivers of the increasing prices of goods and services.”

""The exchange will be possible at a rounded, official ... exchange rate,"" the bank said in a statement. 
Last week the bank said it was cooperating with the country's largest lender, PKO BP (NYSE:BP), to allow refugees who have fled Ukraine for Poland to convert hryvnia. 

Many refugees are struggling to buy even basic necessities because their savings in hryvnia are non-convertible across most of Europe, meaning they have no way to exchange them at reasonable rates.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 02:41PM ET</span>","Soccer-Chelsea bidders shortlist to be cut to three, Candy increases bid","By Peter Hall
MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Raine Group, the U.S. bank overseeing the sale of Premier League club Chelsea, plans to narrow down the shortlist of bidders to three on Monday or Tuesday, sources told Reuters, with one consortium lead by Nick Candy increasing their offer.
Chelsea were initially put up for sale by owner Roman Abramovich following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and before sanctions were imposed on the oligarch by the British government, effectively giving it control of the club.
Raine set a deadline of 2100 GMT last Friday for bids to be put forward, with several being made public, while sources close to the deal said many more had been submitted privately.
To move things forward, Reuters has been told that Raine, in consultation with the club, will narrow down the shortlist, with the process slowed by revised bids still coming in.
One of the three bidders who made their offers public on Friday, Candy's Blue Football consortium, revised their bid on Monday, they told Reuters in a statement, after being joined by ""another large Korean financial institution.""
British property developer Candy submitted a bid of over two billion pounds ($2.63 billion) to Raine on Friday, but has since increased his offer ""significantly"", without disclosing by how much or the name of the new investor.
He had already been joined in his consortium by South Korean companies Hana Financial Group and C&P Sports Limited before the new investors got on board. 
""The Blue Football Consortium has access to immediate capital with funds readily available for deployment from day one,"" Brian Gordon, partner of Squire Patton Boggs, the law firm working with the Blue Football Consortium, said. 
""The bid is sourced from credible co-venturers whose attitude towards governance is top rated.""
PREFERRED BUYERS
Over the next few weeks, a preferred buyer or buyers will be submitted to the government who must issue a special licence for any sale and who require evidence that Abramovich will not make any financial gain.
From there it will be up to the prospective buyer to pass the Premier League's Owners' and Directors' Test before completing a takeover.
The test outlines factors that would prohibit an individual from becoming an owner or director of a club.
These include criminal convictions for a wide range of offences, a ban by a sporting or professional body and breaches of certain key football regulations, such as match-fixing.
Along with Candy's bid, the two other consortiums who made their offers public last week were the Chicago Cubs owners the Ricketts family, and the pairing of former Liverpool chairman Martin Broughton and World Athletics President Sebastian Coe.
Some bids are only being made public now, with London-based global investment firm Centricus confirming on Monday that they had offered to buy Chelsea, a move driven by co-founder Nizar Al-Bassam and CEO Garth Ritchie, who are said to be season-ticket holders.
British media reports have named several other bidders, including Saudi Media, headed by businessman Mohamed Alkhereiji.

Candy's bid, while not assured of being on the shortlist, said on Monday that they had held initial discussions with tech platform PrimaryBid, with a view to potentially considering a community enfranchisement model for Chelsea, should the bid be successful, focused on improving fan involvement and engagement.

In a court filing, the Justice Department asked for Google to be sanctioned for creating a ""Communicate with Care"" program that trains workers to include an attorney and a request for advice when writing about sensitive business matters. 
""Often, knowing the game, the in-house counsel included in these Communicate-with-Care emails does not respond at all,"" the department said, adding that many of the emails had to do with revenue share agreements that Google had struck with other companies.
A Google spokesperson said that the company had given the government more than 4 million documents. ""Our teams have conscientiously worked for years to respond to inquiries and litigation, and suggestions to the contrary are flatly wrong,"" the spokesperson said.

The Justice Department asked for the documents to be produced if the in-house counsel did not reply. It asked U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta to hold a hearing to discuss the matter.

501,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 02:41PM ET</span>",Amazon union backers see bright future for organizing despite tough odds,"By Julia Love and Jeffrey Dastin
BESSEMER, Al. (Reuters) - Workers at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) seeking to organize a warehouse in Alabama after a bruising defeat last year have been invigorated by a resurgent labor movement, bringing energy to the campaign despite the long odds they face.
The vote by Bessemer warehouse employees concludes this month after the U.S. National Labor Relations Board found Amazon improperly interfered in the previous union election.
Given the retail giant's two-to-one margin of victory in the original contest, the workers trying to bring the first-ever union to a U.S. Amazon warehouse face a tall order.
Yet since the last vote, the American labor movement has gained momentum, motivated by the high-profile Alabama campaign, ongoing pandemic concerns and strikes.
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has vowed to implement policies to make it easier for workers to organize. Approval for unions is the highest since 1965, a Gallup poll showed last year.
Amazon employee Braxton Wright, 39, said that while he was hopeful for a win, even a near miss for the union in Bessemer would help others see that organizing is possible.
Simply by casting ballots, ""You give more people the courage to stand up and say, 'Hey, we want to form a union,'"" Wright said.
Labor activity is already escalating at Amazon facilities beyond Bessemer. Led by former Amazon worker Christian Smalls, staff at two New York warehouses have received authorization from the NLRB to hold union votes, including one this month.
That enthusiasm has spread to other union-resistant brands, including Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). In the last seven months, workers from more than 140 Starbucks stores have asked for union elections.
AMAZON'S MESSAGE
The Bessemer warehouse's union backers say organizing under the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) will help them counter productivity targets that are hard to meet and advocate for better working conditions at Amazon, which data shows had injury rates above average for U.S. warehouses in 2020.
For Amazon, unions threaten to alter how the online retailer manages its vast operation and drive up labor costs beyond what the company said was $4 billion in extra expenses related to a worker shortage last quarter.
With those stakes and businesses across America competing for workers, Amazon increased spending on digital ads touting its jobs, pay and benefits seven-fold through mid-February from the same period in 2021, to $2.8 million, according to marketing intelligence firm Pathmatics. The data excludes ads, if any, on video streaming services. Near the Bessemer warehouse, the company used a billboard to urge workers to vote.
""I see their ads every single day,"" said Roger Wyatt, a 34-year-old worker at the facility who is voting for the union. Amazon last year advertised to workers as well, unrelated to conduct the NLRB deemed improper.
Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel has said workers' safety is a top priority and that the company is investing heavily to help staff. Regarding the union contests in Alabama and New York, she said, ""We look forward to having our employees' voices heard in these elections, and our focus remains on working directly with our team to make Amazon a great place to work.""
'THERE'S A HUNGER'
Employee Eli Morrison needs no persuading. He disapproved of a union at a prior job and has already mailed in his vote against bringing one to the Bessemer warehouse.
""I love the work – I don't even feel like I work,"" he said.
Such distrust of unions is still common among workers, fanned by Amazon itself, which has warned in meetings staff were obliged to attend that labor groups could mandate strikes or shrink pay, something the RWDSU has disputed.
Wright, a miner who took a job at Amazon last year while on strike at Warrior Met Coal (NYSE:HCC), is among the activists trying to change that. 
Showing up for work in union gear, he has been outspoken on the warehouse floor. Union supporters on the whole have been more vocal this time around, pushing back against Amazon's talking points in meetings, said worker Darryl Richardson, 52. 
Across the country, more Amazon workers are putting pressure on their employer. In New York, employees have raised money on GoFundMe and collected signatures to persuade Amazon to drop charges against organizers. Workers from several sites likewise petitioned the company after a tornado tore through an Illinois warehouse in December, killing six workers. In Bessemer, staff in the shipping dock department circulated a petition calling for better working conditions, which the RWDSU said collected more than 100 signatures.
""There's a hunger for innovative approaches,"" said Wilma Liebman, a former NLRB chair during the Obama administration. ""All this activism is going to continue for a while.""

Richardson said he senses the tide is turning for workers.
""Everybody around the world is standing up,"" he said.

BOEING 737-800
The Boeing 737-800 is part of the 737 family, the world's most-flown commercial aircraft series. It was developed in the 1960s to serve short- or medium-length routes.
The 737-800 is part of the 737 NG or Next-Generation family - with more than 7,000 delivered since 1993 - and it has a strong safety record after nearly three decades of flights. The 162- to 189-seat 737-800 was launched on Sept. 5, 1994. The NG is the predecessor to the 737 MAX.
The MAX was grounded worldwide for 20 months after two fatal crashes killed 346. It remains grounded in China.
The jet involved in the China Eastern accident, en route from the southwestern city of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, to Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, was six years old, according to Flightradar24.
In the United States, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) has the most 737-800s in operation with 265 followed by Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) with 205 and United Airlines with 136, according to Cirium data.
The last fatal 737-800 crash occurred in August 2020 when an Air India Express plane overshot the table-top runway and crashed while landing at Calicut International Airport in the southern state of Kerala in heavy rain, killing 21. A government report cited pilot error as the probable cause.
CHINA 
China's airline safety record has been among the best in the world for a decade but is less transparent than in countries like the United States and Australia where regulators release detailed reports on non-fatal incidents.
According to Aviation Safety Network, China's last fatal jet accident was in 2010, when 44 of 96 people on board were killed when an Embraer E-190 regional jet flown by Henan Airlines crashed on approach to Yichun airport.
In 1994, a China Northwest Airlines Tupolev Tu-154 crashed en route from Xian to Guangzhou, killing all 160 on board in China's worst-ever air disaster, according to Aviation Safety Network.
Monday's disaster was the first fatal crash for China Eastern since 2004, when a plane crashed shortly after it took off from an airport in north China, killing 55, according to ASN.
Shanghai-based China Eastern was created in 1988 and is one of the largest three airlines in China, with one of the youngest fleet of planes.
It is part of the SkyTeam Alliance and U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) holds a 2% stake. China Eastern has ranked in recent years among the ten largest carriers in total passengers carried. Delta has ""a strategic joint marketing and commercial cooperation arrangement covering traffic flows between China and the U.S."" 

Passenger traffic between China and the United States has declined dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic.

The U.S. automaker said it will idle its German plants in Saarlouis and Cologne, mostly due to the global chip shortage. That also led it to stop taking new orders for the S-Max and Galaxy vehicles built in Valencia, Spain. Ford said it has orders for both products that take it beyond September and that existing orders will be fulfilled.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine also has caused parts shortages at a Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) plant in Poland that builds Ford's Tourneo Connect vehicle, leading to a temporary halt of production, Ford said.

""We continue to monitor the situation on a daily basis in conjunction with our partners at VW and will have more to say on this at a later date,"" Ford said in a statement. 
The Ukraine conflict has also led to supply issues that have forced Ford to offer consumers the Focus car with a smaller, 8-inch dashboard screen, instead of the 13.2-inch SYNC4 screen that was part of the updated vehicle's introduction, the company said, without providing details. Supply of the larger screen is being moved to a new location in Europe, but until then only the smaller screen will be available.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy is ready to fund as much as 40% of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s total investment to build a chip packaging and assembly plant in the country, worth an initial $5 billion but which is expected to rise over time, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The plan by Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government shows the willingness of some European member states to offer competitive terms to woo Intel and other chipmakers to invest in a region where labour and production costs are higher than in Asia.
Draghi's office and the innovation ministry both declined to comment.
Intel last week outlined the first details of an $88 billion investment drive across Europe, which is striving to cut its reliance on Asian chip imports and ease a supply crunch that has curbed output in the region's strategic car sector.
The plan, with an initial expenditure of 33 billion euros ($36.4 billion), is centred on a huge new chipmaking complex in Germany, and includes an advanced packaging and assembly site in Italy with a potential investment of up to 4.5 billion euros.
The Italian facility, which is expected to start operations between 2025 and 2027, would create about 1,500 direct jobs and an additional 3,500 jobs among suppliers and partners.
Offering 40% of Intel's total capex in Italy would make it competitive with similar investments the chipmaker has made in other regions such as Asia, the two sources said, declining to be identified due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The government is in talks with the European Union, which will have to give its green light on state aid offered by member states to Intel, one of the sources said.
""It will be for Brussels to eventually decide how much, but I think Italy will contribute 30-40% of the total investment, probably something closer to 40%,"" the source added.
Intel declined to comment on the specifics of the deal, but reiterated that it, along with Italy, aims to make its planned facility a first of its kind in the EU.
LEVELLING THE FIELD
It is not yet clear how Italy plans to provide the funding. Rome has so far set aside 4.15 billion euros until 2030 to attract chipmakers and invest in new industrial applications of innovative technologies.
To clinch a deal with Intel, it is relying on new funding rules for innovative semiconductor facilities announced last month by the European Commission under the so-called Chips Act.
Brussels has made available 15 billion euros in additional public and private investment by 2030, on top of 30 billion euros of public investments already planned from NextGenerationEU, Horizon Europe and national budgets.
Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger last week said the European Union could help level the cost playing field with Asia, but declined to give more detail.
Gelsinger said Intel wanted to spend the remaining money from its planned 80 billion euro investment over the next 10 years to build out the complete German site and further develop facilities in other countries including Italy.
""The government aims to convince Intel to even double its investment in Italy over time, from the initial 4.5 billion euros,"" the source said.
The source added that Rome had identified five potential sites in Italy where Intel could build its new advanced packaging and assembly facility, in the Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto, Apulia and Sicily regions.

""The aim is to have a shortlist with two potential alternatives within a month,"" the source said. ""Then it will be (for) Intel to decide where to build it"".

510,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 01:00PM ET</span>",Bullish Signals for Stocks Emerge Under Market’s Gloomy Surface,"(Bloomberg) -- While U.S. stocks were flip-flopping in morning trading Monday, there are signs that investors are getting more bullish and snapping up beaten-down stocks.
The S&P 500 Index is coming off its best week since November 2020, having posted four consecutive days of more than 1% gains for just the fifth time in history, according to LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA). Historically, that has been encouraging for the stock market, as each time it’s happened the S&P has climbed more than 20% over the ensuing year, with an average return of 28%.
The key is its breadth also looks strong. Clusters of “breadth thrusts,” which occur when an extreme number of stocks advance rather than decline in a short period of time, have appeared. Technical analysts say these moves tend to happen around the beginning of new uptrends for equities.
That said, investors still appear to be defensive in their buying. Market strength has been led by sectors usually perceived as havens, like energy, health care, utilities and real estate. In fact,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said last week’s rebound offers a good opportunity to sell and position more defensively. 
Read: Morgan Stanley’s Wilson Says This Is a Bear Market Rally to Sell
Here’s a look at what market breadth is telling investors about the trajectory of the U.S. stock market: 
Breadth Thrusts Pop Up
Nearly 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 traded above their 10-day moving averages on Friday. Since 1982, the broad index has been higher over the next year in 35 out of the 36 times when more than 90% of its stocks trade above their 10-day moving averages, according to Ned Davis Research. The firm’s version of the Zweig Thrust Indicator, which occurs when the barometer rises from below 40% to above 61.5% in a 10-day period, hit that level on Friday for common stocks only.
Taking Stock of Volume
While stocks have started to advance, market technicians want to see the moves supported by volume rather than just a handful of companies pushing major indexes higher. The Arms Index, also called the Short-Term Trading Index, or TRIN, is an indicator that compares the number of advancing and declining stocks to advancing and declining volume. 
Read: Waiting on Capitulation? Technicians Urge Patience: Taking Stock
Readings below 0.5 in the Arms Index suggest there is more demand for stocks, while readings above 2.0 are a sign that investors are dumping equities, according to Todd Sohn, managing director of technical strategy at Strategas. On March 2, it fell to 0.55, but on Friday it sat at 1.28, meaning another bout of selling may be on tap before the market has its final washout. 
Momentum Signals
Less than a third of S&P 500 stocks are trading at 20-day highs, and that figure would need to expand beyond 50% for traders to believe momentum is improving, Sohn said. Strategists are also looking for the percentage of stocks trading above their 20-day moving average, which stood at 84% Friday, to climb above 90%.

Investing.com -- Shares of Chinese electric vehicle company Nio Inc (NYSE:NIO) fell over 3% Monday ahead of its earnings release later this week. 
The company, which has seen its share price decline 35% in 2022, is set to report earnings after the bell Thursday. 
Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu cut the firm's price target on NIO to $50 from $70, despite providing positive commentary on the company in a note to investors. 
Yu explained in a research note that NIO has ""cultivated an aspirational premium brand, underpinned by a leading service infrastructure that no domestic automaker has been able to match.""
The analyst pointed to operational bottlenecks stagnating the company's volumes in the last few quarters but added that NIO's deliveries are on track to increase from 10,000 per month to 25,000 at the end of the year.
Yu said NIO's ET7 and ET5 models will be the most desired cars in China this year. "

(Reuters) -Volkswagen AG plans to invest at least $7.1 billion over the next five years in North America and add 25 new electric vehicles there by 2030, including a recreation of VW's classic Microbus, a top executive said on Monday.
The latter model, called ID.Buzz, is a centerpiece of the plan. It will be imported initially from VW's Hanover plant in Germany, but ultimately could be assembled in the United States or Mexico, according to Scott Keogh, president and CEO of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group of America.
U.S. demand for the ID.Buzz is ""through the roof,"" Keogh said at a media briefing on Monday. The upshot is that ""there could be an opportunity"" to build the vehicle in North America, he said.
VW's North American investment plan is part of a broader five-year global spending plan, announced in December, that earmarks $98 billion for ""e-mobility, hybridization and digitalization,"" including construction of battery plants and partnerships with battery material suppliers.
The North American figure does not include a provision of $1.8 billion or more for additional local battery production to supplement battery cells that VW is buying from SK Innovation's Georgia plants, Keogh said. VW aims to establish dedicated cell production to support its ambitious electric vehicle rollout in the region, he said.
The German automaker expects at least 50% of its U.S. vehicle sales to be fully electric by 2030, Keogh said. That compares with a 70% target for electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.
VW will begin to phase out its gasoline-powered models in North America, with the aim of exiting sales of combustion-engine vehicles early in the next decade.

VW has begun pilot production of the ID.4 electric crossover at its Chattanooga plant in Tennessee, in preparation for a fall launch, and is upgrading its Mexican plants in Puebla and Silao to starting building electric vehicles, motors and related components by mid-decade.
Keogh said VW expects to add as many as four electric SUVs to its U.S. portfolio, starting in 2026, that would cover the same segments now served by gasoline-powered models, including Taos, Tiguan and Atlas (NYSE:ATCO).

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian luxury sports car brand Lamborghini can easily make up for lost sales from its decision to suspend business in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Chief Executive Stephan Winkelmann said on Monday.
Winkelmann said Lamborghini, part of the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group through Audi, sold a record of around 200 cars in Russia last year, out of a record of 8,405 globally. 
""The cars we have planned to produce for Russia this year can be easily absorbed by other markets,"" he said in a web press conference.
""We're waiting to see how the situation evolves in Ukraine, but if it does not change we'll have no problem to absorb that demand, thanks to our strong order book and waiting lists.""
Lamborghini plans to start offering hybrid vehicles from next year and make its entire lineup - the Huracan and Aventador sports cars and the Urus sport utility vehicle (SUV) - plug-in hybrid between the end of 2024 and 2025. 
Its first full-electric vehicle will follow in the second half of the decade. Its production is expected to take place at the brand's historic headquarters near Bologna, northern Italy, Winkelmann said.
""There is room here to increase production,"" he said, without providing a target on Lamborghini future car output.

The carmaker will present during this year two new versions of the Huracan and a 'face lift' of Urus, Winkelmann said.
Lamborghini posted a margin on its operating profit of 20.2% last year versus a target of between 22%-25% for the coming years, the CEO said.

The London-listed company said there were no reasons for it to default, adding that the issuer had sufficient liquidity to complete the coupon payments. 
It said the paying agent for the coupon, Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK), had told Evraz it had not received the funds, which remained ""blocked for compliance"" at Evraz's correspondent bank, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) New York.
SocGen in NY did not immediately respond to request for comment.
The coupon is on Evraz's dollar bond maturing in March 2023. The issue last traded on Monday at 64 cents in the dollar
Britain imposed sanctions on Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea soccer club, on March 10, freezing his assets and preventing him from travelling to Britain. 
Evraz reiterated its position that Abramovich, who owns a 28.64% stake, does not have effective control of the company, and it believes that it is neither designated nor sanctioned.

Evraz said it had sought clarity and confirmation from Britain's Treasury and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office about the matter.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) said its antibody-based cocktail to prevent and treat COVID-19 was shown to retain neutralising activity against Omicron coronavirus variants, including the highly contagious BA.2 sub-variant, in an independent lab study.
Data from the study by the Washington University showed the therapy reduced the amount of virus detected in samples of all tested Omicron subvariants in mice lungs, the London-listed drugmaker said on Monday. The study has yet to be peer reviewed. 
The therapy, Evusheld, was tested against the BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2 subvariants of Omicron and it was also shown to limit inflammation in the lungs.
""The findings further support Evusheld as a potential important option to help protect vulnerable patients such as the immunocompromised who could face poor outcomes if they were to become infected with COVID-19,"" senior AstraZeneca executive John Perez said. 
The World Health Organization said last week figures showing a global rise in COVID-19 cases could herald a much bigger problem, as the Omicron and BA.2 variants spread amid the easing of restrictions and testing.

Vaccines rely on an intact immune system to develop targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells, but Evusheld contains lab-made antibodies designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection.
The results come after Britain last week approved the therapy for preventing infections in adults with poor immune response. Evusheld is currently under a European review and has been authorised in the United States.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) President Mark Reuss said Monday the automaker is confident in its 2022 outlook and its plans to accelerate the launch of a new Cadillac electric vehicle, despite intensifying global supply chain risks.
The geopolitical risks posed to automotive supply chains by the war in Ukraine are real, Reuss said during a conference call. But GM is managing the pressure, and is pushing ahead with its plans to speed up launches of new electric vehicles such as the Cadillac Lyriq, he said.
""We are not new to this game,"" Reuss said. GM has long-term contracts for materials, and multiple sources of supply, he said. ""We never have one answer.""
Reuss said GM has not changed its 2022 financial outlook, which called for operating profit this year of $13 billion to $15 billion, following a record $14.3 billion in operating profit for 2021.
Some rival automakers have hiked prices on their electric vehicles, or warned that 2022 financial projections are at risk because of higher oil prices and surges in prices for materials such as aluminum, neon and nickel hit by Western sanctions on Russia.
GM on Monday formally launched production of its Cadillac Lyriq electric utility vehicle at its complex in Spring Hill, Tennessee. The Lyriq, a compact utility vehicle, will compete with the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y, the best-selling vehicle in Tesla Inc's EV market leading lineup.
Reuss and other GM officials said consumer interest in the Lyriq is stronger than expected, with more than 240,000 people expressing interest. 
Cadillac will allow customers to place firm orders for the 2023 Lyriq starting May 19.
""We are looking to accelerate production,"" GM Vice President for Cadillac Rory Harvey said on Monday's call.
Reuss said the Spring Hill plant will have the parts and materials needed to ramp up Lyriq output, and could build as many as 200,000 Lyriqs a year. But he said the plant also needs to keep making combustion engine SUVs and save room for additional EV models.

Over the past year, consumer demand for EVs and aggressive moves by rival Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co have pushed GM to accelerate its plans to build electric vehicles in high volume. 
GM said earlier this year it now plans to build 400,000 electric vehicles this year and next.

Investing.com --  Neurosense Therapeutics  Ltd (NASDAQ:NRSN), a company developing treatments for severe neurodegenerative diseases, rocketed over 290% higher Monday after announcing it has received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to initiate a pharmacokinetic study of PrimeC.
PrimeC is a drug designed to target key components of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and potentially inhibit the progression. PrimeC is comprised of two FDA-approved drugs: ciprofloxacin and celecoxib.
The drug was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency.
NeuroSense completed a Phase 2a clinical study that met safety and efficacy endpoints, including reducing functional and respiratory deterioration.
The company now plans to initiate a Phase 2b multinational study in the second quarter.
""Data from our Phase IIa clinical study confirmed that PrimeC is a novel therapy with the potential to help people with ALS and address a $3 billion market in need of a more effective treatment,"" said NeuroSense CEO Alon Ben-Noon."

The Irish airline, Europe's largest by passenger numbers, committed last year to power 12.5% of its flights with sustainable aviation fuels by 2030, although Chief Executive Michael O'Leary has since said he is not sure Ryanair will reach the ""very ambitious target.""
Sustainable jet fuel generally produces up to 70% less carbon than fossil fuels, offering airlines a way to become greener while continuing to fly, before less carbon-intensive hybrid, electric or hydrogen aeroplane options become available from the late 2030s.
The budget carrier said on Monday that its order of 210 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jets, which use around 16% less fuel than the current generation of 737s while squeezing in 4% more passengers, will help it meet 32% of its decarbonisation target.
Critics say the low-cost business model encourages people to fly more frequently and drives growth in the total number of people flying. 
Ryanair plans to grow from flying around 150 million passengers per year before the COVID-19 pandemic to 225 million by 2026, although it predicts that total short-haul capacity in Europe is likely to be lower after the pandemic.

Offsetting measures, which Ryanair said will include carbon capture offset projects and supporting government policies and reforms, will contribute a further 24%.
One such reform, an overhaul of the European Union's air traffic management agreed by member states last year, will take care of the final 10% of Ryanair's decarbonisation target, the airline estimated.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday unveiled a landmark proposal requiring public companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and other climate change-related risks in their periodic filings, such as annual reports.
Here are the highlights of the proposal, which is subject to public comment and will likely be finalized later in the year. 
CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS
Overall, the rule requires U.S.-listed companies to disclose climate-related risks and their ""actual or likely material impacts"" on the company's business, strategy and outlook. 
That could include the physical risks posed by climate change, such as flooding or wildfires, but also risks that may result from government policies aimed at mitigating climate risks, such as a carbon tax or other new regulations. 
CLIMATE RISK GOVERNANCE 
Companies will also have to disclose their governance processes and framework for managing climate-related risks. 
That would include, for example, the risk-management controls and processes they have in place; what the board is doing to oversee those processes; and the company's ""processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks.""
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
Companies will have to disclose the greenhouse gas emissions they generate both directly and indirectly from purchased electricity and other forms of energy, known as Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, respectively. 
Companies will also have to disclose the indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities in their value chains, known as Scope 3 emissions, ""if material"" or if they have a greenhouse gas emissions target that includes Scope 3 emissions. Smaller companies will be exempt from this requirement. 
CLIMATE TARGETS, TRANSITION PLANS
Companies that have publicly declared climate-related targets or goals must provide details, including ""the scope of activities and emissions included in the target,"" the deadline, any interim targets, and how they plan to meet their goals. 
If the company has adopted a transition plan as part of its climate-related risk management strategy, it must disclose ""a description of the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage any physical and transition risks."" 

CLIMATE FINANCIAL REPORTING
The disclosures would be included in companies' registration statements and annual reports, as well as in a note appended to consolidated financial statements.

Reports last week revealed Elliott Management was part of a private-equity group in advanced discussions to acquire Nielsen for around $15 billion, including debt.

MADRID (Reuters) - Apollo Infrastructure, a unit of investment firm Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc, has agreed to buy a stake in Spanish road freight operator Primafrio, the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters Apollo was taking a 49% stake in a transaction that valued the family-owned company at around 1.5 billion euros ($1.66 billion). 
The founding Conesa Alcaraz family said in the statement it would retain a majority holding and continue to lead the business, which exports fruit and vegetables from Spain and Portugal to other European countries. 
The company is branching out to higher-margin sectors including retail and pharmaceuticals as high energy prices squeeze profitability for transport and logistics services.
Fuel costs swelled to equal 17% of Primafrio's revenue in 2020, even before an energy price spike prompted by economic recovery from COVID-19 shutdowns was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Primafrio had originally planned an initial public offering it hoped would have valued the firm at $2 billion, but scrapped this last June blaming negative market conditions.
Apollo's co-head of Global Infrastructure Dylan Foo said the deal had been clinched by ""navigating the current market volatility"", adding his firm was ""attracted to the scale, resiliency, and operational excellence of Primafrio"".
The company made a margin on core earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of nearly 18% in 2020, according to the prospectus for that deal. 
Primafrio was advised by Evercore Partners (NYSE:EVR) International and Linklaters. Ashurst LLP and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP advised Apollo Infrastructure.

Controlled by the family of Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, MFE sees building a continental TV champion as the answer to challenges posed to traditional broadcasters by streaming giants and online advertising platforms.
Previously known as Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), it announced last week that it already had a voting stake of more than 25% in ProSiebenSat.1. after its first investment in 2019
Were it to surpass a 30% stake, MFE would have to make a mandatory offer to the remaining ProSieben shareholders according to German law. 
""Currently, we have no such plans. What will be in a year's time, we will see then,"" Giordani was quoted as saying by Handelsblatt on Monday.
MFE has repeatedly called for closer cooperation with the Munich-based group as well as asking it to engage in talks over strategy, focusing on its core TV business.
The German TV group has been pursuing a standalone strategy, while investing in tech business, such as e-commerce operations and dating online platform ParshipMeet, whose planned IPO was frozen due to the current market environment and war in Ukraine.
""It is not easy for us to understand how to create long-term value in a conglomerate consisting of TV, e-commerce and dating portals,"" Giordani said.
TOP-LEVEL TALKS
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters Giordani will meet on Thursday with ProSieben management as part of a regular roadshow with investors, and will request clarification on synergies and advertising business performance. 
In December, ProSieben said it was extending CEO Rainer Beaujean's contract until 2027, and the supervisory board intended to propose Andreas Wiele, a former Axel Springer executive board member, as its new chairman. 
MFE was not given advance notice of such plan and it was not involved in the decision to propose former RTL boss Bert Habets and Rolf Nonnenmacher for the two seats that are to be reallocated at the annual general meeting in May.

Giordani said he would hope for a candidate that will be fully supported by MFE, which has not any representatives at the supervisory board, suggesting a compromise is still possible. Otherwise MFE could present rival candidates. 
""In any case, these would not be MFE representatives but independent managers with the right qualification,"" the executive said.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 10:30AM ET</span>","Boeing, suppliers' shares fall after 737 plane crashes in Southern China","(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and its suppliers fell on Monday as a 737-800 aircraft of China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA), with 132 people on board, crashed in the mountains of southern China.
The plane crashed after a sudden descent from cruising altitude. Media reported that rescue workers had found no sign of survivors. The cause of the crash was not yet known. Boeing said it was working to gather more information.
FlightRadar 24 said the jet involved in the accident is six years old. Following the crash, Chinese state media said the airline has grounded its 737-800 fleet, which according to the flight tracking website had 109 such planes. 
The popular variant is a predecessor to the Boeing's 737 MAX, which awaits regulatory approval in China, the world's largest domestic aviation market.
The 737-800 has a maximum seating capacity of 189 and is equipped with a CFM-56 engine, according to Boeing's website. 
It was not clear immediately if the aircraft involved in the accident had the same engine as airlines are free to choose engines from other suppliers.
The CFM engines are made by a joint venture between  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) SA. GE shares were down about 1%, while France-listed Safran fell 3%.
The planemaker's shares fell 4.5% in early trading, while the Chinese airline's U.S. listed ADRs were down about 9%.
Parts suppliers Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) Holdings Inc, Hexcel (NYSE:HXL) Corp and Triumph Group (NYSE:TGI) Inc were down between 1% and 4%.

CFRA Research analyst Colin Scarola said the crash should not technically impact the MAX's recertification in China where it has been grounded for three years following the two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.
But he did not rule out the country using the accident as an excuse to delay an approval. ""China likely would not admit this is what they are doing. But we certainly think it could happen,"" Scarola said.

Testa replaces Emmanuel Gintzburger who will become CEO of Italian fashion house Versace. 
Testa will be tasked with ""accelerating expansion of the British luxury house to tap its full potential,"" Kering said in a statement.
A luxury goods veteran who has worked for labels belonging to bigger rival LVMH, including TAG Heuer and Fendi, Testa joined Kering in 2016, where he was most recently president of Gucci in Europe and the Middle East as well as vice president of global retail. 

Kering, which relies on Gucci for the majority of its earnings, has been riding a wave of booming luxury demand.

529,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 10:16AM ET</span>",Explainer-Russia faces a raft of external debt payments,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russia is due to make another dollar-denominated payment to bondholders on Monday after last week defying fears it might not be able or willing to do so, following Western countries' unprecedented sanctions over Moscow's actions in Ukraine.
Paying external holders last week means Russia swerved its first default, for now, since a 1998 financial crisis and its first on international bonds since the 1917 revolution, when the Bolsheviks repudiated obligations of the Tsarist government. 
But with Russia due to repay another $66 million on Monday and a total of $4.7 billion between now and year end, there are further tests to come. 
WHAT HAS HAPPENED?
Russia has 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion. Prior to the Ukraine crisis roughly $20 billion was held by investment funds and money managers outside Russia. 
Last week's drama centred on two bonds the government issued in 2013, for which coupon, or interest, payments with a combined value of just over $117 million were due on Wednesday.
Like many international bonds there was a 30-day grace period, meaning Moscow effectively had until April 15 to pay.
Initially, Russia seemed to balk at the prospect of sending scarce hard currency overseas, but on March 14 the finance ministry said https://minfin.gov.ru/ru/press-center/?id_4=37805-utverzhden_vremennyi_poryadok_ispolneniya_gosudarstvennykh_dolgovykh_obyazatelstv_rossiiskoi_federatsii_v_inostrannoi_valyute it had approved a temporary procedure to make the payments. 
Under a temporary license issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), Russia's correspondent bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), was able to process the cash before crediting it to another U.S. bank,  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), the paying agent.
Citi checked the details and distributed it to bondholders, who market sources said on Thursday and Friday had received the money.
THE NEXT TEST
Further tests come thick and fast. On Monday, Russia is due to make a $66 million payment although technically, under the terms of the issue it could make this payment - as well as a $102 million one on March 28 - in alternatives currencies, including roubles. 
Gramercy, an emerging markets fund manager, noted on Friday that making use of the bond's ""alternative payment currency event"" required a 15-day notice, which it said Russia's finance ministry had not published.
After last week's payment showed Russia had the ability and willingness to pay in dollars,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said there was no reason for Russia to be able to invoke the alternative rouble payment clause, but that ""doesn't guarantee that Russia won't try"".
On March 31 there is a $447 million payment that must be made in dollars, while its biggest payment of the year -- and its first full repayment of ""principal"", of $2 billion -- is due on April 4.
Foreign investors also owned about $38 billion-worth of rouble-denominated sovereign bonds known as OFZs before this crisis, JPMorgan estimates -- nearly 20% of that market. Some of the payments due on those have not yet been made.
CAN RUSSIA KEEP PAYING?
Even if Russia remains willing to pay, there may be complications, especially for bonds that must be serviced in dollars.
Western sanctions ban transactions with Russia's finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund, although the temporary general license 9A https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/russia_gl9a.pdf issued by OFAC on March 2 makes an exception for the purposes of ""the receipt of interest, dividend, or maturity payments in connection with debt or equity"".
That license expires on May 25, however, after which Russia will still have almost $2 billion worth of external sovereign bond payments to make before the end of the year.
Morgan Stanley analysts say that after Monday's test, the next crucial date is May 27, when the first payments come due after the licence has expired.
That could force Russia into making payments for a dollar 2026 bond and a euro 2036 bond in roubles to onshore accounts, which the finance ministry has said would be its fallback option.
That would trigger a default on the dollar bond, as only the euro bond allows for payment in roubles. 
Morgan Stanley analysts say that the GL9A licence could be extended, ""yet for this to happen it would need a significant move towards de-escalation"".
Some analysts suggest money frozen abroad under the sanctions may have been used for last week's payments, although Russia has generally paid debt out of budget funds in the past.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF IT DOESN'T PAY?
If Russia fails to make any of its bond payments within their defined grace periods, or pays in roubles where dollars or euros are specified, it will be a historic default.
Such an event would have been unthinkable before the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a ""special military operation"", and subsequent Western sanctions.
Russia has nearly $650 billion of central bank reserves, one of the lowest debt-to-GDP levels in the world and has been raking in money from soaring oil and gas prices.

A default would lock it out of the international borrowing markets until the sanctions were lifted and it repaid creditors for any losses they had suffered.
It would also depress its credit ratings for some time, pushing up the interest rates the government and big Russian companies can borrow at.

Airlines, which are reeling from soaring fuel prices and airspace closures due to the war in Ukraine, had to cancel hundreds of flights to and from German airports amid security worker strikes last Monday and Tuesday.
Verdi called the strike for this Tuesday at Frankfurt, Berlin, Bremen, Hamburg, Hanover, Stuttgart, Duesseldorf and Cologne/Bonn airports.
Frankfurt is Germany's busiest airport, handling around 2.1 million passengers last month.
""We did make progress in aligning regional wages,"" Verdi negotiator Wolfgang Pieper said in a statement on Monday. 
""But when it came to wage increases, the employers' offers fell far short of what the employees demanded."" 
The union is demanding that employers raise the wages of the around 25,000 airport security employees in Germany by at least 1 euro an hour for the next 12 months and that staff in different parts of the country earn the same.

BDLS, the association of aviation safety companies, has said that all of Verdi's demands combined amounted to pay increases of up to 40% and were ""utopian.""
A next round of wage talks has been scheduled for Thursday, Verdi said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has decided to replace  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT) unit State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) as manager of the HK$111 billion ($14.2 billion) Tracker Fund of Hong Kong (TraHK), two sources told Reuters.
The decision on managing the fund, which tracks the benchmark Hang Seng index and is Hong Kong's top exchange traded fund (ETF), is expected to be announced in the coming weeks, said the sources with direct knowledge of the matter.
HKMA and SSGA declined to comment on any change in the TraHK mandate, which was first reported by media outlet Caixin.
The HKMA's move follows a review by the de-facto central bank and comes a year after a U-turn by SSGA, over an investment decision linked to U.S. sanctions on Chinese firms.
SSGA said in January 2021 that it would stop buying shares in China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and China Unicom (NYSE:CHU), two large constituents of the Hang Seng index, citing a decision to no longer invest in securities of U.S. sanctioned entities.
But three days later SSGA said it would resume investing in stocks denied to U.S. investors under an executive order by then U.S. President Donald Trump.
The initial TraHK decision to stop investing in the banned securities sparked anger from some investors, who called for SSGA to be replaced by a manager that could buy the stocks.
TraHK, which is popular among Hong Kong retail investors and pension funds, was set up in 1998 by Hong Kong's government to offload shares it had bought during the Asian financial crisis.
Two local asset managers have emerged as possible contenders to replace SSGA, including Hang Seng Investment Managers, an investment arm of Hang Seng Bank, which is a unit of HSBC, said the sources, who requested anonymity.
CSOP Asset Management, a joint venture between one of China's largest fund house China Southern and Hong Kong hedge fund OP investment, is the other candidate up for the top ETF job in Hong Kong, the sources said. 

Hang Seng Investment Managers and CSOP Asset Management also declined to comment.
SSGA has been paid a 0.05% annual management fee from TraHK since its listing in 1999, which was about HK$60 million income in 2020 and 2019 combined, the fund's annual report shows.

Investing.com -- Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKb) is to acquire Alleghany Corporation (NYSE:Y) in a deal worth approximately $11.6 billion. 
Berkshire will pay $848.02 per share in cash for the owner of reinsurer TransRe. The price represents a 29% premium to Alleghany’s average stock price over the last 30 days and a 16% premium to Alleghany’s 52-week high closing price.
The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter, with Alleghany continuing to operate as an independent subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) after the completion.
""Berkshire will be the perfect permanent home for Alleghany, a company that I have closely observed for 60 years. Throughout 85 years the Kirby family has created a business that has many similarities to Berkshire Hathaway. I am particularly delighted that I will once again work together with my long-time friend, Joe Brandon,"" said Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway’s Chairman and CEO. 
The acquisition news resulted in Alleghany shares jumping over 25% at the open.
Alleghany has a 25-day ""go shop"" period where it may actively solicit and consider other acquisition proposals. However, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Meyer Shields said in a research note that the company's relative complexity makes other bids unlikely."

The analyst has reflected on the MRNA stock ahead of phase 2 H2H study readout for Modernas seasonal flu program, mRNA- 1010, likely due in the next few weeks.
While the lackluster tolerability profile was a headwind, the phase 2 H2H trial is testing lower doses, which could improve adverse events, but it will be a delicate balance of efficacy vs. tolerability. However, even with lower doses, our experts agree that mRNA-1010 is likely to show non-inferiority to the active comparator, our base case being HAI GM titers 9-11x higher for H1N1 and 7-9x higher for H3N2 vs. baseline. That said, other attributes (manufacturing speed) could support mRNA-1010 being superior, Meachem said in a client note.
The raised price target reflects an increase in the LoS for the flu program to 35% (from 25%) given BofAs updated outlook.
The analyst also noted that Modernas product is likely to be first to market, although  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) is catching up fast. Meachem sees Modernas advantage as less than a year due to the speed of development for mRNA vaccines.
Our experts noted that price could be a limitation for uptake, as traditional flu vaccines are cheap, so in order to see broad adoption, mRNA flu vaccines would have to be either priced in-line with traditional vaccines or show superior efficacy.
Brookline Capital Markets analyst Leah Rush Cann took note of Moderna submitting an amendment to EUA for an additional booster dose of mRNA-1273.
We believe that the benefit of second booster doses of mRNA-1273, regardless of the vaccine used for the primary series has been demonstrated post marketing, in the real world setting, to prolong immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. We believe the authorization for a second booster of mRNA-1273 could come at a crucial time in the pandemic management, when variants are continuing to emerge and immunity conferred from initial boosters is starting to wane in those who were among the earliest vaccinated. These individuals are generally also among those most at risk, being 65 and older or having underlying health or occupational risk putting them at higher risk of COVID-19 disease, the analyst wrote in a memo to clients.
Rush Cann projects that Moderna will sell and deliver, globally, an estimated 1.177 billion doses of mRNA-1273 in 2022, with 234 million sold in the US. The analyst estimates 2030 sales of $51.4 billion for Moderna.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly higher on Monday, shrugging off more hawkish talk from the Federal Reserve as well as rhetoric from Europe that seemed to point to a further intensification of the military and economic struggle there.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 22 points, or less than 0.1%, at 34,734 points. The broader-based S&P 500 was up 0.3%, however, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.  All three indices had had their best week in several months last week amid rising hopes for a quick end to the war in Ukraine.
The Dow underperformed in part due to its heavy weighting of Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock, which fell 5.9% after one of its 737-800 NG aircraft, operated by China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA), crashed during a domestic flight with the loss of 132 lives. 
The 737-800 NG has had an excellent safety record over the last two decades, which may allay concerns that the flaws of the 737 MAX have somehow reappeared in a different guise. 
Another stock heading lower was  Shopify Inc  (NYSE:SHOP), which fell 14% after a raft of broker downgrades on Friday followed its underwhelming quarterly results and guidance earlier in the week. Shopify stock, like many growth names that performed well in the early stages of the pandemic, has lost nearly two-thirds of its value since November, as the Federal Reserve and other central banks have belatedly moved to tighten monetary policy.
Earlier, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic had appeared to temper his previous hawkishness, with a nod to the economic uncertainty created by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has sent energy prices spiraling higher across the world. Bostic said in a speech that: ""The elevated levels of uncertainty are front forward in my mind and have tempered my confidence that an extremely aggressive rate path is appropriate today.”
Early outperformers included conglomerate Alleghany (NYSE:Y), after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) offered to buy it for $11.6 billion, a deal that will add to Berkshire's insurance portfolio, among other things. 
Merger and acquisition activity was also behind the 25% rise in  Anaplan  (NYSE:PLAN) stock. The software company had agreed to sell itself to private equity group Thoma Bravo for $10.7 billion.
Oil and gas stocks were also supported by a fresh rise in crude prices, after the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said the EU is looking at expanding its current sanctions package on Russia to include energy purchases. The bloc's leaders are due to meet on Thursday with U.S. President Joe Biden in an effort to find ways to increase the pressure on Russia, which has intensified and expanded its artillery attacks across Ukraine over the weekend, and which downplayed reports of progress in peace talks earlier Monday.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock was up 9.7%, while  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock was up 2.8% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock was up 1.2%.

SYDNEY/MILAN (Reuters) -Italian luxury yacht maker Ferretti Group launched a Hong Kong initial public offering on Monday that values the company at up to $1.2 billion, a term sheet seen by Reuters showed, going ahead despite volatility in global equity markets.
Ferretti, whose customers include British fashion designer Jimmy Choo and former football star David Beckham, is a market leader for yachts measuring at least 80 feet, with a price tag ranging from 4 million euros ($4.4 million) to more than 20 million.
Downplaying risks to the group from the Ukraine war and ensuing sanctions against Russian oligarchs, Ferretti has said it has no exposure to mega- and giga-yachts chiefly hit by the measures. Fully customised superyachts measuring more than 100 feet account for only 9% of group revenues.
Braving choppy markets after a failed IPO attempt in 2019, Ferretti plans to sell 83.58 million shares, or around 25% of its total equity capital, to raise up to $301 million, according to the term sheet.
That entails a valuation of $932 million-$1.2 billion, with shares to be priced at HK$21.82 to HK$28.24 each, the term sheet showed.
Ferretti expects the value of the global yacht market to grow on average 7% a year, reaching 27 billion euros in 2025, with demand strengthening particularly in the Asia Pacific region, thanks also to tax breaks in China, an investor presentation seen by Reuters showed.
Building on 2021 revenues of 900 million euros, Ferretti plans to use most of the IPO proceeds to grow its core manufacturing business, adding new models, and to boost side services such as after-sales assistance or yacht chartering.
Ferretti, whose brands include Riva, Pershing and Wally, is owned by Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group.
Piero Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), son of the eponymous luxury sports car company's founder Enzo Ferrari, owns 11% of the company and sits on the board.
Five Chinese cornerstone investors have subscribed for $129.5 million worth of stock in the issue.
The 54-year-old company runs six shipyards in Italy and competes with family-owned Sanlorenzo, which listed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-sanlorenzo-idUSKBN1YA0PP in Milan in 2019. 
Shares in Sanlorenzo, which has also downplayed the hit from the Ukraine crisis, touched a 17-month low this month, before regaining some ground.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index has see-sawed in the past week but remains down nearly 9% for the year.
The value of Hong Kong IPOs in the first quarter tumbled to $837.4 million from $11 billion at the same time in 2021, Refinitiv data showed. 

The final price of Ferretti's shares is due to be set on Friday and the stock will start trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on March 31.

Canadian department store chain Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Co is bidding for Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), a source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.
The company had previously rejected buyout offers from Sycamore and Starboard Value-backed Acacia Research, with each offering to pay between $64 and $65 per share, valuing the company at around $9 billion.
Kohl's, which is facing pressure from activist investors to sell itself, said the proposals received are non-binding and without committed financing.

On a LTM basis, we est iPhone shipments in China totaled 48M capturing ~14.6% share. While Apple's share gains are impressive, lockdowns in mid-March in China will likely be the focus of investors going forward. While initial checks indicate the lock down is manageable and should not be a material headwind for the March qtr, a wider and more prolonged lock down could be a modest headwind in the June qtr. That said, we are not changing our iPhone March (55M), June (45M), and FY22 (235M) forecast at this time given the mitigation efforts by Apple and its partners but are monitoring policy changes, Vogt said in a client note.
As a result, the analyst has left his March/June iPhone unit estimates unchanged amid solid China data. However, these market gains are offset by Russia and recent COVID lockdowns in Shenzhen.
Vogt estimates that Apple will sell 55 million iPhone units in the March quarter, lower than the 57 million consensus.
Goldman Sachs analyst Allen Chang said he remains selective on smartphone components under the modest market growth, preferring market share gainers or those with product mix upgrades/product line expansion.

542,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 08:55AM ET</span>",Telegram surpasses WhatsApp to become Russia's top messenger - Megafon,"(Reuters) - Telegram has overtaken WhatsApp to become Russia's most popular messaging tool, the mobile operator Megafon said on Monday, with Russians flocking to the service as Moscow restricts some digital services. 
WhatsApp owner Meta Platforms Inc is embroiled in a Russian court case, with prosecutors seeking to label it an ""extremist organisation"", and authorities have actively promoted Telegram as they have banned other foreign platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Russia's military operation in Ukraine has added fuel to a simmering dispute between foreign digital platforms and Moscow.
Megafon, one of Russia's four main telecoms operators, said its analysis of mobile internet traffic showed that Telegram's share had jumped to 63% in the first two weeks of March from 48% in the first two weeks of February.
WhatsApp's share dropped to 32% from 48%, Megafon said.
The average Telegram user consumed 101 MB of data a day, compared to 26 MB for WhatsApp. 
Founded by Russian Pavel Durov, Telegram has long been a popular news platform in Russia, with almost all major media, government entities and public figures operating content channels. 
""The popularity of the service has grown against the backdrop of restrictions on access to other messengers and social networks,"" Megafon said in a statement. ""The service started actively growing on Feb. 24.""

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. 
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

In addition, GM will invest $1.35 billion in Cruise instead of SoftBank.
GM now owns roughly 80% of Cruise, while SoftBank is no longer a shareholder. The transaction values Cruise at around $30 billion, lower compared to the last funding that valued the startup above $30 billion.
The remaining 20% is held by employees and other investors, which include T. Rowe Price, Honda, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
Here are 3 analysts discussing GM's decision to increase its stake in the autonomous vehicle (AV) business.
Wolfes Rod Lache (Outperform, $70): Until now, GM's options for retaining control and exclusivity of Cruise were somewhat limited. GM reset the table by buying out Softbank (OTC:SFTBY)'s stake, which will ultimately raise GM's stake in Cruise to >80%. We're also raising our GM target to $70 from $67.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s Dan Levy (Outperform, $75): While the valuation was a negative (implying a down round for Cruise), and some might cite concerns of reduced independence of Cruise, we nevertheless focus on two positives: 1. The deal further ties Cruise to GM, creating a stronger case for operational synergies; 2. The tendering program + removal of IPO/liquidity vesting condition can help in talent attraction/retention. As it relates to GM stock, while investors likely are discounting AV valuations, we nevertheless believe the stronger tie to Cruise can eventually be a key long-term value creator.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)'s Colin Langan (Overweight, $83): The low Cruise valuation partially reflects SoftBank's desire to sell assets to improve its credit profile. GM was the most logical buyer with enough funds to execute the transaction quickly. On the other hand, the transaction is another sign that a Cruise IPO is not imminent. More importantly, the low valuation will likely raise concerns that Cruise is not worth the $30B value implied by the prior funding round. Cruise's market value is likely mid the two numbers. The $30B is likely lower, as investor interest in growth has moderated. And SoftBank likely accepted some discount to liquidate its position quickly. While GM traded up slightly post announcement, we expect the stock may end up trading down slightly on the low Cruise price.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse shook up its board on Monday, including the departure of its influential vice chair Severin Schwan, as it attempts to draw a line under a series of damaging scandals.
Switzerland's second largest bank said that Schwan, 54, who was its lead independent director as well as chief executive of Roche, would not stand for re-election to the board of directors at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN)'s annual general meeting on April 29.
Schwan faced criticism for leading the Swiss pharmaceuticals firm while at the same time acting as vice chair of Credit Suisse, a demanding position as the bank grappled with several risk-management scandals which hit its share price.
Schwan was not immediately available for comment.
Another two of the 13 members of the Credit Suisse board, Kai S. Nargolwala and Juan Colombas, will also not stand for re-election, the bank said in a statement.
The Zurich-based bank said it had nominated Christian Gellerstad to succeed Schwan, who joined the board in 2014 and has been vice chair and lead independent director since 2017.
Schwan was also a member of the governance and nominations committee which picked Antonio Horta-Osorio as chairman. Horta-Osorio left in January less than nine months into the job after a probe into breaches of COVID-19 rules. 
Credit Suisse has been hit by scandals and losses, notably from the collapse of U.S. family office Archegos Capital Management and British financier Greensill Capital. 
Shares in the bank, which lost more than 22% of their value last year and a further 14.5% this year, were up 0.5% at 7.63 Swiss francs at 1158 GMT. 
Investor representative group Actares said it was pleased that Schwan was going in the wake of the chairman fiasco and the scandals which occurred during the time he was on the board.

The bank said it had nominated Mirko Bianchi, who served as chief financial officer at UniCredit, Keyu Jin, a professor of economics at the London School of Economics, and Amanda Norton, who most recently served at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) as group chief risk officer, for election as non-executive members.
Axel Lehmann, who took over as chairman after Horta-Osorio's abrupt departure, thanked the outgoing board members, saying Schwan and Nargolwala had ""helped steer the company through some challenging periods"".

BETA+, which includes Maxit and Digital Investor, provides back-office processing to the wealth management industry, including securities processing and tax reporting. It had revenue of about $300 million last year, mainly linked to U.S. markets.
LSEG said it expects to hand a ""significant proportion"" of the net proceeds to shareholders via a buyback, which would likely start in the third quarter.
""In addition, LSEG announces that it has entered into a new long-term strategic partnership for data, content and tools with BETA+ and portfolio companies owned by Motive and Clearlake,"" LSEG said in a statement.
The partnership will provide LSEG with new, recurring revenue at attractive growth rates through access to new client segments, the exchange said.
Shares in LSEG, which said leverage would be cut, were down 0.2% at 7,942 pence at 1200 GMT.

""The wealth management industry continues to demonstrate opportunities, bolstered by tailwinds across the spectrum including a significant movement in technology modernization, industry consolidation, increases in retail trading, and democratization of the capital markets,"" Clearlake and Motive said in a statement.

U.S.-listed shares of Pinduoduo fell as much as 12% in premarket trading before paring losses.
A comparatively new entrant in the Chinese e-commerce sector, Pinduoduo faces competition from larger rivals with strong infrastructure and logistics as well as dominant market positions.
A slowdown in Chinese economic growth and COVID-19 outbreaks have also taken a toll on consumers' discretionary spending.
Total revenue was 27.23 billion yuan ($4.29 billion) in the fourth quarter, below estimates of 30.10 billion yuan, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was 6.62 billion yuan in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of 1.38 billion yuan a year ago.
Gross merchandise value (GMV), a metric widely used at e-commerce companies to measure the total value of sales, reached 2,441 billion yuan last year for the Shanghai-headquartered firm, up 46% from 2020.
Pinduoduo's GMV is expected to rise at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% in the next 10 years, according to a report issued by Morningstar Equity Research this month, mainly driven by growth in sales of agricultural products.
""In 2021, we made the strategic shift from sales and marketing toward research and development,"" said chairman and chief executive Chen Lei in a statement. ""We see ourselves making more long-term investment, especially in agriculture and R&D.""
Chinese regulators have been conducting a campaign to rein in the country's massive and fast-developing online economy since the end of 2020, and share prices of listed Chinese tech giants have fallen sharply since then.

Pinduoduo had lost 27% of its market capitalisation since the beginning of this year by Friday, closing at $42.6, after losing 67% in 2021.

Chief Executive Officer Marco Margiotta said the higher cashback in partnership with fintech company Payfare will help drivers stay on the road and ""ease the pain of rising gas prices.""
Prices for gasoline have soared more than 20% from last month, according to the American Automobile Association, driven by higher crude oil rates due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The company said Lyft Direct cardholders can save up to 21 cents per gallon on average with the increased cashback.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft drivers have considered quitting the app-based ride-hailing platforms as fueling up becomes costlier.

Both the platforms over the past few months have been investing in keeping drivers and bringing in more to meet rising demand as COVID-19 cases ease and consumers venture out.
In response to record gas prices, the companies earlier this month announced a 55-cent per-ride surcharge that would be paid directly to drivers.

The deal, announced on Sunday, would give Anaplan investors $66 for each share held, a premium of more than 30% over the company's last closing price on Friday.
With pandemic-led lockdowns accelerating digital transformations across enterprises, demand for cloud has jumped. While most software companies saw their shares jump last year, Anaplan failed to capitalize on the boom and its shares tumbled over 36%.
Anaplan provides planning software as a service to businesses that help in modeling different forecasting outcomes, and has more than 1,900 customers worldwide. 
Hedge fund Sachem Head Capital Management took a nearly 5% stake in Anaplan last month to press the company to make changes.
Software-focused Thoma Bravo, which has with more than $103 billion in assets under management, will focus on Anaplan's software platform and branding to grow business. The deal is expected to close in the first half of this year.
The highly leveraged buyout is the latest in the software sector, which has attracted interest from private equity players.

(Reuters) -Wall Street is taking a gloomy view of  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) ahead of its quarterly results on Monday, as rising COVID-19 cases in China, the Russia-Ukraine crisis and lingering supply issues threaten to hit the sportswear giant's 2022 sales.
At least 10 brokerages have cut the stock's price targets this week on fears that a lift from strong sneaker demand in North America will be offset by persistent shortages, stemming from factory closures in top supplier Vietnam last year.
Nike's current quarter is also expected to take a hit from stalling shopping traffic in China due to rising COVID infections and the decision to temporarily shutter stores and online business in Russia, following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
""The recent rise in geopolitical uncertainty, increase in oil prices, and growing strength of the U.S. dollar present risk of slowing growth for Nike's international segments ahead,"" Jefferies analysts said.
THE CONTEXT
Earlier this month, Nike's main rival Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) Inc flagged a knock to sales from closing operations in Russia and COVID disruptions in Vietnam. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts cut their forecast for Nike's current-quarter revenue growth in Europe to 7% from 15%, largely due to an estimated 2% hit to total sales from the Russia exit.
Still, resilient demand despite higher prices and a pivot to selling more products directly to consumers are expected to ease the pressure of higher supply chain costs on Nike's margins. 
""There is still a lot of strength in the way that Nike is running its retail strategy, and in its product. Those two strategies are key for its future,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.
THE FUNDAMENTALS
* Analysts on average expect Nike to report third-quarter revenue of $10.59 billion, down from $10.63 billion at the start of this week. Third-quarter revenue last year was $10.36 billion * Full-year revenue expectations have taken an even bigger beating since Monday, slipping to $46.90 billion from $47.06 billion * Third-quarter revenue from China is projected to fall nearly 12% to $2.01 billion, after slumping 19.8% in the prior quarter * The company is expected to report third-quarter earnings per share of 71 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, compared with the 76 cents reported a year earlier * The Dow component has declined over 22% since the start of this year to Thursday's close, compared with the 5.1% fall in the index for the same period
WALL STREET SENTIMENT

* The current average analyst rating on NKE shares is ""buy"", with 29 rating it ""strong buy"" or ""buy"", seven rating it a ""hold"" and two rating it a ""sell"" or ""strong sell"". 
* The mean price target is $168.24, down from $181.35 at the start of March

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Volkswagen will form joint ventures with Huayou Cobalt and Tsingshan Group to secure nickel and cobalt supplies for electric vehicles in China, the world's No. 1 car market, and to slash costs at a time of surging raw material prices.
The move is part of a 30 billion euro ($33 billion) push by the world's second-largest carmaker to build a network of battery cell factories and secure more direct access to vital raw materials that are needed to supply them.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) , Huayou Cobalt and Tsingshan have signed a memorandum of understanding for a joint venture in Indonesia, where more than 10% of the world's laterite nickel ore reserves are located, to focus on nickel and cobalt raw material production.
At the final expansion stage of the venture, it will be able to supply raw materials for 160 gigawatt hours worth of electric vehicle batteries, Volkswagen China Group said in a statement.
This corresponds to an annual output of around 120,000 tonnes of nickel and 15,000 tonnes of cobalt, Huayou said in a separate filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
Volkswagen's second joint venture will be formed with Huayou in China's southwestern Guangxi region for the refining of nickel and cobalt sulfates, precursor and cathode material production, it said.
""The cooperation aims to achieve significant cost advantages, secure the raw material supply and achieve a transparent and sustainable supply chain,"" it said. ""The two partnerships target to contribute to the Group's long term target of a 30-50% cost reduction on each battery.""
Global nickel prices have surged almost 400% this year due to the Ukraine crisis, as Russia is a major supplier and its invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of sanctions on Moscow by the West lit a fire under an already hot market.
Prices on the London Metal Exchange got a further boost on March 8 when they doubled to $100,000 per tonne in a matter of hours, after Tsingshan bought large amounts of nickel to reduce its short bets on the metal and its exposure to costly margin calls.
Prices have dropped sharply since then however, after the LME was forced to halt trading for a period and reopened with new trading limits. 
Privately owned Tsingshan has become the world's top nickel producer thanks to its development of a low-cost process to make the metal. It already has major investments in Indonesia, including other joint ventures with Huayou.
Volkswagen's move comes as rivals, from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to BYD, are raising prices for EVs due to higher raw material costs, and follows Ford's announcement last week spelling out plans for a nickel cell joint venture in Turkey. 
On Saturday, the chief executive of Chinese EV manufacturer Li Auto, Li Xiang, said on his official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account that battery makers had increased prices at a rate he called ""outrageous"" in the second quarter, and warned that those EV makers that had not raised prices yet would likely have to soon.

Asked to comment on Li's remarks, Chinese battery maker CATL, which supplies major car makers including Tesla, told Reuters on Monday that it had raised prices for some battery products due to rising raw material costs.

Novatek, Russia's largest private natural gas producer, did not provide a reason for his resignation. A representave of Timchenko, who had served on the company's board of directors since 2009, declined to comment.
The European Union and Britain last month imposed sanctions on Timchenko and other billionaires with ties to Putin. 
Timchenko, already on a U.S. sanctions list over Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea, was Russia's sixth-richest billionaire last year with a net worth of $22 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it said were dangerous nationalists. 
Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces. 

Timchenko, who sits on the board of petrochemicals producer Sibur, was co-founder of Switzerland-based oil trader Gunvor. Timchenko sold his stake in Gunvor in 2014 after the United States imposed sanctions against him.
Timchenko has said he owned a few trading companies in and near St Petersburg in the 1990s, when Putin worked in the office of the city's mayor.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in a mixed fashion Monday, with the FTSE 100 outperforming on the back of its heavily-weighted resource companies as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine resulted in crude price gains.
By 4:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the CAC 40 in France traded flat, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.4%.
The conflict triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 is entering its fifth week. Diplomacy efforts are ongoing, with Turkey's foreign minister stating on Sunday that the two sides were nearing agreement on ""critical"" issues, but the fighting continues, particularly around the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
German producer prices increased 25.9% year on year in February, data showed Monday, the largest rise since 1949, mainly because of energy prices.
Oil prices jumped further Monday following a weekend attack on the  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) refinery joint venture in Yanbu, as well as concerns the EU will join the United States in imposing an oil embargo on Russia. 
U.S. President Joe Biden is set to arrive in Brussels on Thursday for summits with the members of NATO, as well as the European Union governments to discuss their response to Russia’s aggression. 
The West has already imposed a number of punishing sanctions on Moscow for its invasion, including a freezing of the assets of the Russian central bank. These moves have yet to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the fighting, and the obvious next move is for the bloc to target Russian oil.
This would be an economically tough choice, as the EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas, with Germany the most dependent of the bloc's large economies.
By 4:55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.5% higher at $107.73 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 4.2% to $112.50.
Looking at the corporate sector, the rising crude prices have buoyed the energy sector, with BP (NYSE:BP) stock up 2.2%, Eni (MI:ENI) stock up 2.2%, and TotalEnergies (PA:TTEF) stock up 1.3%.
Elsewhere, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock rose 1.3% after the German car manufacturer’s Chinese unit said on Monday it will form joint ventures with Huayou Cobalt and Tsingshan Group, in a bid to control battery costs at a time of surging raw material prices.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) stock rose 1.8% after the French car maker announced Monday it has resumed production at its Moscow plant.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.2% to $1,926.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.1057.

Shipments were down from about 21.3 million handsets in February 2021 and 32.4 million in January 2022, according to the CAICT, a state-backed think-tank.
Handset brands are currently experiencing production issues due to a global computer chip shortage.
A combination of factors including demand miscalculation, unexpected factory shutdowns and U.S.-China tensions have prompted a number of automobile companies to report chip sourcing issues.

That shortage has since spread to many types of chips and all kinds of hardware, including smartphones.
Delayed upgrades from consumers have also caused sales to slow in China.

563,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2022 03:07AM ET</span>",Australia to make Big Tech hand over misinformation data,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's media regulator will be able to force internet companies to share data about how they have handled misinformation and disinformation under new laws that will bolster government efforts to rein in Big Tech.
The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) will also be able to enforce an internet industry code on uncooperative platforms, the government said on Monday, joining others around the world seeking to reduce the spread of harmful falsehoods online.
The planned laws are a response to an ACMA investigation that found four-fifths of Australian adults had experienced misinformation about COVID-19 and 76% thought online platforms should do more to cut the amount of false and misleading content online.
The laws broadly align with efforts by Europe to curb damaging online content, which are due to take effect by the end of 2022, although the European Union has said it wants even tougher measures to stop disinformation given some of the output from Russian state-owned media during the invasion of Ukraine.
""Digital platforms must take responsibility for what is on their sites and take action when harmful or misleading content appears,"" Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said in a statement.
Australians were most likely to see misinformation on larger services like Meta Platforms's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR), the ACMA said. 
False narratives typically started with ""highly emotive and engaging posts within small online conspiracy groups"" and were ""amplified by international influencers, local public figures, and by coverage in the media"", it added.
The authority also noted that disinformation, which involves intentionally spreading false information to influence politics or sow discord, was continuing to target Australians. Facebook had removed four disinformation campaigns in Australia from 2019 to 2020, it said.
It said conspiracy groups often urged people to join smaller platforms with looser moderation policies, like Telegram. If those platforms rejected industry-set content guidelines ""they may present a higher risk to the Australian community"", the ACMA said.
The crackdown adds another element to the ruling conservative government's assertion that it has taken a big stick approach to tech giants, as it faces an election that is due by May that most polls suggest it will lose.
Fletcher said the new powers for the regulator would be introduced to parliament in late 2022, meaning it would likely be up to the current opposition Labor party to shepherd them through if the government loses the election.

A spokesperson for Labor's shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, told Reuters the opposition supported the expanded powers but the government had taken too long to introduce them since they were recommended in 2019.
DIGI, an Australian industry body representing Facebook, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, Twitter and video site TikTok, said it supported the recommendations and noted it had already set up a system to process complaints about misinformation.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open lower Monday, with sentiment dented by higher oil prices and as the conflict in Ukraine rages on.
At 3:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.8% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.8% and the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. fell 0.6%.

By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3.3% higher at $106.50 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 3% to $111.11.
Oil prices recorded a second consecutive weekly decline last week, but hit the highest levels in 14 years two weeks ago, boosted by the supply crunch from traders avoiding Russian barrels and dwindling oil stockpiles. 
In economic news, German producer prices rose again in February, climbing 1.4% on the month and a massive 25.9% on the year, putting inflation firmly to the fore of investors' thinking ahead of a speech by ECB President Christine Lagarde later Monday.

Evergrande, the world's most indebted developer with over $300 billion in liabilities, has been struggling to repay its suppliers and creditors and complete projects and homes.

Until recent weeks relatively unscathed by coronavirus, Shanghai reported 24 new domestically transmitted COVID cases with confirmed symptoms for Sunday and 734 local asymptomatic infections, official data showed on Monday.
It is the fourth consecutive day that Shanghai's local asymptomatic infections have increased. 
Although the tally of infections is tiny by global standards, Shanghai has quickly followed China's ""dynamic clearance"" policies, shutting schools and testing residential compounds in the effort to limit the spread of the virus.
""When it comes to the entire situation of epidemic control and prevention that we are facing, it is very complex and serious, and it is also a very big test for us,"" city health official Wu Jinglei told a news briefing. 
Shanghai will stick with ""dynamic clearance"", Wu added, saying he hoped for continued public support for the policy.
The city also shut the Shanghai Disney Resort from Monday until further notice.
But there were signs of frustration with the city's ad hoc, district-by-district approach.
""Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen have had three different epidemic response models,"" said a user of China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) network.
""Hong Kong is the worst but will be the first to open up,"" the writer, going by the name zangyn, said in a widely shared post. ""Shenzhen is the most effective, and Shanghai may be the most tiring, and even the most miserable.""
The severity of outbreak responses by Shanghai's compounds and residential districts varied, with some opting for lockdowns as long as two weeks. Some people in other sealed-off districts said they were not told how long they would have to stay home. 
Residents' committees helping to organise testing programmes also encountered challenges. One compound distributed tokens to foil outsiders' attempts to take free tests. 
Including Shanghai infections, mainland China reported a total of 1,947 new locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms on Sunday, data from the National Health Commission (NHC) showed, up from 1,656 a day earlier.
The top steelmaking city of Tangshan, with just 12 local infections since March. 19, is allowing only essential vehicles on roads smaller than expressways, while people with special needs who must use vehicles have to seek approval.
The southern manufacturing hub of Shenzhen has allowed work and production activities, as well as bus and subway services in most areas, to resume after daily local case numbers dropped following three rounds of city-wide testing. 
Tight curbs remain in some places, however. 
Shenzhen residents still need to show negative tests in order to use public transport from Monday until March 27, a period in which non-essential indoor services will stay closed, the city government has said. 
Vaccine candidates to target Omicron specifically, or among variants of concern, are in studies prior to clinical trials, a national health official said on Saturday, without identifying the companies involved.

China's new local asymptomatic cases, which it does not classify as confirmed cases, was 2,384, up from 2,177 a day earlier. The death toll was unchanged at 4,638, with no new deaths.
By Sunday, mainland China had reported 132,226 cases with confirmed symptoms, both among locals and arrivals from outside.

China’s Shanghai Composite was up 0.31% by 10:53 PM ET (2:53 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component rose 0.96%. The People’s Bank of China stuck to expectations, keeping the one-year loan prime rate at 3.70% and the five-year LPR at 4.60%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index inched down 0.05%.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 0.27%. In Australia, the ASX 200 edged down 0.15%, with the country banning alumina exports to Russia.
Japanese markets are closed for a holiday.
In the U.S., S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts retreated. This, alongside the moves in Asia Pacific, indicated that global equities were taking a breather from their best weekly performance in about 16 months.
The question for this week is whether they will maintain the rebound and slight dip in volatility from the previous week. China’s vow to support its markets and economy is also providing a small boost.
The conflict triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 is entering its fifth week. Although Turkey said Russia and Ukraine are moving closer towards talks for a cease-fire, Russia issued an ultimatum for the surrender of the Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
It also continued to have an impact on the bond market, alongside the U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent monetary policy tightening. The Treasury yield curve is flattening, with portions inverted, a potential warning of an economic slowdown. There is no cash trading in Asia due to the Japanese holiday.
While markets are deriving hope from the peace talks, “the truth is a bit more complex because, unfortunately, we have major devastation going on,” Mizuho Bank Ltd. head of economics and strategy Vishnu Varathan told Bloomberg. “Uncertainty remains elevated,” he added.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will speak later in the day, alongside Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic. This comes less than a week after the Fed raised interest rates as it handed down its latest policy decision.
However, “our concern is that the Fed is tightening into an economic slowdown as it prioritizes high inflation,” Manulife Investment Management head of macro strategy for Asia Sue Trinh told Bloomberg.
“We think it will balance that trade-off of slower growth, higher inflation by lagging the market pricing in terms of the pace, the magnitude, and the duration of this tightening cycle,” she added.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will speak at the BIS Innovation Summit 2022 on Tuesday, with Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and Powell following a day later.

Mapletree Commercial Trust (MCT) had announced plans in December to buy Mapletree North Asia Commercial Trust (MNACT), seeking to create the seventh largest real estate investment trust (REIT) in Asia with an expected market value of about S$10.5 billion.
The two REITs said in a joint statement on Monday that MNACT unitholders would now have the option to choose consideration in cash, in addition to the prior offer for MCT units or a combination of both cash and MCT units.
The value of the merger remained unchanged at S$1.1949 per MNACT unit, they said. However, the inclusion of the cash option will result in an additional cash requirement of up to S$2.2 billion, which will be funded through a preferential offering to MCT unitholders at an issue price of S$2.0039 per MCT Unit.
Last month, Reuters had reported that activist investor Quarz Capital Management was opposed to the terms of the proposed merger, saying MNACT was significantly undervalued.

Mapletree Investments Pte Ltd, the global real estate conglomerate owned by Singapore state investor Temasek, is the single largest unitholder in both the trusts, owning 32.6% of MCT and 38.1% of MNACT, as of Dec. 29.

(Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged a former Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) employee with defrauding the iPhone maker out of more than $10 million in a series of schemes.
Dhirendra Prasad faces five criminal counts after exploiting his ""position of trust"" as a buyer in Apple's global service supply chain to defraud the company, according to filings on Friday with the federal court in San Jose, California.
Prosecutors said that as an Apple buyer, Prasad negotiated with vendors and placed orders, with Apple making payments based on invoice amounts he entered into its purchasing system.
Prasad allegedly defrauded Apple by taking kickbacks, stealing parts using false repair orders, and causing Apple to pay for items and services it never received
Prosecutors said Prasad also evaded taxes on and laundered proceeds from his schemes. Apple fired him in December 2018 after a decade of employment, court papers show.
It is unclear whether Prasad has a lawyer. Prasad could not immediately be reached on Sunday for comment. A phone number listed for him has been disconnected.
Two owners of vendors that did business with Apple and who allegedly conspired with Prasad on similar fraud schemes pleaded guilty to related charges in December, court records show.

Prasad faces charges including conspiring to commit wire and mail fraud, commit money laundering and defraud the United States, as well as tax evasion.
His arraignment is scheduled for March 24. Prosecutors also want Prasad to forfeit millions of dollars of real property and other assets.

The French government said in the days after the accident that Tesla had told it that there was no immediate indication of a technical fault.
Sarah Saldmann said her client had on Friday filed a criminal complaint with public prosecutors in Versailles alleging that Tesla had ""put the lives of others in danger"".
Tesla did not respond to an emailed request for comment. 
The off-duty taxi driver's Tesla ploughed through metal posts, a row of pay-to-ride bicycles and a recycling bin full of glass, hitting pedestrians and a van before finally coming to a halt, witnesses said of the accident.
The taxi driver, who has not been named, told police after the accident that the car had accelerated on its own and that he was unable to activate the brakes.
Saldmann declined to comment when asked if the complaint had been made on the basis of the still-unpublished initial conclusions from investigators. 
In addition to the fatality, three people were seriously hurt and another 17 injured in the accident in the 13th arrondissement of the French capital on a street lined with bars, restaurants and shops.
The taxi driver is under formal investigation for manslaughter but has not been charged. He tested negative in an alcohol test after the accident.

The public prosecutor's office in Versailles will now decide whether Tesla has a case to answer.
Tesla collects detailed data from the sensors and cameras on its vehicles and has used such data in the past to challenge claims that accidents were caused by malfunctioning technology.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's state oil company Aramco (SE:2222), under pressure from the West to boost output amid soaring prices, pledged on Sunday to hike investments by around 50% this year as it reported a doubling in 2021 profits.
Oil prices leapt 50% last year as demand recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic, and then surged above $100 a barrel to 14 year highs in February after Russia invaded Ukraine, leading Western nations to urge major producers to increase output. 
Aramco said it would boost its capital expenditure (capex) to $40-50 billion this year, with further growth expected until around the middle of the decade. Capex was $31.9 billion last year, up 18% from 2020 - indicating an increase of about 50% for this year at the middle of the guidance range. 
Asked if Aramco would pump more oil to fill any gaps in the market left by the war in Ukraine, CEO Amin Nasser said it would produce according to guidelines from the Saudi energy ministry.
The company has said it plans to raise its crude oil ""maximum sustainable capacity"" to 13 million barrels a day by 2027, and wants to increase gas production by more than 50% by 2030. Its average hydrocarbon production was 12.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day last year.
Aramco made $110 billion in net profit in 2021, up from $49 billion a year earlier and compared with analysts' mean estimate of $106 billion, according to Refinitiv Eikon.
With a rise in both output and prices, analysts expect net profit to reach $140 billion in 2022.
Aramco's shares rose over 4% in early trade to a high of 43.85 riyals, valuing it at 8.76 trillion riyals ($2.34 trillion).
A $2 trillion valuation was a goal sought by de-facto Saudi leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before the company's record $29.4 billion initial public offering in 2019. 
He has announced plans to sell more Aramco shares. 
The surge in Aramco's valuation on Sunday moved it above that of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), though it remains behind Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s $2.68 trillion.
The Saudi government said last month that Crown Prince Mohammed, who is leading a huge investment drive to diversify the kingdom's economy, had transferred 4% of Aramco shares to the country's sovereign wealth fund.
BOOSTING CAPEX 
""They are ramping up the reinvestment quite substantially and they are likely to use (the free cash flow) to de-lever the balance sheet,"" said Yousef Husseini, head of the materials team at EFG Hermes Research.
Aramco said its free cash flow was $107.5 billion last year, compared with $49.1 billion in 2020. It declared a dividend of $75 billion for 2021, in line with its earlier pledge. 
The company said it also planned to develop a significant hydrogen export capability and become a global leader in carbon capture and storage technology.
Nasser told an earnings call that global oil demand was growing healthily and spare production capacity was declining.

In a separate statement he said ""although economic conditions have improved considerably, the outlook remains uncertain due to various macro-economic and geopolitical factors.""

The Western Cape division of the High Court interdicted the project developer from continuing with works at the Cape Town site until there had been meaningful engagement and consultation with affected indigenous peoples.
""This matter ultimately concerns the rights of indigenous peoples .... The fundamental right to culture and heritage of indigenous groups, more particularly the Khoi and San First Nations Peoples, are under threat in the absence of proper consultation,"" Judge Patricia Goliath said in her ruling. 
The Khoi and the San were the earliest inhabitants of South Africa, the latter roaming as hunter gatherers for tens of thousands of years, and the former joining them as pastoralists more than 2,000 years ago.
Some of their descendants had objected to the River Club development, where Amazon would be the ""anchor tenant"" but which also includes plans for a hotel, retail offices and homes, as it lies at the confluence of two rivers considered sacred, the Black and Liesbeek Rivers.
Not everyone identifying with the Khoi and San was against the project. An association of Khoi and San who supported it was among the respondents in the case.
Amazon was not named as a respondent, and the company did not respond to an emailed request for comment sent outside office hours. When the court case was launched early this year a spokesperson declined comment.
Goliath said her ruling should not be construed as a criticism of the development but that the core issue was that there needed to be proper consultation before it could go ahead.

Amazon already employs thousands of people in data hubs in Cape Town, and with over a third of South Africans unemployed authorities are keen to encourage foreign investment.
Construction of the River Club development had continued despite the case being before the court.

(Reuters) -  Canadian Pacific  Railway (NYSE:CP) halted operations and locked out workers over a labor dispute early on Sunday, with each side blaming the other for a halt that will likely disrupt shipment of key commodities at a time of soaring prices.
""We are very disappointed with this turn of events,"" said Teamsters Canada Rail Conference spokesperson Dave Fulton. The union said in a statement that it had begun to strike across the country in the dispute that it says affects 3,000 engineers, conductors and yard workers.
Canada's second-biggest railroad operator accused the union of misrepresenting the company's position, saying in a statement that the Teamsters were ""well aware of the damage this reckless action will cause to the Canadian supply chain."" 
Minister of Labour Seamus O'Regan Jr said CP and Teamsters were still at the table with federal mediators.
""We are monitoring the situation closely and expect the parties to keep working until they reach an agreement,"" he said in a tweet just after midnight.
Canada, the largest country by area after Russia, depends heavily on rail to move commodities and manufactured goods to port. CP's network runs across much of southern Canada and extends as far south as Kansas City in the United States. 
The lockout is the latest blow to Canada's battered supply chain, which last year weathered floods in British Columbia that washed out track and suspended access to Canada's biggest port. CP has said a stoppage would disrupt the movement of grain, potash and coal.
CP had notified the union on Wednesday that it would lock out employees on Sunday, barring a breakthrough in talks on a deal covering pensions, pay and benefits.
It said the key bargaining issue is the union's request for higher pension caps. Chief Financial Officer Nadeem Velani told a New York investor conference on Tuesday that the railway was unwilling to accept that demand.

Canada's  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) said this week it may need to reduce potash production at its mines in the province of Saskatchewan if the shutdown lasts longer than a few days.
The country's last major railway labor disruption was an eight-day Canadian National Railway (TSX:CNR) Co strike in 2019. But in the past 12 years, there have been 12 stoppages due to poor weather, blockades or labor issues, according to the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association.

By Richa Naidu and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Western companies that maintain a presence in Russia to provide essential goods such as food and medicines are trying to strike a balance between President Vladimir Putin's government and advocates of Ukraine pulling them in opposite directions. 
More than 400 companies have withdrawn from Russia since the launch of its attack on Ukraine on Feb. 24, according to a list compiled by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management. They have left behind assets that were worth hundreds of billions of dollars in aggregate before the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special military operation.""
Yet about 80 companies have retained a presence, even as they suspended new investments and business ventures. Many are consumer and pharmaceutical companies that argue that pulling out would significantly harm the Russian population. Some are also concerned about legal repercussions for their employees in the country should the Russian government retaliate. 
""Companies believe they can't easily abandon small Russian businesses and consumers that rely on them,"" said Bruce Haynes, global co-chair of crisis communications at public relations firm SVC+FGH who has been advising companies on their withdrawal from Russia.
Consumer goods giants such PepsiCo Inc, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co and Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) have said they will retain a presence in Russia to provide basic items for nutrition and hygiene, such as milk and diapers.
With casualties and refugees from the conflict in Ukraine mounting, pressure is building to pull out of Russia completely.
""Barring a turnaround we don't see right now, the pressure (to pull out) is going to grow,"" said BSR Chief Executive Aron Cramer, who advises companies on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) issues.
Katie Denis, communications and research lead at the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group that counts  Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and P&G among its members, said its members by-and-large did not support Russia's actions in Ukraine, but that uninvolved Russian people should not be made to suffer for it.
Pharmaceutical companies such as  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Germany's  Bayer AG  (DE:BAYGN) and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) have said they will halt non-essential operations in Russia but plan to continue supplying medications for diseases such as diabetes and cancer. They have noted that prescription medicines have been excluded from international sanctions because they serve an essential humanitarian need. However, in recent days, even those goods have come under scrutiny.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy this week urged pharmaceutical companies to join conglomerates withdrawing from Russia completely. Sonnenfeld, whose list has been seized on by human rights activists to pressure global companies to leave Russia, has also called for such a move.
Some drug companies have backing from their shareholders. Josh Brockwell, for example, an executive at investment firm Azzad Asset Management, said he supported Pfizer's decision to keep supplying Russia. ""I don't think the people should suffer for the actions of the (Russian) government,"" he said.
Many U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies say they do not make drugs in Russia, but some European peers, including Switzerland's Novartis SA, maintain manufacturing plants in the country.
CARVING OUT RUSSIA PROFITS
Putin said last week Russia could seize assets of companies that abandon their operations in the country. Russian prosecutors have also warned some Western companies that their employees could face arrests if they shut down production of essential goods, a person familiar with the matter said.
British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Chief Marketing Officer Kingsley Wheaton told Reuters last week that exiting its business or stopping the sale or manufacturing of its products would be regarded as a criminal bankruptcy by Russia that could expose its staff in the country to prosecution. 
Other challenges consumer companies still operating in Russia face are processing transactions under banking sanctions and securing raw materials, said Jack Martin, a fund manager at Oberon Investments, which has stakes in Unilever (NYSE:UL),  Diageo  (LON:DGE), Burberry, GSK, Eli Lilly and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE).
""The risk premium around investing in companies that do business in Russia has increased,"" Martin said.
Companies are trying to come up with ways to appease all sides. Pfizer and Eli Lilly, for example, said they would set aside for humanitarian relief any profits from sales in Russia. Novartis and Bayer have each pledged millions of dollars for Ukraine relief. 
Some companies are staying in Russia while seeking parties to buy or take over their local operations. British America Tobacco's Wheaton said his company was trying to do this ""rapidly."" Interested parties could include its Russian distributor of 30 years, Wheaton said.
Many companies are also concerned about what would happen to their facilities in their absence. An abandoned food plant, for example, could be repurposed by Russia to supply troops fighting in Ukraine.
Some investors want companies to consider how they may be indirectly funding the war by paying taxes. Hannah Shoesmith, director of engagement at asset manager Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI), told Reuters last week companies need to ""think carefully"" about any taxes they are paying to the Russian government and if the products and services they are providing are worth that risk. 

Companies that left Russia may find it difficult to reclaim their property and assets once they are expropriated. Tiffany Compres, a partner with law firm FisherBroyles, said companies may sue Russia in international venues such as the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, but such cases can drag on for years and Russia cannot be forced to pay out.
""Even if the company wins the claim, Russia has a reputation for not paying,"" Compres said.

The fund voted against the Japanese industrial conglomerate's plan to break itself up by spinning off its devices business, a voting record showed.
It owns 1.22% of Toshiba, according to Refinitiv.
Similarly, the State Board of Administration of Florida, with a 0.22% stake in Toshiba, voted against the management-backed break-up plan and in favour of the proposal from Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners.
Even though their stakes are small, support from such prominent institutional investors for 3D's proposal could add momentum to activist shareholder demands that the board fully explore alternatives to the break-up.
Earlier this week, one of Toshiba's external board directors said he would back 3D's proposal, breaking ranks with the public stance of the company board's.
Toshiba has said there is no change in the board's opinion in opposing the shareholder proposal and that it will continue to make every effort to gain shareholder support for the break-up plan.

Glass Lewis, an influential proxy advisory firm, has backed 3D's proposal but rival Institutional Shareholder Services has not recommended voting for it even though it is opposed to the spin-off plan.
Explaining the rational for its vote, Norway's fund - operated by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) - said it considers such factors as whether there is sufficient transparency and whether all shareholders are treated equitably when evaluating corporate transactions.

Judge Hiram Puig-Lugo of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia granted Amazon’s motion to dismiss the complaint filed last year by Washington D.C. attorney general Karl Racine.
""We believe that the Superior Court got this wrong, and its oral ruling did not seem to consider the detailed allegations in the complaint and a recent decision of a federal court to allow a nearly identical lawsuit to move forward,"" the Office of the Attorney General spokesperson said in an emailed statement, adding that the office was considering its legal options.
The decision did not state a reason for dismissing the case. 
Amazon did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 

Racine alleged the online retailer's policy could make prices for a given product more expensive on platforms that compete with Amazon, since its prices include fees that can run as high as 40% of the total price.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -SoftBank Group Corp's Vision Fund exited its bet on General Motors (NYSE:GM) self-driving car subsidiary Cruise as the auto giant upped the ante, investing another $3.45 billion in the loss-making unit. 
SoftBank's departure, which comes as the Japanese conglomerate struggles with debts, prompted questions from sector watchers about whether Cruise is ready to generate meaningful revenue for the time being, and how deep GM might have to dig to fund development.
GM said on Friday that it has agreed to pay $2.1 billion to buy the SoftBank Vision Fund stake in Cruise, and to make a separate $1.35 billion investment in the unit that SoftBank had committed to make in 2018. 
Combined, the transactions will bring GM's stake in Cruise to 80%, GM said. Other remaining shareholders in Cruise include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Honda Motor Co.
In 2018, SoftBank invested $900 million in Cruise and said it would invest another $1.35 billion when Cruise's autonomous vehicles were ready for commercial deployment, potentially bringing its stake to 20%. 
As recently as last month, Cruise said SoftBank would invest the $1.35 billion in the company as outlined in 2018.
A person briefed on the matter said SoftBank, including follow-on fundraising rounds after 2018, invested about $1.2 billion in Cruise in total. The person declined to be identified because the information was not public.
The SoftBank exit comes as Cruise awaits a regulatory permit to allow it to charge riders for a driverless ride-hailing service launched in San Francisco. 
""Based on the experience that we have seen from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Waymo in Arizona, the revenue that you will generate from that deployment will be very, very small,"" said Raj Rajkumar, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, referring to a project developed by the parent of Google.
""It is a long road ahead,"" he said, adding that GM and partners like Honda may have to ""dig deep into their pockets"" to fund the unit for the time being. 
SoftBank has its own internal problems to deal with. 
The value of marquee companies in the tech investor's portfolio have tumbled, hit by China's crackdown on tech companies, the prospect of higher interest rates and war in Ukraine.
""We will definitely be selling a good chunk of assets,"" SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said last month, as he pivots from the collapse of the sale of chip designer Arm to a plan to list it in the United States.
SoftBank declined to comment on the Cruise exit. 
In a statement, GM CEO Marry Barra said, ""GM is leveraging the strength of its balance sheet to capitalise on the opportunity to increase its equity investment in Cruise and advance our integrated autonomous vehicle strategy.""
Kyle Vogt, CEO and co-founder of Cruise, said in a series of tweets that Cruise would begin allowing employees to sell vested shares to GM once a quarter in an effort to give financial flexibility to employees.
Going public would be ""a major distraction, especially right now,"" he said, adding he wanted the company focused on scaling up the driverless ride-hail service launched in San Francisco. 
In December, GM announced that Dan Ammann, then chief executive of Cruise, was abruptly leaving the company. One person briefed on the matter said he was dismissed, while another source said he and GM disagreed over when to take Cruise public. 

Barra previously downplayed the need for a quick Cruise public offering. 
GM spokesman David Caldwell said the latest deal showed GM's belief in Cruise and simplified the ownership structure. He said that other shareholders in Cruise including Microsoft, Walmart and Honda, had technology partnerships, such as a delivery project with Walmart.

588,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 09:00PM ET</span>","After sizzling rebound, investors weigh whether stocks have more bounce","By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stormed back this week after absorbing a long-awaited rate hike from the Federal Reserve, leaving investors to determine whether stocks are set for a sustained rebound or more turbulence. 
Following a months-long drubbing, the S&P 500 delivered its best weekly gain since November 2020 as investors cheered increased clarity on monetary policy and an encouraging assessment of the U.S. economy from the Fed. The surge cut the index’s year-to-date losses by nearly half, though it is still down 6.7% for 2022 after falling into a correction last month.
Whether to hop on board the rally is a thorny question in a market that still faces its share of risks – chief among them the hawkish rate hike path the Fed unveiled on Wednesday and geopolitical uncertainty over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
Still, some big banks believe the worst may be over, for now. Strategists at UBS Global Wealth Management on Friday said the projected pace of Fed tightening is “consistent with rising stocks” and advised clients to remain invested in equities.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) earlier in the week forecast the S&P 500 would end the year at 4,900, about 10% above Friday’s close, saying that markets “have now cleared the much-anticipated Fed liftoff with policy likely as hawkish as it gets."" 
Others are less sanguine. Worries that the Fed’s fight against inflation could bruise growth were apparent in the bond market, where a flattening of the yield curve accelerated after the Fed's policy meeting this week. An inverted yield curve, in which yields of shorter-term government bonds rise above those of longer-term ones, has been a reliable predictor of past recessions.
Stubborn inflation, sky-high commodity prices and few signs of an end to the war in Ukraine further cloud the picture for investors, said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments. 
“The markets are more complicated now by interest rates, they are more complicated by inflation, and they are definitely more complicated by the Russian situation,” he said. “You had a lot of people in this week who thought we made a bottom, but it’s difficult to keep having higher and higher prices just based on that.” 
Many also believe the week’s sharp gains in stocks are unlikely to quiet the economic concerns that fanned bearish sentiment in recent months.

Bearish sentiment among retail investors is close to 50%, the latest survey from the American Association of Individual Investors showed, well above the historic average of 30.5%. 
""The thing we are most concerned about right now ... is really a question of whether we are going to go into a recession or not,” said King Lip, chief strategist at BakerAvenue Asset Management. 
Wary of a potential ""stagflationary"" environment of slowing growth and rising inflation, Lip's firm is investing in energy shares, commodities and precious metals such as gold ETFs or gold-mining stocks. 
Cresset Capital Management is recommending that clients underweight equities and raise their exposure to gold, which is viewed as a safe-haven asset, said Jack Ablin, Cresset's chief investment officer. 
“We see certainly a pretty aggressive Fed that has really made inflation-fighting its number one priority and not necessarily protecting equity market values,” Ablin said. 
To be sure, signs of rampant pessimism – such as high cash levels and dour sentiment -- are often seen as contrarian indicators that are positive for equities. Indeed, hedge funds tracked by BoFA Global Research were recently piling into cyclical stocks, which tend to thrive when economic growth is strong. 
“Despite weakening optimism on global growth, clients do not appear to be positioning for a recession,” BoFA’s strategists wrote. 

Stocks historically have weathered rate-hike cycles fairly well. Since 1983, the S&P 500 has returned an average of 5.3% in the six months following the first Fed rate rise of a cycle, data from UBS showed. 
""The Fed’s goal remains to engineer a soft landing for the economy,"" the firm's analysts wrote. ""We advise investors to prepare for higher rates while remaining engaged with equity markets.""

589,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 08:11PM ET</span>","Wall St closes higher after Biden-Xi talks end, oil steadies","By Sinéad Carew, Shreyashi Sanyal and Sabahatjahan Contractor
(Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes closed higher on Friday, with the biggest boost from recently battered technology stocks, after talks between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping over the Ukraine crisis ended without big surprises. 
Investors were also relieved by slowing gains in oil prices as they continued to digest the Federal Reserve's Wednesday interest rate increase and its aggressive plan for further hikes aimed at combating soaring inflation.
U.S. President Joe Biden warned Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a call that there would be ""consequences"" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the White House said. Both sides stressed the need for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
While Xi called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow, he did not assign blame to Russia for the invasion.
""The read out from the meeting was as expected,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York regarding the Xi/Biden talks. He said that since Russia/Ukraine talks were continuing, investors were tending toward optimism. 
""Regarding Russia, Ukraine, the market has been more positive on news from the diplomatic front than negative on the escalation."" 
Hogan also cited calmer oil prices and relief that the highly anticipated Fed news was finally out.
""Instead of having fears and trepidation of what the Fed might do we have clear roadmap for monetary policy,"" he said. 
In addition to less onerous than expected Fed actions, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) in Greenwich, Connecticut said investors were reassured that U.S. crude oil prices weren't too far above $100 on Friday after recently surpassing $130. [O/R] 
""At least for this week oil has found a level. That's someway positive for the market as a rising oil price is overweighted in consumer minds as an inflationary indicator,"" said Sosnick. ""Does the market like oil around $100? No. But is it happier that it's around $100 than going up $20 every day? Of course.""
Investors were also monitoring for any impact from Friday's ""triple witching,"" in which investors unwind positions in futures and options contracts before they expire, which can lead to volatility and trading volume.
On Friday the expirations appeared to boost volume as 18.47 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges compared with the 14.56 billion moving average for the last 20 sessions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 274.17 points, or 0.8%, to 34,754.93, the S&P 500 gained 51.45 points, or 1.17%, to 4,463.12 and the Nasdaq Composite added 279.06 points, or 2.05%, to 13,893.84.
Wall Street's three main indexes boasted their biggest weekly percentage gains since early November 2020 with the S&P adding 6.2% while the Dow rose 5.5% and the Nasdaq jumping 8.2%.
Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors closed higher, with heavyweight technology and consumer discretionary both finishing up 2.2% while communication services rising 1.4%.
The only declining sector was utilities which ended the session down 0.9%. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc closed up 6.3% after the drugmaker submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to allow for a second booster of its COVID-19 vaccine. 
Shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co finished up 1.4% after reports the planemaker was edging toward a landmark order from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) for up to 100 of its 737 MAX 10 jets.
But shares in U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) slumped almost 4% after a weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings report.

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.19-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 41 new lows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of U.S. lawmakers led by House Oversight chair Carolyn Maloney asked Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) Corp if it sought to avoid using union workers by deciding to build the next-generation U.S. Postal Service delivery vehicles in South Carolina.
Maloney and three other lawmakers want documents by April 1 from Oshkosh detailing the decision not to build the vehicles in Wisconsin and want the company to explain how quickly and how many electric delivery vehicles it can build.
The 10-year contract with Oshkosh's Defense unit makes an initial $482 million investment, but it could be worth $6 billion or more for the unit to build up to 165,000 next-generation delivery vehicles.
Oshkosh said Friday it concluded South Carolina ""would best meet the needs of this important program"" and added hiring and facility preparations are well underway ""to ensure Oshkosh will meet contractual deadlines for vehicle production to begin in 2023.""
The United Auto Workers union and some Democrats in Congress have been extremely critical of Oshkosh's decision to build the vehicles in South Carolina.
""Workers and the environment are relying on USPS and the Biden administration to take every possible step to ensure public dollars protect our next generation,"" UAW President Ray Curry said last month.
On Monday, Maloney and four other lawmakers asked the Postal Service Office of Inspector General (OIG) to review USPS's plan to buy a new fleet of primarily gasoline-powered delivery vehicles from Oshkosh, a plan that has come under fire from the White House and the Environmental Protection Agency.
The inspector general's office said Thursday it ""will be doing additional work in response to that request."" OIG said in a report https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2022/RISC-WP-22-003.pdf that EVs could be a ""good option"" on many USPS routes.

USPS said its commitment to ""an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our fragile financial condition.""
Oshkosh said Friday it can make any mix of vehicles USPS wants - up to 100% electric models.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 06:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Veon employees in bomb shelters keep Ukraine's biggest mobile network up -CEO,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Toby Sterling
STOCKHOLM/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Thousands of telecom operator Veon employees are working from bomb shelters in Ukraine and moving equipment to border areas to maintain a digital lifeline for refugees fleeing the war, the company's chief executive said on Friday.
Their work has helped some 85% of Veon's telecom network remain operational in Ukraine since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion, Veon CEO Kaan Terzioglu said in an exclusive interview with Reuters. But further risks loom both from electricity shortages and the conflict itself.
Amsterdam-listed Veon operates Ukraine's biggest cell phone provider under the name Kyivstar with 4,000 employees and a 25% market share.
Terzioglu, who spoke by Zoom conference call from the Netherlands, described how the company is coping with war, sanctions and financial concerns at the same time.
Terzioglu provided a lens through which one company is providing a phone network to a rapidly spreading diaspora.
Employees ""are practically working out of shelters and the moment they have the opportunity, they go out to the field to do maintenance,"" Terzioglu said.
The parts of the network which are not working were mostly because of loss of power and are not being targeted by Russian forces, he said. Getting these parts back up required workers to run gasoline to generators, which Terioglu described as ""one of the most logistically heavy jobs that our people are trying to do.""
Russia's attack, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarize the country, has killed hundreds of civilians, reduced city areas to rubble and sparked a humanitarian crisis. Russia denies targeting civilians in the country of about 44 million.
More than 3.2 million people have fled and an additional 2 million have been displaced internally, United Nations data showed.
On the basis of cell phone data, Terzioglu estimated that 4 million refugees had left, and 10 million were displaced.
Apart from opening up its offices as refugee shelters, Veon has also topped up mobile accounts without charge, said Terzioglu, who became Veon's group CEO last July. In his previous job as Turkcell CEO he grappled with the Syrian refugee crisis. 
Veon has also received support from American, Chinese and European companies in the tech and telecom industry. While operators such as Orange, Tele2 and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) have waived off interconnection and roaming charges, equipment makers such as Huawei and ZTE (HK:0763) have been helping in network maintenance. These and companies including Ericsson (BS:ERICAs), Nokia (NYSE:NOK),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), and  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) have made a ""heroic effort"" to keep the networks running, Terzioglu said. 
RUSSIAN CONNECTION
Veon also owns the second-largest telecom network in Russia, operating under the name of Beeline, its most profitable market. That means Veon must navigate the impact of sanctions and political concerns on both sides of the border.
Veon has about 29,000 employees in Russia and the company has taken steps to operate its Ukraine and Russian businesses as separate from one another.
The company has also moved quickly to distance itself from Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman, whose investment vehicle LetterOne holds a 47.9% stake in Veon, and an additional 8.3% economic stake through a Dutch foundation.
The European Union imposed sanctions on Fridman on Feb. 28, a decision he said he would fight.
Terzioglu said Fridman, who resigned from Veon's board Feb. 28 and LetterOne's board on March 3, now ""has no economic interest in LetterOne.""
LetterOne, which did not respond to a request for comment, said March 3 that Fridman's assets had been frozen and he had been stripped of shareholder rights.
Terzioglu said he could not speculate as to whether the company could eventually face EU sanctions or nationalization by the Russian government, but he hoped that it would be excluded on humanitarian grounds.
""We will do our best to position it as a service that is essential,"" he said.
Veon also faces financial worries, with its shares down 56% in the year to date, and its U.S. dollar denominated debt - $5.4 billion worth at the end of 2021 - trading at distressed levels. 
On March 4, Fitch downgraded the company's credit ratings to junk status, saying that together Russia and Ukraine accounted for 62% of 2021 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $3.3 billion.
Russian capital controls and the war meant the company may not be able to move funds in or out of either country.
The company has issued several updates to reassure investors it remains liquid, with $2.1 billion in cash as of the end of February, of which $1.5 billion is in the Netherlands.

Terzioglu said he was aware of reports https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/veon-bondholders-enlist-advisors-ahead-of-planned-debt-talks-1.1739259 of a group of bondholders seeking talks and welcomed the opportunity to address them, though none have reached the company so far.
""Having them organized gives us the opportunity to explain why they should not be worried, and that we are well funded in terms of meeting our obligations,"" he said.

592,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 05:55PM ET</span>",Russia tells Google to stop spreading threats against Russians on YouTube,"(Reuters) -Russia on Friday demanded that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google stop spreading what it called threats against Russian citizens on its YouTube video-sharing platform, a move that could presage an outright block of the service on Russian territory. 
The regulator, Roskomnadzor, said adverts on the platform were calling for the communications systems of Russia and Belarus' railway networks to be suspended and that their dissemination was evidence of the U.S. company's anti-Russian position. It did not say which accounts were publishing the adverts.
""The actions of YouTube's administration are of a terrorist nature and threaten the life and health of Russian citizens,"" the regulator said. 
""Roskomnadzor categorically opposes such advertising campaigns and demands that Google stop broadcasting anti-Russia videos as soon as possible.""
Google removed an advertisement that was flagged by the Russian government, according to a source familiar with the matter who declined to describe it.
The dispute was the latest in a series between Moscow and foreign tech firms over Ukraine.
YouTube, which has blocked Russian state-funded media globally, is under heavy pressure from Russia's communications regulator and politicians. 
Outraged that Meta Platforms was allowing social media users in Ukraine to post messages such as ""Death to the Russian invaders"", Moscow blocked Instagram this week, having already stopped access to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) because of what it said were restrictions by the platform on Russian media.
Russian news media including RIA and Sputnik quoted an unnamed source as saying YouTube could be blocked next week or as early as Friday. 
DOMESTIC ALTERNATIVES
Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on Friday wrote a fierce criticism of foreign social media firms, mentioning by name both Meta and YouTube, but he hinted that the door leading to their possible return to the Russian market would be left ajar.
""The 'guardians' of free speech have in all seriousness allowed users of their social media to wish death upon the Russian military,"" Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, wrote on the messaging app Telegram.
Medvedev said Russia has the necessary tools and experience to develop its own social media, saying the ""one-way game"" of Western firms controlling information flows could not continue.
""In order to return, they will have to prove their independence and good attitude to Russia and its citizens,"" he wrote. ""However, it is not a fact that they will be able to dip their toes in the same water twice."" 
VKontakte, Russia's answer to Facebook, has been breaking records for activity on its platform since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The site attracted 300,000 new users in the two weeks after Russia began what it calls a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" its neighbour.
On the day Instagram was blocked in Russia, VKontakte said its daily domestic audience grew by 8.7% to more than 50 million people, a new record.
Anton Gorelkin, a member of Russia's State Duma committee on information and communications, pointed Russians to services that would help them move videos from YouTube to the domestic equivalent, RuTube. 
""It's not that I'm calling for everyone to immediately leave YouTube,"" he said on his Telegram channel. ""But, probably, in light of recent events it is worth following the principle of not keeping all your eggs in one basket."" 
He said earlier this week that YouTube may face the same fate as Instagram if it continues ""to act as a weapon in the information war"".

Russian tech entrepreneurs said this week they would launch picture-sharing application Rossgram on the domestic market to help fill the void left by Instagram.
In November, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) Media launched Yappy as a domestic rival to video-sharing platform TikTok.

The company said that with this refinancing, it extended the current debt for two extra years, with a new maturity in January and March 2026.

594,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 04:39PM ET</span>",U.S. booking sites seeing strong demand for 2022 travel,"By Doyinsola Oladipo
(Reuters) - U.S. booking sites including Vrbo, Hopper and KAYAK are seeing higher demand for spring and summer leisure travel as COVID-19 restrictions ease and travelers appear to be shrugging off added costs to plane tickets and road trips from rising fuel prices. 
""We are seeing strong booking activity for spring break and the beginnings of a very strong summer,"" said Jamie Lane, VP of research at AirDNA, which tracks the daily performance of over 10 million properties on vacation rental firms Airbnb and Vrbo.
Oil has soared over $100 a barrel as Russia's invasion of Ukraine jolted global markets. But U.S. carriers including Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), United Airline Holdings Inc and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Inc this week reported a strong rebound in travel demand after the blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant.
AirDNA data said the booking pace for travel in the northern hemisphere spring is 49% higher than this time last year, and 26% higher than pre-pandemic 2019. 
""The rush to book summer vacation homes has further accelerated in 2022,"" said Vrbo in a statement earlier this month. The vacation rental booking platform reports demand for properties is already outpacing last summer by 15%.
""When reviewing the booking data, it's clear that Omicron was a bigger concern for travelers than rising fuel costs,"" said Dakota Smith, Chief Strategy Officer at Hopper, a travel booking app.
The app, which is popular among younger travelers, has seen a 50% increase in travel booking since fourth-quarter 2021.
Airline carriers are counting on strong demand to deal with the rising fuel costs. Some airlines intend to pass along a majority of that increase to customers.
""As gas prices reach record highs, jet fuel prices may not be far behind... this summer travel season may be a pricey one,"" said Paul Jacobs, GM and VP of KAYAK North America. Flight prices were up 17% last week compared to the same week in 2019, according to KAYAK.
The rising fuel costs will have less impact on domestic and short-haul flights, though, and indications are that the pandemic-era preference from U.S. travelers for those trips is continuing, and may remain while the war in Ukraine drags on, said Hopper's Smith.
Hopper said U.S. bookings to Europe have dropped from 21% of Hopper's international bookings to 15% since Feb. 12, with international bookings shifting toward Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. These locations now represent 61% of Hopper's international bookings, according to Smith. Europe accounted for approximately 30% of Hopper's international bookings in 2019.

Business travel and travel to urban locations has yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels, according to AirDNA.
Investors will also get another view on the recovery of leisure travel when Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp reports earnings on Tuesday. Carnival on average is expected to post a loss of $1.21 a share, while revenue soars to over $2 billion, according to data from Refinitiv.

595,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 04:37PM ET</span>",Google is accused in lawsuit of systemic bias against Black employees,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - A lawsuit filed on Friday accuses Google of systemic racial bias against Black employees, saying the search engine company steers them to lower-level jobs, pays them less and denies them opportunities to advance because of their race.
According to a complaint seeking class-action status, Google maintains a ""racially biased corporate culture"" that favors white men, where Black people comprise only 4.4% of employees and about 3% of leadership and its technology workforce.
The plaintiff, April Curley, also said the Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc unit subjected Blacks to a hostile work environment, including by often requiring they show identification or be questioned by security at its Mountain View, California campus.
Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The complaint was filed in the federal court in San Jose, California.
It came after that state's civil rights regulator, the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, began investigating Google's treatment of Black female workers and possible discrimination in their workplace.
Curley said Google hired her in 2014 to design an outreach program to historically Black colleges.
She said her hiring proved to be a ""marketing ploy,"" as supervisors began denigrating her work, stereotyping her as an ""angry"" Black woman and passing her over for promotions.
Curley said Google fired her in September 2020 after she and her colleagues began working on a list of desired reforms.
""While Google claims that they were looking to increase diversity, they were actually undervaluing, underpaying and mistreating their Black employees,"" Curley's lawyer Ben Crump said in a statement.
Crump is a civil rights lawyer who also represented the family of George Floyd after he was killed in May 2020 by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin.

Curley's lawsuit seeks to recoup compensatory and punitive damages and lost compensation for current and former Black employees at Google, and to restore them to their appropriate positions and seniority.
The case is Curley v Google LLC, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01735.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Burger King's parent company said on Thursday it has not been able to close its 800 restaurants in Russia because its independent operator there ""refused"" to do so.
Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc said that to enforce its contracts with the partner, Alexander Kolobov, it would need the help of the Russian government, but ""we know that will not practically happen anytime soon,"" according to a letter to employees from David Shear, president, international, of the company.
Kolobov said in a statement to Reuters that he does not have the authority or power to decide whether to suspend restaurant operations.
Shear's long letter and Kolobov's response highlight the many complications bedeviling some American fast-food brands as they try to halt operations in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
It also exposes what can become a point of weakness in international franchising, which is how most American restaurant brands expand overseas: the relationships with their independent operators.
On March 8,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and a wave of other companies followed McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) in saying they would suspend or limit operations in Russia.
Like Burger King, Starbucks does not own or operate its more than 100 cafes there. 
But unlike Burger King, it had a willing partner - Kuwait-based Alshaya Group - that immediately agreed to shut its Starbucks' locations in Russia and support its 2,000 employees.
Restaurant Brands entered Russia a decade ago through a joint venture partnership with three entities: Kolobov, who controls day-to-day operations, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia's state-owned VTB Bank, which has been hit by Western sanctions.
Restaurant Brands has started the process to dispose of its 15% ownership stake in the joint venture. It wants to do so immediately, Shear said, but it will take ""some time"" based on the terms of the agreement.
There are ""no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote.

""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today?"" he wrote. ""No.""
Kolobov said he has never had control of operations since the joint venture formed in 2012. He controls 30% of the partnership and said the decision to suspend operations ""must be taken by all shareholders considering the impact it may have"" on approximately 25,000 employees.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 rallied Friday to post its best week since November 2020, led by tech as the broader market shrugged off Federal Reserve officials calling on the central bank to get even more aggressive on rate hikes that many fear could slow the economy too much.
The S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.8%, or 273 points, the Nasdaq rose 2.1%. The gains ensured that all three major averages posted their best week in 16 months. 
Tech continued its comeback to remain on course to snap a two-week losing streak as investors continued to pile into big tech.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) led the pack up more than 4%, followed by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) up more than 2%, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), were up more than 1% each.
Chip stocks were also in the ascendency, supported by a more than 6% gain in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the chipmaker extended its rally for a fourth straight day.
Growth sectors of the market like tech were also helped by falling interest rates even as Fed officials urged the central bank to do even more.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Friday called on the Fed to consider more aggressive rate hikes and get balance sheet reduction underway to make a dent in the pace of the inflation.
The remarks arrived on the heels of remarks from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who suggested the Fed hike rates by 50 basis points several times this year to push the central bank’s benchmark rate to 3% by year end.
That would be well above the Fed’s current outlook for rates to reach about 1.9% by year end.
Industrials struggled to join in on the broader market rally pressured by weakness in defense stocks and a slump in FedEx.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fell 4% after reporting quarterly results that missed both the top and bottom lines as higher labor costs hurt results.
Defense stocks including Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) and L3Harris Technologies Inc (NYSE:LHX) ended in the red as investors appeared to be pricing in the prospect of progress on Ukraine-Russia peace talks that could prove key to ending the war.
On the geopolitical front, President Joe Biden warned Chinese President Xi Jinping of ""consequences"" should Beijing support Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Bloomberg reported. 
In other news, GameStop (NYSE:GME) ended the day more than 3% higher despite delivering a surprise fourth quarter loss.
Stocks were expected to have a volatile end to the week as triple witching -- when stock options, stock index futures, and index option contracts expire on the same day -- usually triggers wild moves as investors move out of old positions and take new ones.
The rally in the broader market has stoked debate on whether this is the start of a bottoming process, or further downside lies ahead.
Market technicians, however, urge caution on reading too much into the rally as options expiry tends to muddy market movements. Technical indicators including volume and market breadth have yet to improve significantly to signal that the market is establishing a bottom.
“If this is the beginning of something more broad based, you’d want market breadth conditions to improve meaningfully … volume being strong as the price is going higher, but I think the jury's still out on that,""  Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
“At at this point, I'm still thinking of it as a tradable bounce within a downtrend.” Keller added."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Two U.S. House Democratic lawmakers on Friday asked Hertz Global Holdings (OTC:HTZGQ), and  Avis Budget  (NASDAQ:CAR) Group to answer questions about rising rental car prices and higher industry profits.
Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, chairman of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, and Representative Katie Porter said both rental car firms appear to have used their market position to raise prices as expenses fell. 
They said in a statement they want documents and information by April 1 ""from both companies explaining the increases in rental car prices despite falling costs, as well as a list of any known investigations into these price increases.""
The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawmakers' letters said the financial results suggest the firms ""may have prioritized maximum profits and 
shareholder payouts at consumers’ expense"" and ""may have 
engaged in predatory business practices during the pandemic, taking advantage of consumers who rely on affordable rental car prices.""
Last month, Hertz posted a record adjusted profit in the fourth quarter as demand for rental cars remained strong, but post-bankruptcy restructuring costs yielded a large net loss.

Avis Budget said in February it had record revenues https://ir.avisbudgetgroup.com/news-releases/news-release-details/avis-budget-group-reports-record-revenues-net-income-and and net income in the quarter ending Dec. 31. 
The higher revenue is the result of an industry-wide drastic increase in prices as customer demand outstrips vehicle supply with consumers returning to the rental counter for leisure and business travel, analysts say.

602,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 03:36PM ET</span>",How Russia could use bankruptcy law to punish foreign companies,"(Corrects paragraph 8 to indicate that U.S. bankruptcy is primarily civil, not purely civil)
By Dietrich Knauth
(Reuters) -As foreign companies seek to exit Russia over the war in Ukraine, they face the prospect that Russian bankruptcy law could be used to seize assets and even lead to criminal penalties.
Here is how that could work:
HOW DOES RUSSIA'S BANKRUPTCY LAW DIFFER FROM BANKRUPTCY LAW IN THE UNITED STATES? 
In the United States, bankruptcy laws are meant to give indebted companies a fresh start. 
Distressed companies in the United States usually enter bankruptcy willingly and the law lets them retain existing management and control over assets.
Russia's law, however, generally prioritizes the needs of creditors who are owed money. This means creditors, including the Russian government, can force a company into involuntary bankruptcy and oust its management.
Some legal experts said foreign companies fear Russian creditors could abuse that process to install leaders willing to sell their assets to business rivals or companies aligned with the Russian government.
""In the late 90s and early aughts, this was often used as the device to raid companies"" in post-Soviet Russia, said Paul Stephan, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and expert in the Soviet and post-Soviet legal systems. 
CAN A BANKRUPT COMPANY FACE CRIMINAL PENALTIES IN RUSSIA?
Yes. In the United States, bankruptcy is primarily civil. But Russian courts have been more willing to pursue criminal penalties for some bankruptcy-related offenses, such as hiding assets.
Camel and Lucky Strike cigarette maker British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Plc has expressed concern that its exit from Russia could be viewed as a criminal act that leads to bankruptcy-related charges for local management. 
It would not be the first time the Russian government has threatened criminal bankruptcy charges against foreign companies and investors. Russia has repeatedly asked Interpol to arrest money manager Bill Browder, alleging charges against him including deliberate bankruptcy and tax evasion. 
Browder has said that the ""bogus warrants"" are part of a vendetta by corrupt officials in the Russian state. Interpol has not acceded to Russia's arrest demands. 
HAS RUSSIAN BANKRUPTCY LAW BEEN USED IN THE PAST TO PUNISH COMPANIES FOR POLITICAL REASONS? 
Yes. Tax debt has been used to drive companies into bankruptcy in Russia, in a way that penalizes foreign investors, according to an international arbitration court.
Yukos Oil was forced into bankruptcy in 2006 after its former chief, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, fell out with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the Russian government demanded billions in back taxes. 
Most of Yukos' assets were absorbed by the Kremlin's flagship oil producer Rosneft, but international shareholders argued that the Russian tax demands were illegitimate. The Permanent Court of arbitration in The Hague agreed, finding in 2014 that the Kremlin had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt the company and take Khodorkovsky's assets. 
Since the Russian government owns major energy companies, it could use energy bills as well as taxes to force a company into bankruptcy, experts said.
""If the government was using that power strategically, it may well have the ability to influence local courts, to influence local managers, and force a sale of the company that would oust foreign owners,"" said Jason Kilborn, a law professor at University of Illinois Chicago. 
IS THERE A SAFE WAY FOR COMPANIES TO LEAVE RUSSIA?
For companies that want to leave Russia, Russian officials have suggested a ""fast-track"" bankruptcy procedure that would put local managers in charge of their assets and operations. 
Still, some businesses are concerned that Russian bankruptcy law will be used to retaliate against the companies that are leaving, experts said. 
""If the hammer really comes down, you just hope that you've gotten as many people as you have out of the country, and you've minimized your asset risk in the country,"" Stephan said.

Russia's ruling party has recently proposed legislation that would allow the government to nationalize the assets of certain companies intending to leave Russia.
That proposal would build on the bankruptcy law's procedure for installing court-appointed external management, but could be wielded against companies with no debt, experts said.

The company's shares, which were at the heart of the 2021 meme stocks saga, fell 7% in extended trading.
""The combination of supply chain issues and the Omicron variant had a sizable impact on this past year's holiday season,"" Chief Executive Officer Matt Furlong said on an earnings conference call.
Usually, the holiday quarter is a strong one for the company as new Xboxes and Playstations are launched and demand is high. But component shortages and other supply chain issues, which had hit console makers like  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), impacted GameStop's business.
Like many other retailers, GameStop has already suffered as the pandemic wreaked havoc with curbs leading to store closures. The spread of the Omicron variant further exacerbated the situation.
The company's net sales rose 6.2% to $1.88 billion, while its gross profit fell 15.7% during the quarter ended Jan. 29.
Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter noted that the company's gross profit fell ""due to exceptionally poor gross margins.""
""It's likely that used game sales were low and lower margin than normal and that hardware sales were higher than normal.""
GameStop has also been ramping up spending to hire talent, expand capacity, grow its e-commerce presence and also introduce new products to boost its digital presence. 

The company on Thursday also said it intends to launch its marketplace for non-fungible tokens or NFTs by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. 
The company posted a net loss of $147.5 million, or $1.94 per share, during the quarter, compared with a profit of $80.5 million, or $1.19 per share, a year earlier.

Investing.com -- Shares of  Joann  Inc (NASDAQ:JOAN), the specialty retailer of crafts and fabrics, plunged 10% Friday after posting fourth-quarter earnings after the bell Thursday that missed analyst expectations.
Revenue was $735.3 million, missing analyst expectations of $752.33 million. Sales declined by 12.5% compared to the same period last year, with total comparable sales decreasing 12.4%.

The company said it had to absorb close to $60 million of higher ocean freight costs this past year.
“We’ve now completed our first full year as a public company. During Fiscal 2022, we achieved a number of critical milestones which we expect will underpin our continued growth longer term.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 climbed Friday, led by tech as the broader market shrugged off Federal Reserve officials calling on the central bank to get even more aggressive on rate hikes that many fear could slow the economy too much.
The S&P 500 rose 1.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%, or 63 points, the Nasdaq rose 0.7%.
Tech continued to its comeback to remain on course to snap a two-week losing streak as investors continued to pile into big tech.
Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) led the pack up more than 3%, following by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), up more than 1% each.
Chip stocks were also in the ascendency, supported by a nearly 6% gain in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the chipmaker extended its rally for a fourth straight day.
Growth sectors of the market like tech were also helped by falling interest rates even as Fed officials urged the central bank to do even more.
Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller on Friday called on the Fed to consider more aggressive rate hikes and get balance sheet reduction underway to make a dent in the pace of the inflation.
The remarks arrived on the heels of remarks from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who suggested the Fed hike rates by 50 basis points several times this year to push the central bank’s rate to 3% by year end.
That would be well above the Fed’s current outlook for rates to reach about 1.9% by year end.
Industrials struggled to join in on the broader market rally pressured by weakness in defense stocks and a slump in FedEx.
FedEx (NYSE:FDX) fell more than 5% after reporting quarterly results that missed both the top and bottom lines as higher labor costs hurt results.
Defense stocks including Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) and L3Harris Technologies Inc (NYSE:LHX) were down more than 2% as investors appeared to be pricing in the prospect of progress on Ukraine-Russia peace talks that could prove key to ending the war.
Stocks are expected to have a volatile end to the session as triple witching -- when stock options, stock index futures, and index option contracts expire on the same day -- usually triggers wild moves as investors move out of old positions and take new ones.
The rally in the broader market has stoked debate on whether this is the start of a bottoming process, or further downside lies ahead.
Market technicians, however, urge caution on reading too much into the rally as options expiry tends to muddy market movements. Technical indicators including volumes and market breadth have yet to improve significantly to signal that the market is establishing a bottom.
“If this is the beginning of something more broad based, you’d want market breadth conditions to improve meaningfully … volume being strong as the price is going higher, but I think the jury's still out on that,""  Chief Market Strategist David Keller at StockCharts told Investing.com in an interview on Friday.
“At at this point, I'm still thinking of it as a tradable bounce within a downtrend.” Keller added."

Investing.com --  Wingstop Inc  (NASDAQ:WING) fell Friday after Piper Sandler double downgraded the stock to underweight from overweight.
Analyst Nicole Miller Regan also slashed the price target on Wingstop by nearly 50%, going from $195 per share to $102. Regan said the price target cut reflects lower earnings estimates which mirror “a lower royalty rate, revised advertising expense ratio, higher interest expense, and higher tax rate.”
""We have taken time to review checks, refine our model, apply a macro overlay, and finally weigh the restaurant industry cycle against our rating,"" the analyst said.
Adding: ""We fully understand and respect the recent executive shift with no material concern, or impact on this assessment. We do, however, expect WING shares to experience resistance in terms of garnering the same premium multiple in the face of a restaurant industry expansion cycle.”
Wingstop shares fell 4% in early Friday trading. However, they have recouped most of those losses and now trade just 0.3% below yesterday's closing price.

While only a few countries, including the United States, Canada and Australia, have imposed outright bans, some buyers in Europe are shunning Russian oil to avoid reputational damage or possible legal troubles. 
Some 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil and products may not find their way to market beginning in April, the International Energy Agency estimates.
Russian officials, however, expressed hope that supplies would remain stable, while oil exports and transit from the country's western ports and Druzhba pipeline were expected to rise in the second quarter. 
Following are actions announced by countries and major European energy companies:
WHO IS STILL BUYING RUSSIAN OIL?

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts have slashed their forecasts for McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD)'s 2022 and 2023 profit, the latest sign that some Western companies stand to take a financial hit as the costs of Russia's invasion of Ukraine grow.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) on Thursday said it now expects net profit from the fast food company of $9.25 a share for this year and $10.62 for 2023, reductions of 8% and 3%, respectively, from its prior view.
Earlier, the research firm Gordon Haskett cut its estimate by 5% in 2022 to $9.75 a share and by 3% for 2023 to $10.66 a share. 
McDonald's declined to comment on the moves.
The American burger chain - among the first to open in Moscow in the post-Soviet era - is paying for leases and wages for its 62,000 employees in Russia, despite starting to close 847 restaurants there, most of which it owns and operates. It is also paying wages for its Ukraine staff. 
The cost is expected to be $50 million a month, or at least $450 million through the end of this year. 
Stores in Russia and Ukraine - which are now shuttered - would normally generate operating profit of roughly $310 million annually, according to Gordon Haskett.
The Chicago-based company also faces potential hits to the value of its assets in Russia, whether through a mark down, sale to a local owner or government seizure, according to Morgan Stanley, which did not factor those into its lowered profit estimates.
The bank still finds McDonald's shares attractive because they can hold up in uncertain consumer environments.
McDonald's has more exposure to Russia than other global fast-food chains. It entered the country in 1990 and owns 84% of its restaurants there.
Other brands including  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Burger King are less exposed in Russia. Their restaurants are largely owned by independent operators under joint ventures and master franchisee agreements.
After McDonald's, Yum Brands Inc, parent to KFC and Pizza Hut, is most exposed. Russia and Ukraine account for about 3% of its consolidated operating income, Gordon Haskett analysts said. That is about $64 million based on 2021 figures, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data.
Morningstar analysts have not changed their forecasts for McDonald's or Yum. But on March 8, said they are concerned about higher fuel prices related to the war and the impact on consumer spending and restaurant margins.

McDonald's global operating income reached $10.4 billion in 2021, Refinitiv data showed.
While McDonald's has said the Russia closures are temporary, Gordon Haskett analysts said they believe the stores in Russia with the iconic golden arches will remain shuttered into 2023.

(Reuters) - A number of Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) drivers are considering quitting the app-based ride-hailing platforms as fueling up becomes costlier, with some calling the newly announced surcharges ""insulting"".
The companies announced this month a 55-cent per-ride surcharge that would be paid directly to drivers, in response to record gas prices because of the Ukraine crisis.
But Uber and Lyft drivers, who form a big chunk of the gig economy and typically pay for their own gas, are not happy.
A survey of over 300 drivers conducted by the Rideshare Guy, a popular blog followed by drivers, showed about 15% of them had already quit driving and nearly 40% were driving less.
""It's rather insulting that they even suggest 55 cents per ride because you have rides that are two minutes long and then you have rides that are an hour long,"" said Fabricio Lombeyda, a part-time driver in Buford, Georgia.
Uber and Lyft, however, have said the number of active drivers on their platforms is steadily rising, as people return to offices, book more rides to airports and nightlife resumes.
""We've not seen a decline in the number of drivers on the platform or the hours they drive when, for example, you compare March to January,"" Lyft said in a statement.
Lyft cited an internal analysis that showed drivers in the United States were spending on average of 75 cents more on gas per hour, but were still earning more per hour than they were a year ago, when the pandemic dimmed demand for rideshare.
Uber lifted its core profit forecast earlier this month on faster-than-expected growth in rideshare demand.
Both companies, however, face the prospect of drivers quitting as runaway fuel prices burn a hole in their pockets.
""There is some risk of driver departures, otherwise you would not have seen both Uber and Lyft institute surcharges,"" MScience analyst Michael Erstad said.
Another survey by Coworker.org that polled over 200 participants showed 90% agreed the surcharges were just not sufficient and that they would not be able to afford to take longer rides.
The business model of ride-hailing companies was based on gas being $3 per gallon, said David Marcotte, a senior vice president at data analytics firm Kantar.
But gas prices on Friday stood at $4.27 per gallon, even surpassing $5 a gallon in some parts of the country.
He also warned a rollback of the surcharge could cause more problems in an already strained labor market, making a loose connection to retail workers seeking better wages after the reversal of ""hero pay"" offered during the height of the pandemic.

For now, drivers are caught between a rock and a hard place.
""First and foremost, we have been trying to get higher wages per trip even before the gas prices went up. Now to insult us with this minimal amount is ridiculous,"" a participant in the Coworker survey said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department on Friday moved to effectively ground 100 airplanes that have recently flown to Russia and are believed to violate U.S. export controls, including a plane used by Russian businessman Roman Abramovich.
The list includes 99 Boeing (NYSE:BA) airplanes operated by Russian passenger and cargo carriers including Aeroflot, AirBridge Cargo, Utair, Nordwind, Azur Air and Aviastar-TU -- as well as Abramovich's Gulfstream G650 -- and could further hinder Russian efforts to continue some international flights.
Reuters first reported the planned action on Friday.
The Commerce Department warned companies and other entities around the world that any refueling, maintenance, repair, or spare parts or services violate U.S. export controls and subject companies to U.S. enforcement actions that could include ""substantial jail time, fines, loss of export privileges, or other restrictions,"" the department said.
The department said in a statement the action means ""international flights from Russia on these aircraft are effectively grounded."" Officials told Reuters said it could also prevent domestic Russia flights because of U.S. enforcement actions that could target companies servicing planes in Russia.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimando said in a statement the department is ""publishing this list to put the world on notice—we will not allow Russian and Belarusian companies and oligarchs to travel with impunity in violation of our laws.""
The department released specific tail numbers https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2022/03/commerce-department-identifies-commercial-and-private-aircraft-exported of the planes, including 33 Boeing planes operated by Aeroflot, and 12 Boeing 747 cargo planes operated by AirBridge Cargo, a unit of Russia's biggest cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Group.
Aeroflot and a spokesperson for Abramovich, who owns the English soccer club Chelsea did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Volga-Dnepr declined to immediately comment but said Friday it has suspended all flights using Boeing aircraft citing sanctions and a decision by Bermuda's Civil Aviation Authority to terminate their safety certificates.
The United States, Canada and much of Europe have barred Russian planes from flying over their airspace, which has forced the cancellation of much of Russia's international flights.
The rules apply to any U.S. manufactured aircraft or any with more than 25% U.S.-origin controlled content that were re-exported to Russia after the new stringent controls on aviation-related items for Russia took effect on Feb. 24.
Deputy Commerce Secretary Don Graves said in a statement the series of U.S. actions ""have isolated Russia and Belarus from the global economy, and I hope that today’s action brings that fact home to the Russian businesses and oligarchs that seek to continue their operations.""
This week, Reuters reported Russian airlines have weeks to orchestrate alternative supplies of banned aircraft parts or start grounding jets to avoid safety concerns as Western sanctions following Russian's invasion of Ukraine threaten their post-Soviet revival.
Moscow took a first step this week towards keeping its commercial fleet flying by allowing its airlines to re-register leased planes in Russia, giving local authorities direct control over the certificates of airworthiness needed for each jet.
Western analysts say airlines may start stripping some of Russia's 500 foreign-leased jets within weeks or even days for parts while shopping around for genuine, but resold, parts from countries such as China.
Boeing said earlier this month it was suspending parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines.

The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said since March 2, based on publicly available information, it ""identified a number of commercial and private flights from third countries to Russia"" and could add more planes as it continues its review.
Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Export Enforcement Matthew S. Axelrod said the ""action lets Vladimir Putin’s enablers know that, as a consequence of their actions, they have fewer places to hide and fewer ways to get there.""

614,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 01:50PM ET</span>","U.S. home sales tumble; higher prices, mortgage rates eroding affordability","By Lucia Mutikani
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales fell by the most in a year in February as a perennial shortage of houses and double-digit price growth continued to squeeze first-time buyers out of the market.
With mortgage rates rising above 4% for the first time in nearly three years, sales are likely to slow this year, though that would do little to curb house price inflation. Contracts to buy previously owned houses, a leading indicator of home sales, fell for three straight months through January.
""It will take a sharper drop in sales to bring the market back into balance and allow prices to increase at a more modest pace,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.
Existing home sales dropped 7.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.02 million units last month, the largest decrease since February 2021, the National Association of Realtors said on Friday. 
Though the decline reversed January's jump, sales remained above their pre-pandemic level. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast sales would decrease to a rate of 6.10 million units.
Sales fell in all four U.S. regions. Home resales account for the bulk of U.S. home sales. They dropped 2.4% on a year-on-year basis in February.
Mortgage rates surged in February, with the 30-year fixed rate approaching a three-year high, according to data from mortgage finance agency  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC). It averaged 4.16% in the week ending March 17, breaking above 4.0% for the first time since May 2019. 
Still low by historical standards, mortgage rates are set to increase further after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised its policy interest rate by 25 basis points, the first hike in more than three years, and laid out an aggressive plan to push borrowing costs to restrictive levels by 2023.
""Home buyers have likely missed their opportunity to lock in ultra-low mortgage rates,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
But Vitner also noted that the 30-year conventional mortgage has been higher than its current level for more than 90% of the time over the past 30 years, which he said was ""an important reminder that home sales should remain fairly strong even if mortgage rates rise a bit further."" 
A separate report from the Conference Board on Friday showed a gauge of future U.S. economic activity rebounded in February, suggesting the expansion would persist despite tighter monetary policy and uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Stocks on Wall Street were higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were largely lower.
TIGHT SUPPLY
Higher mortgage rates and rising homes prices amid a prolonged housing shortage will reduce affordability, especially for first-time buyers. The median existing house price increased 15% from a year earlier to $357,300 in February. House prices have increased on a year-on-year basis for a record 120 straight months.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Securities expects strong house price growth will continue this year and into 2023 because of tight supply.
Sales remained concentrated in the upper-price end of the market. Sales in the much sought after $100,000-$250,000 price range plunged 26.1% from a year ago.
According to the NAR, the typical monthly mortgage payment has surged 28% from a year ago, a huge burden for first-time buyers, who accounted for only 29% of sales last month. Economists and realtors say a 40% share of first-time buyers is needed for a robust housing market.
""Home prices inflating with higher interest rates together is a toxic brew that forces us to downgrade our forecast for housing sales later this year,"" said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS in New York. ""More bad news is coming your way if you are actively trying to buy a new home."" 
There were 870,000 previously owned homes on the market in February, down 15.5% from a year ago. Supply is likely to remain tight as builders struggle with shortages and high prices for key materials like lumber, which is used for framing.
Data from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed the backlog of homes yet to be build reached a fresh record high in February. A National Association of Home Builders survey this week showed homebuilder confidence dropped to a six-month low in March due to supply constraints and inflation. 
At February's sales pace, it would take 1.7 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 2.0 months a year ago. A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand.

All-cash sales accounted for 25% of transactions last month, up from 22% a year ago. Individual investors or second-home buyers made up 19% of sales last month, up from 17% in February 2021. With supply tight, houses typically stayed on the market for 18 days last month, down from 20 days in February 2021. 
Eighty-four percent of homes sold in February were on the market for less than a month.

He said talks between Chinese and U.S. regulators on Chinese companies listed in the United States have made positive progress and regulators are working on specific cooperation plans. 
U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday spoke on a two-hour video call about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Chinese media said Xi underlined that such conflicts are in no-one's interests. 
China's securities regulator said on Wednesday it would continue to communicate with U.S. regulators and strive to reach an agreement on China-U.S. audit supervision cooperation as soon as possible. 
Didi, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange in June 2021, has been the target of a probe by Chinese authorities who have asked it to take down its app from mobile app stores while its handling of customer data was under investigation.

Commenting on Didi's stock price surge on Friday, Michael Hewson, Chief Market Analyst at CMC Markets UK said, ""This is a bit of a repricing of Didi because it really didn't move in the first couple of days of the rebound that we saw earlier this week."" 
S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky said Didi had reduced its short exposure over the last month, while its shares were shorted when its price weakened recently.

Sanctions have cut off the supply of most aircraft and parts to Russia. The United States and Europe have closed their airspace to Russian airlines, and Moscow has responded by imposing the same measure on them. 
Volga-Dnepr said in a statement it had stopped operations of two of its subsidaries - AirBridgeCargo and Atran - that use 18 Boeing 747 and 6 Boeing 737 airplanes due to sanctions and a decision by Bermuda's Civil Aviation Authority (BCAA) to terminate their safety certificates.
""The management of Volga Dnepr has made a conscious decision to find a possible solution together with partners and state regulators,"" it said.

Volga-Dnepr, which describes itself as the world leader in the oversize and heavy cargo market, continues to fly Russian-made aircraft including An-124 and Il-76 cargo jets. 
Russia has passed a law allowing the country's airlines to place aircraft leased from foreign companies on Russia's aircraft register - a manoeuvre likely to stoke Western fears of a mass default involving hundreds of jetliners.

(Reuters) - Wall Street is taking a gloomy view of  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) ahead of its quarterly results on Monday, as rising COVID-19 cases in China, the Russia-Ukraine crisis and lingering supply issues threaten to hit the sportswear giant's 2022 sales.
At least 10 brokerages have cut the stock's price targets this week on fears that a lift from strong sneaker demand in North America will be offset by persistent shortages, stemming from factory closures in top supplier Vietnam last year.
Nike's current quarter is also expected to take a hit from stalling shopping traffic in China due to rising COVID infections and the decision to temporarily shutter stores and online business in Russia, following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
""The recent rise in geopolitical uncertainty, increase in oil prices, and growing strength of the U.S. dollar present risk of slowing growth for Nike's international segments ahead,"" Jefferies analysts said.
THE CONTEXT
Earlier this month, Nike's main rival Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) Inc flagged a knock to sales from closing operations in Russia and COVID disruptions in Vietnam. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts cut their forecast for Nike's current-quarter revenue growth in Europe to 7% from 15%, largely due to an estimated 2% hit to total sales from the Russia exit.
Still, resilient demand despite higher prices and a pivot to selling more products directly to consumers are expected to ease the pressure of higher supply chain costs on Nike's margins. 
""There is still a lot of strength in the way that Nike is running its retail strategy, and in its product. Those two strategies are key for its future,"" said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.

624,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 11:50AM ET</span>","After key Russian bond payment, attention turns to next due dates","By Karin Strohecker and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has paid interest due on two sovereign dollar bonds, easing doubts about its willingness and ability to honour external debt after harsh sanctions imposed by the West, but a busy payment schedule ahead will keep investors on edge.
Failure to pay could have led to Russia's first external bond default in more than a century and was seen as a key test after the sanctions intended to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. 
On Friday, Russia's finance ministry said it had fully met its obligations. Sources involved in the multi-step process of the $117 million coupon payments also confirmed the funds were on their way to creditors.
Some European bond holders said they received funds due in U.S. dollars, while two creditors in Taiwan told Reuters the funds were in the process of being remitted.
""The payment on both coupons has been executed,"" one source familiar with the situation said. 
The coupons were due on Wednesday but Russia had a 30-day grace period for the payment, which must be received in full and in the right currency to avoid default.
News of the payment lifted Russian bond prices, with the 2043 bond, one of the issues on which a coupon had been due, rising to 45 cents in the dollar.
While trading volumes were thin, that marked a rise from a record low of 12 cents hit on March 8, Refinitiv data shows. 
Russia has around $40 billion of external bonds outstanding, half of which are held by foreign investors. It was not clear if domestic holders of the bonds, which include some of the country's biggest lenders, had received payments. 
However, this week's payments are the first of many Russia must make to preserve its complex web of external borrowing. 
It must pay another $615 million in coupons this month while on April 4, a hefty $2 billion bond must be repaid. In total, more than $4.5 billion in coupons and maturities are due by year-end. 
One complication is that Eurobonds placed after 2014 -- the year Russia first came under sanctions for annexing Crimea -- allow for payment in alternative currencies such as euros and pounds. 
And the next international coupon due March 21 is a $66 million payment on a 2029 dollar bond, which like others sold after 2018, lists the rouble as an alternative currency option. It too has a 30-day grace period.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analyst Jonny Goulden said upcoming payments may treat investors differently ""either because those bonds are cleared via the Russian NSD settlement mechanism or because they have a rouble fallback as a payment currency, which the Russian government may look to pay in roubles.""
POST-MAY 24 BONDS
But questions have arisen on what happens to Russian bonds maturing after May 24. 
The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued general license 9A on March 2, authorising U.S. persons to receive dividends and bond payments on Russian securities from the finance ministry, central bank or national wealth fund -- all of which are under sanctions. 
That exemption runs out on May 25, leaving in balance nearly $2 billion in external sovereign bond payments due until end-2022. 
Christopher Granville, managing director at TS Lombard reckons the flow of money will continue, with further OFAC exemptions likely. 

""It's safe to say it will be remain manually controlled, intermediaries will be able to apply for exemptions and if Russia allows payments, why would they want U.S. creditors to suffer?"" Granville said.
""Also the payments will hurt Russia by eating into their hard currency reserves.""

LONDON (Reuters) -British American Tobacco Plc is in advanced talks to transfer its Russian business to Russia's SNS Group of Companies, its distributor, SNS said, after Moscow suggested it could nationalise assets of foreign firms that left the country.
Many international firms with investments or operations in Russia have withdrawn since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and the West imposed sweeping sanctions.
BAT (LON:BATS), which makes Pall Mall and Rothman's cigarettes, controls just under 25% of the Russian tobacco market.
""The process of transferring the management of BAT business in Russia to SNS GC is well under way at remarkable speed,"" an SNS spokesperson told Reuters, adding that the handover details were being negotiated.
BAT declined to comment on Friday.
BAT said last week it was looking for parties interested in the transfer of its Russia business.
Chief Marketing Officer Kingsley Wheaton had said then that BAT's distributor could be interested in a transfer, adding that exiting the business or stopping sales or manufacturing would be seen as a criminal bankruptcy by Russia with legal consequences.
The SNS spokesperson said the level of production and the supply and distribution chain would be maintained with a transfer.
It was not immediately clear whether BAT would pull out completely, or whether it would still supply SNS with raw materials or manufacturing support.

SNS began working with BAT as a distributor in 1993, according to the SNS website.
A tobacco industry expert said the move by BAT had surprised those working with the company in Russia.

MILAN (Reuters) - The Ukraine conflict has prompted many international banks to review their presence in Russia, or swiftly embark on the arduous task of unwinding their businesses there.
Some banks have disclosed the maximum hit they could suffer in a worst-case scenario, but a more accurate estimate of the actual losses they are set to bear will require time.
Italian and French banks have the largest Russianexposure, representing just over $25 billion each at the end ofSeptember, followed by Austrian banks with $17.5 billion, Bank of International Settlements data shows.
U.S. bank exposure totals $14.7 billion, BIS data shows.

EUROPEAN BANKS

RAIFFEISEN BANK INTERNATIONAL (RBI) 
RBI has said it is considering a possible withdrawal from Russia, where it has operated since the collapse of the SovietUnion. Business there contributed almost a third of RBI's 2021 net profit of 1.5 billion euros.
RBI's Russian business holds 2.4 billion euros in capital, or 18% of consolidated equity. Russia's 10th-largest bank by assets, it employs around 9,000 staff.
RBI's overall Russian exposure totalled 22.85 billion euros at the end of last year, more than half relating to the corporate private sector.
It comprises 11.6 billion euros in customer loans (or 11.5% of group), more than 80% in roubles.
Cross-border exposure to Russia is only 1.6 billion euroswith no parent funding from Vienna. RBI also holds 2.2billion euros in loans to Ukrainian customers.* 
SOCIETE GENERALE
Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) had 18.6 billion euros of overall exposure to the country at end-2021 - or 1.7% of the group total. Its Russian unit Rosbank has around 200 branches and 12,000 staff, which rise to 15,000 for all group activities.
More than 80% of the exposure, or 15.4 billion euros, is held locally by Rosbank, with only 3.2 billion euros cross-border, including 600 million euros in off-balance sheet items.
The French bank, which started doing business in Russia in 1872, left in 1917 and returned in 1973, said its Russian activities in 2021 represented 2.7% of group net income.
SocGen calculated it would lose half a percentage point of its core capital ratio in an extreme scenario where its Russian business is confiscated.
Of SocGen's Russian exposure, 41% is to retail and 31% to corporates. Exposure to Russian sovereign entities stands at 3.7 billion euros.
*
UNICREDIT
Italy's second-biggest bank is evaluating exiting Russia, where it runs the country's 14th largest bank with 4,000 staff.
A full write-off of UniCredit's Russian business, including cross-border and derivatives exposure, would cost around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion), pushing the core capital ratio to around 13% from 15.03%.
UniCredit's cross-border exposure to Russian clients is 4.5 billion euros, net of guarantees. The direct exposure is 1.9 billion euros net of currency hedges.
It could also suffer an up to 1 billion euro loss on derivatives if the rouble's value fell to zero. 
UniCredit will still pay cash dividends for 2021 in a worst-case scenario, while a planned 2.6 billion euro share buyback hinges on core capital staying above 13%.
*
INTESA SANPAOLO
Italy's biggest bank is analysing its exposure to Russia and Ukraine which, net of guarantees, amounts to 5.1 billion euros in loans and 0.6 billion in off-balance sheet items. Some 200 million euros in loans are to sanctions-hit entities.
Intesa, which serves corporate clients in Russia with a staff of 980, is conducting a strategic review of its presence.
* 
CREDIT AGRICOLE
The French bank's exposure to Russia - both onshore and offshore - is 6.7 billion euros, or 0.6% of its commercial lending portfolio as of Dec. 31.
That includes 2.9 billion euros of offshore exposure to 15 large Russian corporates, notably producers and exporters of commodities. Fully-owned subsidiaries in Ukraine and Russia together hold 376 million euros in equity.
Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) is monitoring closely its Russia exposures, but ruled out any impact on 2021 dividends.

BNP PARIBAS
The French bank has unveiled a total exposure of around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to Russia and Ukraine, sticking to its previously announced 2025 financial targets. 
* 
ING 
The Dutch bank has 5.3 billion euros in loans to Russian customers, or 0.9% of its loan book. About 700 million euros are affected by new sanctions.
*
DEUTSCHE BANK
The German bank, which has said it would wind down its Russian business reversing its previous stance, had gross exposure to Russia of 2.9 billion euros at end-2021.
It comprises 1.4 billion euros of loan exposure (0.3% of its loan book) and 1.5 billion euros of contingent risks relating mostly to undrawn commitments. The loan exposure is 600 million euros net of guarantees and asset collateral.
*
COMMERZBANK
The German lender has reduced its exposure to Russia to 1.3 billion euros from 1.9 billion in recent weeks.
*
CREDIT SUISSE
The Swiss bank is reviewing its Russian operations after disclosing that roughly 4% of assets in its core wealth management business belong to Russian clients.
It had initially disclosed only a gross credit exposure of 1.57 billion Swiss francs ($1.7 billion) to Russia at end-2021, or 848 million net of hedges. 
*
UBS
Switzerland's biggest bank has said its direct exposure to Russia accounted for $634 million of its total emerging market exposure of $20.9 billion at end-2021.
*
U.S. BANKS
*
CITIGROUP
The most impacted among U.S. banks, Citi has Russia exposure of $9.8 billion. It could lose nearly half in a worst-case scenario, it has said, as it speeds up plans to withdraw.
The total comprises $8.2 billion in third-party exposures, and a further $1.6 billion outside of its Russian subsidiary.

The London-listed company's decision comes at a time when office landlords are slowly recovering following the COVID-19 pandemic, with businesses shifting to a permanent hybrid model in which employees split work between home and office.
""The shift from fixed workspace to flex is now irreversible and the business will continue to accelerate its growth adding a thousand locations in the next year alone,"" said Chief Executive Officer Mark Dixon at the international property conference MIPIM.
The owner of the Spaces and Regus brands has around 3,500 buildings in more than 120 countries and counts 83% of the Fortune 500 firms among its global customer base. IWG, however, did not provide net addition of its centres for the year, which also takes into account closures if any.

IWG's customers can get access to the firm's wide network of locations, with various plans available for clients to opt from, giving employees the much-needed flexibility on geographical terms as well.
The Switzerland-headquartered firm earlier this month said it would merge its digital assets with flexible workspace platform The Instant Group as office space providers benefit from the hybrid work trend.

European Union sanctions have restricted exports of dual-use goods since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. More sanctions have been imposed since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Bosch said in a statement it had no knowledge that any official investigation had started.
It earlier said it had suspended deliveries of truck components inside Russia and to Russian customers partly because of indications its products were being used for non-civilian purposes in violation of local contracts. 
The company, which has plants producing vehicle parts and other goods in Russia, said much of its business in Russia had been curtailed because of the Ukraine war.
""We examine the impact of the respective current sanctions lists very carefully and then implement them consistently and in every detail,"" the company said.
A spokesperson for the economy ministry said it did not comment on individual cases.
Der Spiegel's report follows one by broadcaster ARD this week that quoted Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba saying Ukraine had found Bosch parts in Russian military vehicles.
""We take the Ukrainian foreign minister's allegations very seriously and immediately initiated an intensive investigation,"" the company said, adding that any parts were not supplied directly to the manufacturer of the military vehicles.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Friday after hawkish-sounding comments from a senior Federal Reserve official, which added to concerns about a possible escalation of the war in Ukraine. 
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 166 points, or 0.5%, at 34,315 points. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were down in parallel. All three cash indices had made solid gains since the Fed raised U.S. interest rates on Wednesday, and are still set to end the week in positive territory. 
Fed Governor Christopher Waller told CNBC that the central bank may have to raise the fed funds target range by 50 basis points (rather than the expected 25) at one of its next meetings, owing to the strength of inflationary pressure in the U.S. economy. He said that only the geopolitical situation - meaning the war in Ukraine - had held it back this week from raising by more than 25 basis points.
""I really favor frontloading our rate hikes...Just do it rather than just promise it,"" Waller said.
Earlier, the outspokenly hawkish St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had said that the Fed may need to raise rates as high as 3% this year to rein in inflation, which is currently running at a 40-year high.
The barrage of Fed-speak is set to continue throughout the day, with appearances from governor Michelle Bowman, Richmond's Tom Barkin and Chicago's Charles Evans also due. 
Those comments come at the end of a week when hopes for a quick end to the Ukraine war, and a reversion to more normal circumstances in global commodity markets, have receded as Russia broadened its assault on Ukraine's cities and China continued to resist Western efforts to isolate President Vladimir Putin's regime. Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping began a call to discuss the war and other issues at 9 AM ET.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday said Biden would make clear that the U.S. will impose 'costs' on China if it supports Russia more actively, for example by shipping military aid to the country. The U.S. approved $800 million in military aid to Ukraine earlier this week, while the European Union also earmarked more funds to help Ukraine defend itself. 
Among early movers, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock fell 5.6% to test a 13-month low after the videogame retailer posted a surprise loss of nearly $150 million over the holiday quarter late on Thursday. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) stock fell 5.2% after it also posted - albeit less disappointing - results caused by the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19 over the winter, which left it short-staffed at times. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock outperformed, rising 0.8% after Reuters reported that it's in advanced talks to sell 100 of its 737 MAX 10 aircraft to Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), which would be a substantial morale-booster at a time when the investment case is still clouded by the post-pandemic outlook for air travel.
Children's fashion retailer  Kidpik  also continued to make gains in the wake of its announcement of a tie-up with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) earlier in the week. Kidpik (NASDAQ:PIK) stock rose another 44%. and has quadrupled this week.

Allowing ""parallel imports"" reflects how Russia's retail sector has been upended by Western economic sanctions and decisions by international firms like H&M and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) to restrict their activity in Russia.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) said its head had met the director of Russia's top online retailer Wildberries where legalising parallel imports was discussed. Both sides were confident the move would be positive for consumers and Russian businesses.
FAS said it had prepared draft regulations on parallel imports - sometimes also called ""grey imports"" - which were being discussed by the government.
""The FAS initiative allowing parallel imports will be an effective support measure. ... Small and medium-sized businesses will be allowed to legally import foreign goods without seeking additional permissions, and the consumer will get access to a wider assortment of goods of a high quality for reasonable prices,"" Wildberries general director Tatyana Bakalchuk said in a statement.

""This is especially important for socially-significant goods like medicines, foodstuffs and children's products,"" Bakalchuk added.
Russia's government has proposed a raft of support measures to try to buttress its economy in the face of Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict. Nevertheless the Kremlin faces its most severe economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.

LONDON (Reuters) - While the West's big investors have ditched Russia in recent weeks, one small group of armchair investors sees a bargain and is shrugging off any ethical qualms.
At a time when many in Britain are pouring cash into charities to support relief efforts in Ukraine after its invasion by Russia, others are looking to profit and offering tips to ""buy the dip"" on social media.
""For me it is a one (sic) in a lifetime chance to buy,"" said an investor about stock in Russia-focused steel and mining group Evraz on the Reddit website on March 4. 
Just six days later, Evraz's London-listed shares were suspended after its biggest shareholder Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK, meaning any investor who took a punt on the stock had that money frozen.
Despite the risks, Russia-focused investments have proved popular with retail investors even as the war has taken a heavy human toll.
Russia - which calls its actions a ""special operation"" - fired missiles at an airport near Lviv on Friday, a city where hundreds of thousands of refugees are sheltering far from Ukraine's battlefields.
Major investors have called Russia ""uninvestable"", but DIY investors - many of whom took up stock-picking during the ""stonks"" trading frenzy in the pandemic - have been undeterred.
London-listed stocks of Russia-focused companies - including Abramovich's Evraz and gold and silver producer Polymetal - have recently leapt into the most-bought stocks tables at several of Britain's largest investment platforms, according to a review of their websites by Reuters.
Evraz stock plummeted 67% prior to its suspension, and Polymetal is down more than 85% since Russia's invasion began on Feb. 24. 
""It's playing with fire and seems mad to me, but some people want to take aggressive bets. And that will never change,"" said Holly Mackay, founder and chief executive of personal finance website Boring Money.
Markets regulator the Financial Conduct Authority told Reuters it was monitoring the situation. 
""Investors should take care when investing in companies that may be impacted by the Russian invasion,"" the regulator said.
Evraz was one of the top five most bought stocks last week by customers on the AJ Bell, interactive investor (ii) and  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) platforms, prior to the stock's suspension. 
It was also the stock with the highest buy-to-sell ratio on the Freetrade platform. All four cater specifically to retail investors, non-professionals who trade securities through online platforms.
The UK has claimed in its sanctions that Evraz has helped provide financial support towards destabilising Ukraine and may have supplied steel used for the production of Russian tanks. Evraz denies the claims.
AJ Bell said Evraz holdings would remain in customer portfolios at the price it was suspended at, while ii said shares were being held until further information was available.
Polymetal was also one of the top 10 most bought stocks last week across the platforms reviewed by Reuters and was top of AJ Bell's list.
The company is not subject to UK sanctions and its shares are still trading, although the stock was deleted from indexes by FTSE Russell on Monday after many brokers refused to trade its shares.
Polymetal, which has eight gold and silver mines in Russia and makes most of its revenues in the country, has said the situation in Ukraine is ""horrifying and heartbreaking"", and has called for a peaceful resolution.
'MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS'
Retail investors have become a bigger force in the markets in the past couple of years as more platforms have offered commission-free trading and stock-pickers have become more vocal on social media.
Online platforms are the fastest-growing part of the consumer investment industry in Britain, with newcomers much more likely to be younger or first-time investors.
The platforms may need to consider providing more warnings or ethical filters as more established investors have done in the Ukraine crisis, Mackay said, though she cautioned against being too restrictive.
Regulators have in the past warned of risks to retail investors, particularly after the suspension of British property funds in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in 2016 and COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, and with the suspension and subsequent collapse of investor Neil Woodford's flagship fund in 2019.
Hargreaves Lansdown and AJ Bell said they primarily provided a platform for customers to make their own investment decisions taking into account their ethical beliefs.
""Our role is to help inform so that clients can make their own decisions,"" a spokesperson for Hargreaves Lansdown said, adding the company was ""horrified by this human tragedy"" and was working with regulators.
Freetrade said it was monitoring the situation, liaising with regulators, and communicating regularly with customers to educate them about the risks of investing in Russian-linked stocks.

ii, which was bought by investment giant Abrdn in December, said the Russia-linked trades were not representative of a typical investor, adding it was working on ethical filters for assets, though these were not Russia-specific.
""There will always be some who choose to lean on extreme volatility,"" a spokesperson for ii said. ""It has always been the case, and we are not here to judge.""

637,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 08:09AM ET</span>",Stock Traders Brace for $3.5 Trillion Triple Witching Event,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street traders are bracing for fresh equity-market fireworks Friday after another week of global turbulence.
In a quarterly event known as triple witching, roughly $3.5 trillion of single-stock and index-level options are set to expire, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). At the same time, more near-the-money options are maturing than at any time since 2019 -- suggesting a bevy of investors will actively trade around those positions.
And once again, this triple witching coincides with a rebalancing of benchmark indexes including the S&P 500 -- a combination that tends to spark single-day volumes that rank among the highest of the year. According to an estimate from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, the rebalance in the index alone could spur $33 billion of stock trades.
Friday’s session lands just as the S&P 500 regains its footing with a three-day jump, buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s optimism the economy can withstand rate hikes and China’s promise to bolster its financial markets. Futures contracts on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 dipped in early Friday trading.
In the telling of derivatives pros, the recent rally has been fueled by dealers covering short positions to balance exposures while demand for stock hedges is elevated.
Now as many contracts expire, the key question is whether investors will rebuild their holdings of protective puts amid growth concerns and the war in Ukraine -- or will they chase the market rebound with call contracts. 
“I’ve never seen an environment where you’ve had so many potential overhangs in the market that can not be controlled,” said David Wagner, a portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors. “We’ll see if people can see to redeploy their puts.”
The S&P 500 has climbed almost 6% over three sessions this week in the best rally since 2020, as the likes of Marko Kolanovic at JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) urge investors to go all-in.
Exploding derivatives volume has been a fixture of the post-pandemic market -- whipsawing underlying stocks in both directions, again and again. To strategists including Charlie McElligott at  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR), the recent advance in the S&P 500 has again been amplified by the hedging activity of market-makers. 
It’s a complicated process, but it works roughly like this: When a dealer sells a put option, it’s essentially taking a bet on the underlying asset to go up. To offset this unwanted directional risk, the market-maker typically sells some of the asset to maintain a neutral position. When the put options expire or get exercised, it will reverse those hedging moves -- potentially creating a tailwind for the asset. 
Another factor involving dealers is their current “short gamma” or “short delta” position that requires them to go with prevailing market trends: Buy stocks when they go up and sell when they fall. 
At the start of the week, their exposure on S&P 500 products sat at a level near the maximum “short gamma” relative to history, according to estimates by McElligott, a cross-asset strategist at Nomura. Three days later, that has turned into “zero gamma.” Along the way, dealers were forced to buy back stocks and close their short positions. 
With market sentiment weak and institutional-fund exposure to equities near mutliyear lows, caution in the derivatives market is everywhere. The 20-day average of the Cboe put-call ratio for equities, for example, hovers near a two-year high.  
“We see a general trend of continued risk aversion among investors, and expectations that the stock market remains volatile,” said Steve Sears, president at Options Solutions. “There are so many major events that could change the market’s tempo that hedging and patient fortitude appears to be the message from the options market.”
Options either far out of money or in the money receive less attention on Wall Street around expiration dates. Now with an unusually large number of S&P 500 contracts sitting close to the spot price this time round, trading activity on Friday looks set to be more frenetic than usual, according to Goldman strategist Rocky Fishman.
“The most interesting is options that are near the money, since as we approach expiration, there’s uncertainty about whether or not they end up in the money,” he said. “That uncertainty can lead investors to actively trade around those positions.” "

The bidders, which include investment firms Brookfield and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), have submitted unsolicited proposals in recent weeks valuing Vantage Towers at a premium to its current valuation of 15 billion euros ($16.57 billion), one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The offers are for a majority stake in Vantage Towers, the source said, adding that Vodafone was studying the proposals and had not taken any decision.
Shares in Vantage Towers jumped 11.4% to a record 33.59 euros at 0926 GMT on the Reuters news and were up 10.4% at 11 GMT.
Vodafone shares were up 1.4%, outperforming their peers in the telecoms sector which was broadly flat.
Vodafone, which listed Vantage Towers in Frankfurt in March 2021 and still owns 81% of the business, has been reluctant to engage in talks with financial investors as it seeks to clinch an industry merger for Vantage with either Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY)'s towers unit DFMG or Orange's Totem, two separate sources said, cautioning no deal was imminent.
Vodafone, Orange and Brookfield declined to comment while GIP was not immediately available for comment.
A spokesperson for Deutsche Telekom said the company was reviewing strategic options for its infrastructure business, without elaborating.
Vodafone faces pressure from Europe's largest activist fund Cevian Capital to simplify its portfolio, enhance its strategy in key markets and boost returns.
If it goes ahead, a deal for its towers business would align Vodafone's strategy with Cevian's demands to look into strategic opportunities for its tower assets.
Such a move would come after the London-listed company turned down an 11 billion euro approach for its Italian operations in February, while its ambitions to consolidate the Spanish market hit a snag in early March after Orange and MasMovil announced exclusive talks to combine their respective businesses in Spain.
Telecoms executives have repeatedly called for market consolidation to reduce competition and boost operators' profitability at a time they need cash to invest in the rollout of 5G mobile telecom infrastructure.
""LIKE-MINDED PLAYER""
Vodafone is now focusing on extracting value from its controlling stake in Vantage Towers, with boss Nick Read repeatedly mentioning Orange's Totem or Deutsche Telekom's tower assets as suitable candidates.
""The next stage (for Vantage) should be an industrial merger, bringing our towers with another large player, a like-minded player, a like-minded operator,"" Read told reporters last month, stressing his interest in exploring a combination with the infrastructure assets of either Orange or Deutsche Telekom.
He added that while Vodafone was open to cutting its stake in Vantage, there was ""plenty of room for us to monetize down while staying in co-control of that entity with that like-minded player.""
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Deutsche Telekom had kicked off an auction for its towers business with indicative bids expected in mid March.
One of the sources said that while Vodafone is closely monitoring Deutsche Telekom's towers sale, it is more likely to pursue a deal with Orange's Totem due to antitrust concerns in Germany.
This source ruled out a deal with financial investors, saying that at this stage only an industry tie-up was on the cards.
Burdened by heavy debt and huge costs, telecom towers have been the target of several big takeovers in the past few years.

Independent tower operators such as Spain's Cellnex and U.S.-based American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) are also on the lookout for infrastructure deals as they race to expand in Europe for the roll-out of next-generation 5G technology.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks closed higher in New York on Friday, with participants balancing the future path of the Ukraine war after a key phone call between the U.S. and Chinese Presidents.
President Joe Biden talked to his counterpart in China, Xi Jinping, for two hours Friday morning. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Biden planned to warn Xi that the U.S. will retaliate against China if its - so far only verbal - support of Russia morphs into something more substantial. U.S. officials claim that Russia asked China for military aid earlier, a request that is likely to have become more urgent, given the heavy losses of equipment that it has sustained due to surprisingly fierce Ukrainian resistance. 
The U.S. approved $800 million in military aid, including sophisticated drone weaponry, to Ukraine earlier this week.
Biden was expected to warn Xi against any efforts to weaken the economic sanctions that the West has imposed on Russia since its invasion three weeks ago. Biden will travel to Europe next week to attend a summit of NATO members.
By 4:19 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 274 points, or 0.8%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.1% and the Nasdaq was up 2%. All three indices had made solid back-to-back gains over the last two days in a relief rally that followed the Federal Reserve's first interest rate hike in three years.
However, there is little on the data calendar after a busy week for economic news, existing home sales for February being the sole indicator of note.
GameStop (NYSE:GME) reported a surprise loss for the holiday quarter after the bell on Thursday. Analysts had expected a profit of 85 cents a share. 
Porsche (OTC:POAHY) CEO Oliver Blume said it had been in talks with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) about possible projects. The news revived interest around Apple's long-awaited-but-never-confirmed foray into automobiles.
Elsewhere, the dollar pushed back toward a two-year high against the yen after the Bank of Japan warned of a possible hit to the Japanese economy from a war that could lead to higher raw material prices. BoJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda indicated that he wasn't concerned about the weakness of the yen, however.
Crude oil prices also continued to push higher amid fears that the war could drag on and even intensify. The U.S. warned Russia against using chemical weapons, a move that some analysts see as possible, given the struggles of Russia's conventional forces. U.S. crude futures were up 1.8% at $104.81 a barrel, while Brent was up 1.1% at $107.84 a barrel.
Gold futures were down 1.2% at $1,919 an ounce.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 07:16AM ET</span>","Exclusive-U.S. fund says Japan's Shimizu should halt bid, says unfair to minority shareholders","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - A U.S.-based fund has called for Japan's Shimizu Corp to halt a $190 million bid to take control of road builder Nippon Road Co Ltd, saying the deal would be unfair to minority shareholders and go against governance reform.
In a letter to Nippon Road's board this week that was seen by Reuters, Kaname Capital objected to Shimizu's bid to double its holding to 50.1%.
Kaname, which owns 1.8% of Nippon Road, said the deal would put minority shareholders at a disadvantage by turning them into investors in a listed subsidiary.
""A partial bid is unsatisfactory. Only a 100% bid allows for fair and equal treatment of all shareholders,"" the Boston-based long-only fund said in its letter. 
The offer price of 10,000 yen ($84.13) a share was too low given Nippon Road's cash on hand, shareholdings and other assets, Kaname said, putting the share value closer to 12,500 yen. 
The offer by Shimizu, one of Japan's top construction firms, left minority shareholders with ""a poor choice"" of either hurrying to accept a low price or getting stuck with the reduced valuation and trading liquidity of a listed subsidiary, the $250 million Japan-focused fund said.
Shimizu declined to comment. No one was immediately available for comment at Nippon Road.
Both the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Japanese government have pushed for a reduction in the number of so called ""parent-child listings"", where subsidiaries of large listed companies are also listed.
Critics say the practice can lead to laxer governance and ultimately lower valuations, as the parent's controlling stake weakens the voting power of minority shareholders.
Shimizu's tender offer is set to close on Tuesday. Its offer of 10,000 yen represents a roughly 20% premium to Nippon Road's closing price just before the deal was announced.
Shares of the company closed not far off the offer price at 9,790 yen on Friday. Still, the company is trading at less than its book value, according to Refinitiv data, meaning it is worth less than its assets.
Japan had 248 listed subsidiaries as of March last year, down more than 40% from the peak of 417 in 2007, according to Nomura Institute of Capital Markets Research. 
Governance rules have discouraged such listings, citing an inherent conflict of interest.
The Tokyo bourse is also introducing stricter rules for liquidity in April, its biggest overhaul of its equity market in a decade. That will make it tougher for firms largely owned by parent companies or business partners.
Some industrial conglomerates are selling off group companies to eliminate parent-child listings. Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd, for example, sold or took control of more than a dozen subsidiaries in recent years, including Hitachi Chemical and Hitachi High-Technologies.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 07:07AM ET</span>",China to address market concerns about offshore listing rules - regulator quoted,"By Selena Li and Samuel Shen
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese authorities will address the concerns of international investors when finalising new rules for offshore listings, two sources quoted a senior regulatory official as telling a lobby group for foreign financial firms.
Western banks have been rattled by proposed rules for overseas listings announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) last December that they see as cumbersome. There is also no clarity on whether there will be a single point of regulatory contact for mainland companies wanting to list overseas or in Hong Kong.
Given concerns in the market, ""we definitely need a very clear direction of action,"" Shen Bin, the director-general of the CSRC's international department told a virtual meeting of the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) on Thursday, according to the sources.
Shen added that there was a very strong consensus among different authorities in China about supporting capital markets, the sources said. 
His comments come on the heels of remarks from Chinese Vice Premier Liu He who on Wednesday gave assurances that China would pursue market-friendly policies and said caution was needed about the introduction of measures that risked hurting markets.
Liu's remarks, which also touched upon Beijing's efforts to reach an agreement on a thorny bilateral dispute over audits of U.S.-listed Chinese firms, spurred huge rallies in the stocks of Chinese firms with overseas listings.
The CSRC did not immediately comment. ASIFMA, which counts 52 global banks and other financial institutions among its members, declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to discuss the meeting.
The CSRC's proposed rules included a requirement that banks which manage a Chinese firm's offshore listing register with the regulator. That fanned concerns about an increase in compliance burdens and other regulatory risks, and there were also concerns that companies could be subject to multiple regulatory checks.
In feedback to the CSRC on the draft rules, ASIFMA had said the proposed guidelines would ""greatly impact the willingness of offshore securities companies and professionals to participate in Chinese companies' offshore listings"".
Further muddying the situation, the Cyberspace Administration of China in January also announced rules requiring a security review of all platform companies with data of more than 1 million users before they list overseas.

The comments from Liu and Shen come amid a murkier outlook for the world's second-largest economy. Investors are fretting about blowback from Beijing's dealings with sanctions-hit Russia, uncertainty in global demand, the impact of a broad regulatory crackdown and a recent spike in domestic COVID-19 cases.
Shen did not say if there would be significant revisions to the CSRC rules or when they would be finalised and published.

U.S. investors exited bond funds for a 10th consecutive week, selling $7.24 billion worth, compared with net selling of $7.8 billion in the previous week, Refinitiv Lipper data showed.

The Fed announced a quarter of a percentage point increase to near-zero U.S. interest rates on Wednesday, and signalled it would hike rates more aggressively than expected to tame soaring inflation, following a firm inflation reading last week.
U.S. taxable bond funds lost $5.18 billion in a second consecutive week of net selling, while municipal bond funds saw a fifth weekly outflow, worth $2.04 billion.
Investors sold U.S. high yield funds to the turn of $1.86 billion and pulled $3.8 billion out of U.S. short/intermediate investment-grade funds, marking a 10th weekly outflow in a row.

Meanwhile, investors turned net sellers in U.S. equity funds, offloading funds worth $2.81 billion, compared with purchases of $4.57 billion in the preceding week.
U.S. value funds, however, drew purchases of $1.41 billion after two straight weeks of outflows, but growth funds saw a sixth weekly outflow worth $2.61 billion.

Water reserves for the region are being completely exhausted, Wasserverband Strausberg-Erkner, said in a statement Thursday following a meeting on the Tesla project. WSE said further commercial and industrial development plans aren’t possible without additional extraction permits due to the lack of groundwater extraction.
Concern about Tesla’s plant straining the area’s water supply is one of the main reasons the carmaker will start producing Model Y electric vehicles months later than Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk planned. The economy minister for the state of Brandenburg, where Tesla has constructed the facility, has said that while there was enough water for the first stage of the factory, more will be needed as Tesla expands.
Tesla secured approval for the project early this month and said it expected to obtain an operating license within a matter of weeks. The company has sent out invitations to a delivery day event at the factory on March 22.

647,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 06:21AM ET</span>",How a Columbia professor became the scourge of activist short sellers,"By Chris Prentice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - You may not have heard of Joshua Mitts, a young Columbia University professor who is making some powerful enemies on Wall Street.
The 36-year-old securities law specialist has become an increasingly influential figure in the hot debate over activist short selling since publishing a 2018 analysis of trading data that suggested some players were manipulating the market.
Interviews with 12 people familiar with his work and career, including Mitts himself and some of his toughest critics, shed light on how an academic little known outside his field just a few years ago has since taken center stage in the ugly feud between short sellers and the companies they target.
That struggle has sparked a sprawling probe by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into suspected trading manipulation by short sellers and hedge funds.
Activist short sellers like Muddy Waters (NYSE:WAT)' Carson Block bet against public companies they deem over-valued and then publish their investment thesis. They say their work aids market efficiency and dispute Mitts' analysis as flawed.
Nonetheless the interviews, which detail Mitts' contacts with U.S. authorities, show the professor and his work have played a significant role in the federal probes. 
""One reason the work really resonated was it took a large sample and showed there was evidence for what companies were saying: that there was potential abuse,"" said Peter Molk, a law professor at the University of Florida. 
Mitts declined to comment on his work for the Justice Department beyond pointing to a statement on his resume that he has ""extensive experience supporting"" the agency. He defended his research and said he wanted to be objective and is not opposed to short selling.
""Not only is short selling not illegal, it's important to have bears,"" he said.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the SEC, the main stock market regulator, declined to comment. 
Mitts' journey began in August 2018 when he reached out to real-estate company Farmland (NYSE:FPI) Partners Inc, which was grappling with a steep fall in its shares after an anonymous online post raised questions about its solvency.
Weeks earlier, he had published his analysis of 1,720 pseudonymous posts attacking publicly listed stocks on financial website Seeking Alpha between 2010 and 2017. His study found such posts were preceded by unusual and suspicious trading through stock options, in a process he called ""short and distort"".
Prior to 2018, the battle between U.S. companies and their detractors focused largely on the merits of short sellers and the veracity of their claims. Mitts' work gave companies new ammunition: they could use data to point to potentially manipulative trading tricks and allege fraud. 
'ON A SILVER PLATTER' 
Mitts spoke with Farmland executives about his work and Farmland then retained him as an expert in late August 2018, the company said. Mitts' analysis showed investors bought put options https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-stocks-shorts-insight-idINKCN1R20AW with a short expiration window ahead of a Seeking Alpha posting. They became profitable once Farmland's shares began to tumble, and subsequently ginned up additional selling interest.
Put options are derivative contracts that give holders the right to sell the underlying stock at a set price.
Short-selling graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2HyuFCE
In early September, Farmland CEO Paul Pittman and the company's attorneys took the professor to meet with officials at the SEC's Denver office, where they rebutted the short seller's claims and laid out the short and distort arguments.
Pittman and the attorneys subsequently met officials at the Justice Department in October, without Mitts, and again laid out their rebuttal and manipulation theories, Farmland said.
""This is not about shorting. This is about securities fraud,"" CEO Pittman told Reuters. 
Elisabeth de Fontenay, a law professor at Duke University, said scrutinizing such types of trading patterns would have been a no-brainer for U.S. prosecutors.
""Josh Mitts handed them some potential indicators of fraud on a silver platter. Once they get handed that, they are going to look into it,"" she said.
Mitts had more corporate callers. 
After Farmland, several other companies trying to repel short sellers hired him to consult, including  Banc of California  (NYSE:BANC) Inc, Burford Capital Ltd and  Neovasc  (NASDAQ:NVCN) Inc, according to court and regulatory filings. 
Banc of California and Neovasc did not respond to requests for comment. Burford Capital did not provide a comment for this story. 
In 2019, Mitts began working as a consultant for the Justice Department, according to one source familiar with the matter who declined to be named because such work is sensitive. 
SHORT SELLERS HIT BACK 
Reuters and other media outlets have reported that the Justice Department had launched an expansive criminal investigation into the relationships among hedge funds and firms that publish negative reports on certain companies, often with the aim of sending the stock lower. 
The department has issued subpoenas to dozens of companies, which included requests for funds' trading records, according to the reports, bringing the issue of short selling to the forefront of market attention.
The debate over the practice has long raged, with activist short sellers saying they act as whistleblowers rooting out fraud or other corporate misconduct, and critics saying they often spread false or misleading information.
Spreading false information with the intent to move a stock price could constitute market manipulation, but U.S. free speech protections mean the bar for bringing such cases is high. 
Mitts said the aim of his research is simply to shed more light on short selling. 
""My goal is to better understand how short reports affect the markets. I appreciate when industry participants take the time to engage with academics on these important questions."" 
Yet his critics are angry, including big-name investors Block of Muddy Waters and Citron Research's Andrew Left, both of whom are being scrutinized as part of the Justice Department probe, according to the media reports.
Left said Mitts' analysis was fundamentally flawed because it did not account for all the potential reasons behind trading patterns that may appear to be suspicious, describing the study as ""sloppy"".
Block, who made his name outing fraud at Chinese companies, first learned about Mitts in January 2019 when the law professor was quoted in a news report about regulators looking into aggressive short sellers, a source with direct knowledge of the situation said. 
Initial interactions between the two men were friendly. Block attended Mitts' class at Columbia in early 2019. That April, during a public panel discussion featuring the two men, Mitts told the moderator that he thought ""Carson's a good American.""
But the relationship has soured. 
Last month, Block published a paper, ""Distorting the Shorts,"" refuting Mitts' paper, in which he said the academic's work consulting for companies was a conflict of interest. 
Mitts told Reuters he stopped consulting work for targets of activist short sellers in April 2020.
Block also argued that Mitts' analysis was misleading as the authors of the majority of posts Mitts reviewed were not actually short the stock concerned, according to disclosures required by Seeking Alpha. Trading patterns Mitts cites as key evidence of manipulation may be accounted for by corporate earnings reports rather than short reports, the paper said. 

""Mitts' 'Short and Distort' badly misrepresents the underlying data,"" it added. 
Mitts declined to comment on Block's paper.

648,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 06:18AM ET</span>",Boeing in talks for landmark Delta MAX order - sources,"By Eric M. Johnson, David Shepardson and Rajesh Kumar Singh
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is edging towards a landmark order from Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) for up to 100 of its 737 MAX 10 jets, a model it is battling in separate talks to get approved before year-end rule changes, people familiar with the matter said.
The deal, if confirmed, would be the first order from Delta for Boeing's best-selling single-aisle airplane family, and the first major Boeing order for the carrier in a decade. 
It comes as Delta - the only major U.S. carrier without a 737 MAX on order - reshapes its fleet in anticipation of a swift recovery from the pandemic.
Boeing and Delta, which have had a frayed relationship in past years, are working on details of an order that could consist of 100 aircraft, many or all of which could involve the largest variant, the 737 MAX 10, two of the people said.
If a deal is reached, an announcement could come as soon as next month, one of the people added. 
Boeing and Delta declined to comment. 
Industry sources cautioned negotiations typically go down to the wire and no final decision had been taken. There has been speculation about a MAX order from Delta in the past, without a deal coming to fruition.
The MAX 10 competes with Airbus' strongest-selling model, the A321neo. Both planes are aimed at the fast-growing segment of the market just above 200 seats. 
The A321neo, which leasing company Air Lease (NYSE:AL) described on Wednesday as the ""hottest airplanes in the market"", has a commanding lead in sales, but Boeing has scored a series of contract wins in the past year.
Airbus also declined to comment. 
In September, Airline Weekly quoted Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian as saying there was a place for the MAX at Delta if the carrier could figure out how to bring them in.
Asked about the MAX in London earlier this month, he told reporters Delta was always looking at all airplane models.
CERTIFICATION TALKS 
For Boeing, which is entrenched in broader certification and industrial headaches, the deal would cement a major new customer for its cash-cow narrowbody.
The planemaker is facing a separate but increasingly high-stakes battle to win certification of the MAX 10 before a new safety standard on cockpit alerts takes effect at year-end.
The deadline for changes was introduced as part of broader regulatory reforms at the Federal Aviation Administration following fatal crashes of a smaller MAX model in 2018 and 2019.
Boeing has held talks with some lawmakers about the potential of asking for more time, but has not formally sought an extension to address a flight deck issue, the people said.
Asked about the possibility, an FAA spokesperson said, ""safety dictates the timeline of certification projects"".
Only Congress can extend the deadline if the FAA does not certify the MAX before end-year.
Boeing has raised with some lawmakers the potential impact on jobs and production if the 737 MAX 10 is not approved, the people said. 
""We continue to work transparently with the FAA to provide the information they need, and we are committed to meeting their expectations to achieve 737-10 certification,” Boeing said in an emailed statement.
It did not comment directly on any talks with lawmakers but said the jet would support ""tens of thousands of jobs at Boeing and across our supply chain, including in Washington state"". 
The issue is also likely to get entangled in the confirmation hearings of the next FAA administrator. Current FAA Administrator Steve Dickson is set to step down March 31. 

The Seattle Times this month cited an earlier Boeing submission to the FAA citing an estimated cost of full compliance for the MAX at ""more than $10 billion"".

(Reuters) -Sycamore Partners is in the early stage of making a possible cash offer for fashion retailer Ted Baker, the private equity firm said on Friday, in the latest sign of strong U.S. interest in taking over British entities. 
New York-based Sycamore, which specialises in deals in the struggling retail sector, has until April 15 to make a firm offer for the London-listed Ted Baker. Sycamore said there was no certainty an offer would be made and did not disclose what the terms might be for any deal. 
Ted Baker said it has not received an offer but would evaluate any proposal, although it was confident in its independent prospects.
Shares of the upmarket retailer jumped 20% on Friday but were still trading just above a pound each, compared with the nearly 30 pounds it was worth in 2015, giving it a current market valuation of nearly 220 million pounds ($289.26 million), Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
Takeover interest in British companies, ranging from defence groups to a leading supermarket, is its highest in years, as the pandemic and uncertainties linked to Britain's departure from the European Union have reduced valuations. 
Ted Baker is in the middle of three-year turnaround plan under boss Rachel Osborne as it tries to boost its online presence and rebuild its image after profit warnings and accounting issues.
Osborne took charge in 2019 in a management reshuffle that included the exit of former chief executive Ray Kelvin following allegations of inappropriate behaviour. Kelvin has denied the allegations and retains a nearly 12% stake in the company he founded in 1988 in Glasgow. 

Ted Baker, which has nearly 400 locations mostly in Europe, North America and the United Kingdom, said in February it was ""cautiously optimistic"" about outlook for the current year as people slowly return to working in offices.

The property developer said last September it had settled the coupon payment of the 4 billion yuan ($629 million) Shenzhen-traded bond due Sept 23 2025 via negotiations with bondholders, without giving details.
In a filing dated Thursday, Hengda said it would hold meeting with creditors of the 2025 bond on March 18-19 to approve the payment of interests incurred between Sept 2020 to Sept 2021 to be made on Sept 2023.
Struggling with more than $300 billion in liabilities, Evergrande has so far avoided technical bond defaults onshore, though it has missed payments on some offshore bonds.
While it has yet to start negotiations with offshore creditors on debt restructuring, it has tried to seek more time from onshore bondholders for coupon and redemption payments to avoid a technical default.

In January, it secured approval from onshore bondholders to delay by six months payments on a puttable bond  worth 4.5 billion yuan.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese manufacturers began restarting production at plants in the country's quake-hit northeast, but  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said it plans to idle 18 assembly lines for a few days next week due to a shortage of parts from suppliers.
On one hand, the limited damage caused by the magnitude 7.4 temblor has highlighted Japan's success in building resilience against the frequent tremors that shake the archipelago.
But the quake has sparked concerns of further disruptions to a pandemic-hit supply chain for precision components vital to electronics and autos production and in which Japanese manufacturers play a leading role.
Toyota, the world's largest automaker by sales volume, said it will idle the 18 lines at 11 domestic factories, mostly for three days.
It had suspended operations at three factories due to the quake and sees lost production of 20,000 units due to the stoppages. Toyota has already cut its global production target due to the ongoing chip shortage.
Murata Manufacturing Co (OTC:MRAAY) Ltd, the top global supplier of ceramic capacitors used in smartphones and cars, said it restarted production on Friday at two stopped plants with the remaining two idled plants to restart next week. 
A fire that broke out at a factory which produces chip inductors caused some damage to equipment. 
Renesas Electronics Corp, which makes nearly a third of the microcontroller chips used in cars globally, said it has restarted production after stopping it at two factories with a partial stop at a third. 
All three factories, including the Naka factory where fire broke out last year, are expected to return to pre-quake capacity by Wednesday, Renesas said. 
Power has mostly been restored across the northeast, which suffered Japan's biggest earthquake 11 years ago. Areas of Tokyo lost power for nearly three hours after the latest quake, in which three people died and 183 were injured. 
The blackout has forced the disposal of some COVID-19 vaccines held in cool storage, the Yomiuri newspaper reported.

Tech conglomerate  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group Corp is in the process of gradually restarting production at three factories in the quake-hit area, a spokesperson said. 
There is some damage to a facility in Shiroishi, Miyagi prefecture which produces laser diodes but the impact on production is limited, Sony said.

Unprecedented Western sanctions have hit the heart of Russia's financial system over events in Ukraine and Sberbank was among the companies targeted. The bank quit almost all its European markets earlier this month.
""Due to sanctions, from March 18, the list of currencies available for transfers to other banks in Russia and abroad has been restricted,"" Sberbank said on its Telegram channel. 
""This means that Sberbank will not be able to make transfers to other banks in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, Danish crowns and Swedish krona.""
Transfers of some currencies, including roubles, euros, Japanese yen and Swiss francs, remain possible at Sberbank branches. 
Several Russian banks have been banned from the SWIFT international payments network, hampering their efforts to move money outside of Russia, but operations within the country have remained largely unscathed until now. 

Moscow and Beijing are working to establish cooperation between their respective financial messaging systems. Russia's SWIFT alternative, the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS), should enable the flow of domestic interbank traffic.
Russia's second-largest state lender VTB said on Thursday it would hand over servicing of foreign securities to other Russian financial companies, to allow investors to buy and sell assets without limitations.

More than 80% of newly sold Porsche vehicles will be fully-electric in 2030, Porsche AG Chief Executive Oliver Blume said at the group's annual press conference.
That target previously applied to Porsche's electrified models overall, which also includes plug-in hybrids.
Porsche AG also stuck to its long-term target of an operating margin of at least 15%, finance chief Lutz Meschke said.

Volkswagen and its top shareholder Porsche SE struck a framework agreement for a potential partial listing of Porsche AG, which could value the division at up to 90 billion euros.
Such a listing would include listing up to 25% of Porsche AG's preferred stock, selling 25% plus 1 ordinary share in the carmaker to Porsche SE and paying out 49% of IPO proceeds to Volkswagen's shareholders as a special dividend.

658,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 04:24AM ET</span>",European Stocks Open Mostly Lower; Biden-Xi Call Awaited,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- European stock markets opened slightly lower on Friday but were still on course for a weekly gain, as participants awaited the outcome of key talks between U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping.
By 4:20 AM ET (0820 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was down 6 points, or 0.2% while the broader-based Stoxx 600 was flat. The best performing major index was the FTSE MIB in Italy, while France's CAC 40 underperformed with a 0.4% drop, a day after President Emmanuel Macron warned that the state may have to nationalize ""certain energy companies"" - a comment taken to refer to Electricite de France (PA:EDF).
Stocks look likely to finish the week higher; thanks to the ongoing diplomacy that has accompanied Russia's war in Ukraine, which has seen the two sides' positions inch closer to each other since last weekend. However, on the ground, the campaign remains as destructive as ever, with Russian rockets striking the city of Lviv in western Ukraine overnight.
A vital part of that diplomatic process - despite its location on the other side of the world - is China, whose political support for Russia has cushioned the impact of the West's economic sanctions on the country. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned on Thursday that “China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia’s aggression and we will not hesitate to impose costs.”
Foreign exchange markets were broadly stable although the dollar pushed back toward a six-year high against the yen after the Bank of Japan warned of negative impacts to the Japanese economy from the Ukraine war, largely through the channel of higher raw material costs. That follows similar warnings from the European Central Bank and Bank of England this week. The BoE hiked its key rate for a third straight meeting to 0.75% on Thursday, but sterling weakened as the Bank's warning about war impacts put a greater emphasis on the downside risk to growth than on the upside risk to prices. As such, traders scaled back their bets on the BoE, keeping step with the Fed as it tightens policy throughout 2022.
By 4:20 AM ET, the euro was down 0.1% at $1.1077 while the pound was up 0.1% at $1.3153. The dollar was also trading at 118.90 yen, up 0.3% on the day.
A busy week for central banks comes to an end later with the Central Bank of Russia's policy meeting. The pressure on the ruble has eased off in recent days, but it has still lost one-third of its value since the invasion. President Vladimir Putin proposed a new term for Governor Elvira Nabiullina on Thursday, days after rumors swirled about her unsuccessfully offering her resignation.
Among early movers, Danish shipping giant Maersk (CSE:MAERSKb) rose 0.4% after it warned that China's string of COVID-19 outbreaks could revive disruptions to global supply chains, while Dutch-listed  Prosus  (AS:PRX), which holds Naspers' strategic stake in Chinese Internet giant Tencent, rose 2.3% as sentiment toward Chinese stocks continued to improve gradually."
659,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 04:12AM ET</span>",Retreat from Russia riddled with risks for Western banks,"By Sinead Cruise and Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - As they switch off the lights in Moscow, the world's top banks face a risk-ridden retreat, juggling obligations to anxious clients and staff while complying with sanctions that have rewritten the rules of doing business in Russia.
There is a growing realisation that these sanctions are likely to remain long-term, industry sources told Reuters, which means strategic not just tactical decisions are needed as executives look to protect hard-won improvements to their credibility since the global financial crisis.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) have committed to helping clients with the complex task of unwinding their Russian operations, whilst at the same time supporting the relocation of staff who wish to leave.
""(President Vladimir) Putin has fewer and fewer ways to hit back, he's in a corner and these people could end up as pawns,"" one senior compliance executive at a large U.S. bank said of the effects of Western sanctions on Russia.
But the sweeping scope of these sanctions mean banks will need more rather than less manpower in order to ramp up client screening and avoid potentially costly financial penalties for any violations.
In a sign of both the immediate strain and the prospect of sustained pressures, alerts about potentially problematic transactions at one institution rose by 50-60% on the first day sanctions were introduced, one source told Reuters.
""That must suggest that their operational teams are at least 50-60% smaller than they need to be at this time, so that is definitely a concern,"" one of the sources said.
While Citi, JPMorgan and Goldman have all closed their doors to new business in Russia, they have declined to comment on whether they might surrender their potentially lucrative Russian banking licenses in the longer term.
Around half of the 80 Goldman employees in Moscow have moved or are relocating to Dubai, three sources familiar with the matter said, but the Wall Street firm's Russia head is remaining in the Russian capital, one source said.
JPMorgan has around 160 staff in Moscow, where it has been for 50 years, and a large percentage are Russian nationals who will remain, another source familiar with the matter said.
Citi, which had put its consumer business in Russia up for sale before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is also mothballing its institutional and wealth management businesses.
Citi, Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment.
RELATIONSHIPS
Citi and JPMorgan face some of the biggest headaches as they act as custodians for many Western firms trading assets in Russia, where the stock exchange has been shut since Feb. 25.
This role involves particular legal obligations, including the safeguarding, clearing and settling of transactions, the duration of which can vary from hours to years.
Asset management firms such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and PIMCO will be relying on banks to help mitigate losses on tens of billions of dollars of Russian holdings when trading resumes.
But this assumes they are able to obtain the necessary permits and can find others willing to buy.
Moscow has set out strict new terms foreign investors must meet if they wish to buy or sell Russian assets. These include providing data on beneficial owners and setting out ""the purpose, subject, content and essential conditions of the transaction"" in Russian. 
While divesting to sanctioned entities may be permitted if banks and investors can obtain special licences from authorities such as the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, it is unclear how long applications might take, experts said.
There is also a lack of clarity on whether Western lenders may need further dispensations to repatriate earnings from managing those disposals, or proceeds from sales of their own assets, particularly if the buyers are subject to sanctions.
France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) has even warned of the possibility that Russia could confiscate its bank assets, including a 99.97% stake in Rosbank.
And the European Union has barred settlement systems in the bloc from completing stock, bond or derivatives transactions in roubles, the only currency many Russian firms could pay in.
Banks have just weeks to close out outstanding contracts such as derivatives with sanctioned Russian customers, and painstakingly ensure each remaining transaction with non-sanctioned customers does not breach the curbs indirectly.
""The impact and required actions will depend on their individual circumstances,"" the International Swaps and Derivatives Association said of its members.
'DISENTANGLING'
Sanctions mean that some of the key prerequisites to engaging in overseas trading, capital raising or advisory work are no longer easily accessible, including market data and ratings services for sovereign and corporate debt or equity.
Without these, banks cannot easily judge the value or creditworthiness of an asset or accurately assess how much risk capital they need to hold to comply with their own domestic regulatory requirements.
Italy's UniCredit has said it may need to write off 7.4 billion euros in a worst-case winding down of its Russian business, while CEO Andrea Orcel warned that ""disentangling"" from the country was a huge task.
Moody's (NYSE:MCO), Fitch and S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) have slashed their scores on Russia by several notches since the war with Ukraine began, putting the sovereign deep into ""junk"" territory.
Further downgrades are also likely, as the government battles to avoid defaulting on its first international debt repayments since the Bolshevik revolution.
The London Stock Exchange last week suspended all products and services for all customers in Russia, days after suspending news and commentary distribution. 
And the Big Four accounting firms have also severed ties, making it harder for banks to get their businesses audited in line with internationally accepted practice.
A public backlash over Russia's invasion, which Moscow describes as a ""special operation"" is also cause for concern.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) abruptly changed course after stinging criticism from some investors and politicians, after initially saying it planned to maintain ties with Russia.
And Austria's Raiffeisen, one of the European banks most exposed to Russia, said it was studying a possible withdrawal after earlier saying it had no plans to.

For Pushan Dutt, INSEAD Professor of Economics, a shift in global geopolitics will put banks at heightened risk of Russian-related legal and regulatory trouble for decades to come.
""Absent a regime change, Russia will remain cut off from the international banking system,"" Dutt said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Aquila Acquisition Corp shares slipped on Friday in the first special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listing in Hong Kong as the city's bourse talked up what it calls ""a new route to market"".
The stock declined to HK$9.70 on its first day of trading, down 3% from the offer price of HK$10 each with only one live trade during the session. There were two further cross trades, Refinitiv data showed.
Hong Kong regulators gave the green light for SPAC listings in January and a further nine SPACs have since lodged filings to follow Aquila's debut, in which it raised just under $130 million.
But amid restrictions on retail investors and what market watchers called unfamiliarity with SPACs, Aquila shares had a muted day.
Professional investors are allowed to trade the shares but need to prove to their brokers they meet criteria put in place by regulators to restrict buying and selling SPAC shares.
Market participants said Hong Kong hoped to attract investors from mainland China to list SPACs, firms that raise cash to buy private firms, taking them public without a traditional initial public offering (IPO).
The deals come after Singapore became the first major market in Asia to allow SPACs to trade in the wake of a surge in 'blank cheque' firms listing in the United States. But a number of those U.S. firms are now trading under water, tempering the appetite of global investors for such deals.
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) welcomed the SPAC listing on the exchange's main board.
""It adds a new route to market for issuers (and) further diversifies our listing offering,"" HKEX Chief Executive Officer Nicolas Aguzin said in a statement.
Aquila said in filings it raised HK$1 billion ($128 million) by selling 100 million Class A shares at HK$10 each, in an offering that also included 50.03 million warrants. It said it intends to look for deals among companies in new economy sectors such as green energy.
A total of 99 investors bought into the Aquila SPAC, the filings show, with 40 of those considered professional institutional investors.
""It is new in the market and is only a shell,"" said Steven Leung, sales director at UOB Kay Hian, as the shares failed to trade. 
""It may take a while for investors to get used to it and until sentiment for SPACs heat up again. And there are restrictions for retail investors, they cannot simply jump into it like other stocks.""
Retail shareholders are restricted from buying the SPAC stock until the company makes an acquisition, which reduces the number of investors who can trade the shares.

Meanwhile Chinese investment banks regulated by the China Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) have been barred from being SPAC promoters in Hong Kong, Reuters reported last week.

(Reuters) - Hong Kong startup Greater Bay Airlines has scaled back its initial growth ambitions due to tight pandemic-related quarantine restrictions and has yet to set a date for its first commercial flights, its chief executive said on Friday.
The carrier, which intends to compete against the financial centre's dominant airline, Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) Ltd, was granted a licence last month to operate regular flights. 
The second of three Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-800s leased from China's ICBC Leasing arrived in Hong Kong on Wednesday.
However, Chief Executive Algernon Yau said requirements for two weeks of hotel quarantine on arrival to the city would need to relax before Greater Bay would commit to a launch date and its first routes.
""I think we would need around three months in advance,"" he said in a phone interview of the notice needed to gain traffic rights and airport slots. 
The airline said in October it hoped to have seven jets in operation by the end of 2022, but Yau said growth plans had been scaled back due to setbacks in border openings as COVID-19 cases rose in its home city.
""I think we will operate three aircraft this year,"" he said. ""And maybe we will reach the level in the second half of 2023 where we are adding two more aircraft.""
The carrier is developing a longer-term growth plan that could involve a fleet of up to 30 Boeing 737 MAX 10 or Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A321neo planes flying to destinations in mainland China and around Asia over the next five years, Yau said. 

Greater Bay has not yet decided if it will source the planes directly from manufacturers or from lessors or a mix of the two, he added.
The airline will have all economy class seats and a mid-market model similar to Virgin Australia and JetBlue, Yau said, positioning it between full-service Cathay Pacific and that airline's budget offshoot Hong Kong Express.

664,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2022 02:46AM ET</span>",Moderna seeks FDA authorization for second COVID booster for all adults,"By Akriti Sharma
(Reuters) -Moderna Inc on late Thursday sought emergency use authorization from U.S. health regulators for a second COVID-19 booster shot, as a surge in cases in some parts of the world fuels fears of another wave of the pandemic.
The U.S. biotechnology company said its request covered all adults over the age of 18 so that the appropriate use of an additional booster dose of its vaccine, including for those at higher risk of COVID-19 due to age or comorbidities, could be determined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and health care providers. 
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s request is significantly broader than  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX)'s application that was filed earlier this week with U.S. regulators for a second booster shot for people aged 65 and older.
Moderna, without specifically commenting on the effectiveness of a fourth shot, said its submission was partly based on data recently published in the United States and Israel following the emergence of the Omicron variant.
FDA did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
U.S. health officials, including top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, have raised the prospect of a fourth shot, especially for older people and to prepare for the possibility of another surge in cases.
CDC data has shown that vaccine efficacy wanes over time and a third shot helps restore it. It, however, has not released comprehensive data based on age or health status to back the case.
Pfizer and Moderna are betting additional booster doses will be needed as new virus variants emerge.

The news was first reported by the New York Times.
While COVID cases are falling in the United States and much of the world, infections are rising in China. In the UK and Europe, there has been a reversal in the downward trend of COVID cases as economies have opened up and a second variant of Omicron circulates.

(Reuters) - Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space tourism service has postponed until March 29 a flight initially set for next week, while ""Saturday Night Live"" comic Pete Davidson will not be a passenger on the launch, the company said on Thursday.
The company, in a brief notice first posted on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), gave no immediate explanation for the change or Davidson's withdrawal from the manifest of Blue Origin's fourth commercial flight since last summer.
Davidson, 28, the boyfriend of reality TV star and socialite Kim Kardashian, had just been officially named on Monday as Blue Origin's ""honorary guest"" to join five paying customers on the flight initially set for March 23.
With ""Davidson no longer able to join"" the new flight, Blue Origin said it would announce the sixth crew member ""in the coming days.""
The five previously revealed are angel investor Marty Allen; real estate veteran Marc Hagle and his wife Sharon Hagle; University of North Carolina professor Jim Kitchen and George Nield, founder-president of Commercial Space Technologies.
Like the first three groups of Blue Origin passengers, they will ride to the edge on a six-story-tall, fully autonomous spacecraft called the New Shepard, which will lift off from Blue Origin's launch site near the rural west Texas town of Van Horn.
The suborbital joyride, lasting about 10 minutes from liftoff to touchdown, will ascend to about 350,000 feet (106 km), treating passengers to a few moments of weightlessness, before a descent back to Earth for a parachute landing.
Bezos, the billionaire founder of online retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) tagged along himself on Blue Origin's inaugural crewed flight to space last July.

He accompanied his brother, Mark Bezos, trailblazing octogenarian female aviator Wally Funk and an 18-year-old Dutch high school graduate.
Later passengers included 90-year-old ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner, who became the oldest person to fly to space, ""Good Morning America"" co-host Michael Strahan, and the eldest daughter of pioneering astronaut Alan Shepard, after whom Blue Origin's spacecraft is named.

Estimating the year-to-date default rate at 5.5%, Kenneth Ho and Chakki Ting said in a note Friday that this headline figure understated stress in a sector where developers have entered into bond exchanges to avoid triggering defaults.
""If we assume all the bonds from issuers that have entered into bond exchange or maturity extension transactions as being in default, the (year-to-date) default rate would rise to 23.4%,"" they said.
Ho and Ting said they maintained a default forecast for the sector of 19% for 2022, with a bull case of 10.5% and a downside case of 31.6%.
""Whilst credit stresses have picked up, China policymakers have also reiterated their accommodative policy stance,"" they said, adding that ""risks are clearly tilted towards the downside case.""
Of bonds in the sector that have passed their final maturity dates so far this year, 31% have entered into bond exchange or maturity extension transactions, 26% have defaulted and 42% were fully repaid.

More bond exchanges and defaults are likely, with $2.3 billion maturing in April, and more than $3 billion each in June, July and August, they said.
Vice Premier Liu He, China's economic tsar, said on Wednesday that the government needs to reduce risks in the property industry, and proposed measures to facilitate a new development model for the sector.

The centre, its second R&D facility in China, will work in tech fields such as connectivity, automated driving and big data, the company said in a statement.
Mercedes-Benz did not elaborate on the size of its investment in the new tech centre, nor how many engineers it plans to eventually hire for the new location. 
It said in the statement it is ""aiming to attract hundreds of new tech talents"".

The establishment of a new Shanghai tech centre follows a move last year by the German premium carmaker to significantly upgrade its R&D capabilities in Beijing, by opening a new R&D facility in China's capital.
With 1,000 engineers, the new Beijing tech facility is more than three times the size of the one Mercedes-Benz opened in 2014, and the first outside Germany that is more ""on par"" technically with the firm's far bigger R&D headquarters near Stuttgart, a person close to the centre said at the time.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mixed on Friday morning, with a rally in Chinese shares in the U.S. cooling. Investors continue digesting mixed signals on peace talks to end the conflict in Ukraine.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.28% by 10:36 PM ET (2:36 AM GMT), with the Bank of Japan handing down its monetary policy earlier in the day. Data also showed that the national core consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.6% year-on-year in February 2022. The national CPI grew 0.9% year-on-year and 0.4% month-on-month.
South Korea’s KOSPI inched down 0.02% while in Australia, the ASX 200 was up 0.32%
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.7%.
China’s Shanghai Composite inched up 0.02% while the Shenzhen Component fell 0.64%. U.S.-traded Chinese shares eased a historic rally as investors await follow-up action from the government on its vow to stabilize markets.
The ceasefire talks to resolve conflict stemming from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 are also on investors’ radars. However, Russia has cast doubt on the talks’ progress and the Pentagon warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin may threaten to use nuclear weapons if the conflict drags on.
Global shares have rallied in recent days and are set for their best week since November 2020. This suggests that some of the worst fears about the inflationary commodity shock and the conflict in Ukraine are easing.
However, continued fighting and tightening Federal Reserve monetary policy could mean more cross-asset swings ahead.
“I don’t necessarily expect the rest of the year to be that easy,” RBC Capital Markets LLC head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina told Bloomberg.
“Volatility is likely to stay elevated for quite some time” even as sentiment gauges “have been a screaming buy in some respects for quite some time.”
U.S. President Joe Biden will discuss the situation in Ukraine with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later in the day. Biden will warn of “costs” if China backs Russia, according to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted to end Russia’s Most Favored Nation status, leading the way to sharply higher tariffs on Russian goods. S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Ratings also slashed Russia’s credit score to CC, saying its debt is “highly vulnerable to nonpayment.”
However, JPMorgan Chase & Co. processed funds for interest payments due on Russian government dollar bonds, which eased fears of a default.
U.S. data showed that building permits showed a reading of 1.859 million while contracting 1.9% month-on-month in February. The reading for housing starts was 1.769 million, while it grew 6.8% month-on-month.
The data also showed that industrial production grew 7.45% year-on-year and 0.5% month-on-month. This supported U.S. Federal Chairman Jerome Powell’s view that the economy can withstand monetary tightening.
Investors are now bracing for the quarterly triple witching event later in the day, where roughly $3.5 trillion of single-stock and index-level options are set to expire, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc."

The Shanghai factory restarted its two-shift production from 7 a.m. local time (2300 GMT) to run around the clock, said the people. Enough workers have returned to their positions after being cordoned off in nearby residential compounds for 48 hours where they were required to be tested for COVID-19, according to the people who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Reuters reported on Wednesday that the U.S. electric vehicle maker had suspended production at its Shanghai factory for two days, according to a notice sent internally and to suppliers, as China tightens measures to curb its largest outbreak in two years.
Tesla said on Thursday it was doing its best to keep production going at its Shanghai factory while it cooperates with China's COVID-19 prevention measures. It did not provide details.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index lost as much as 2.6% in early trading on Friday. It rose 21% in the previous two sessions, the most since 1998. The Hang Seng Tech Index slid 4.1%, with Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. leading the decline. 
Investors are taking a step back after rushing in to buy in the past couple days, as several concerns remain -- including the risk of possible U.S. sanctions on China given its ties with Russia. China’s muted response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has hardened views within the U.S. administration that President Xi Jinping may be moving closer to supporting Moscow as the conflict continues, according to several people familiar with the matter.
Beijing denies that it has tacitly backed the invasion and Chinese officials have rejected U.S. reports that Russia asked China for financial and military assistance shortly after touching off the war, labeling them disinformation.
READ: Biden Team Hardens View of China Tilting Toward Putin on Ukraine 
Investors will thus be keenly watching the planned meeting this evening between Xi and U.S. President Joe Biden.
While Beijing’s concerted effort to shore up confidence brought a knee-jerk jump in equities, skeptics have sought concrete policy steps before calling an end to the rout. A gauge of Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. also cooled off overnight, falling 4.6% after a 33% surge in the previous session.
On the positive side, expectations are growing for the People’s Bank of China to soon take easing steps to spur the economy, which may aid market sentiment. A growing number of economists anticipate banks will lower their quotes for the loan prime rate, the de facto benchmark lending rate, when it’s announced by the PBOC Monday.

673,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 09:02PM ET</span>",Investors find they have no easy alternative to chaotic LME nickel trade,"By Eric Onstad
LONDON (Reuters) -Despite the turbulent, stop-start trading of nickel on the London Metal Exchange, frustrated investors who may want to shift their business elsewhere have found there are no quick and easy alternatives. 
The 145-year-old institution suspended activity and cancelled trades last week due to volatility that saw prices double to above $100,000 a tonne within hours. A spate of technical glitches after trading resumed this week has left traders fuming.
Amid the chaos, some pointed to the Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE), where there have been few such interruptions to nickel trading, as a defacto benchmark. 
But a lot would have to change for ShFE to set global reference prices.
Trading on ShFE is difficult for non-Chinese, who need an affiliation with a Chinese entity. Then there are differences in currency and language and adjustments for duty and VAT, traders said.
Shanghai also has a lot of small-scale retail speculators, whereas the LME is dominated by financial institutions, producers and industrial users.
""I don't think there's a quick fix. It's a real problem,"" said Tom Price, head of commodities strategy at Liberum.
""In the longer term the LME seems to be in lots of trouble.""
The LME benchmark nickel contract slumped to $41,945 a tonne on Thursday, hitting its daily limit for the second day in a row.
Traders said it would probably continue to slide until it reached parity with the price of the metal in China at about $34,300 a tonne. 
However, European industrial users were not flocking to Shanghai, one trader at a LME ring-dealing member said.
""I don't see any physical players pricing on ShFE, even the Chinese themselves, but longer term, the LME has to get its house in order,"" he said.
The LME called last week's situation ""unprecedented"". 
""However, we fully recognise that we must consider taking action in order to prevent such a situation from happening again,"" a spokesperson said. ""We will consider carefully any appropriate future steps we could take to further build market resilience.""
ShFE was not immediately available for comment.
Price said that until orderly trading of the LME nickel contract resumes, some local physical buyers may need to somehow peg their business to exchange prices reported before the disruption.
CHINA PRICING POWER
In the longer term, China as the world's biggest consumer and producer of many commodities, wants to take a greater role in establishing global prices.
""The nickel futures incident highlights the importance and urgency of promoting internationalisation of relevant nonferrous metal futures,"" said Duan Shaofu, an official from the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association.
Establishing Chinese-based international base metals contracts would reinforce China's commodity pricing power, he added in an article posted on the group's website on Thursday.
New international contracts may follow the lead of a copper futures contract that is open to foreign traders, launched in 2020 on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE). https://reut.rs/3D4xbuF
CME OPPORTUNITY?
Another possibility is the CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME) launching a nickel contract alongside its successful copper futures. 
The CME declined to comment.
Although it has rolled out contracts in aluminium, zinc and lead, they have so far failed to gain momentum.
Copper performs strongly on the CME because its contract, with a traditional monthly settlement date, is easy for hedge funds and speculators who often use the metal as a proxy for the global economy.
Complex LME contracts, in contrast, allow trading any single day for the first three months, set up to allow miners and industrial consumers to hedge physical shipments for odd periods.

The physical basis of the LME, which is owned by Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd., will make it difficult to dislodge the exchange from setting global benchmarks, despite the current ructions.
""I don't think the LME is going to be replaced easily,"" said a Chinese industry source in London. ""I know a lot of people are disappointed and angry, but I think there's still a strong rationale for the LME.""

SEOUL (Reuters) -As COVID curbs cut travel and duty-free shopping, South Koreans are driving a luxury goods boom at home that has left Chanel barring nearly a third of would-be shoppers to stop bulk buyers snagging $10,000 bags for resale with markups of 20% or more.
The storied French fashion and luxury company told Reuters it has seen traffic to its boutiques in South Korea skid since it began screening for customers it believed might be stocking up purely to flip to others in the resale market.
""We were able to identify them (bulk buyers) after having analysed their buying patterns. Since this policy was implemented, the traffic in our boutiques has decreased by 30%,"" Chanel told Reuters in a statement. It didn't disclose exactly how it deemed those customers to be potential bulk buyers, and the privately owned business doesn't disclose sales numbers by country.
Chanel's strategy, implemented since July last year, came as global demand for luxury goods was picking up after the worst of the coronavirus pandemic. South Korea is the world's seventh-biggest luxury goods market according to Euromonitor, and the research firm estimates it was one of only two of the top seven markets by revenue - the other being China - to see sales grow last year from 2019 levels.
Supply at brands like Chanel, though, is tightly controlled, preserving exclusivity and boosting appeal with no online shopping option beyond cosmetics, perfumes and some small accessories. Such is the appetite in downtown Seoul that long queues form before dawn outside department stores as shoppers brace for what's known as an 'open run' - a sprint to Chanel's doors at opening time.
""I arrived ... at 5.30 a.m. for an open run and I was notified that there were more than 30 people in front of me,"" a shopper told Reuters in front of a Chanel boutique in Seoul. Speaking on condition of anonymity because of privacy concerns, he said by the time he entered the store - nearly 10 hours later - the item he wanted was sold out.
Reflecting such red-hot demand in the resale market, a Chanel medium classic flap bag was sold at 13.5 million won ($11,031) - 20% more than its standard retail price - in January on KREAM, a platform offering everything from sneakers to tech and luxury goods that is an affiliate of tech giant Naver Corp.
KREAM, an acronym for 'Kicks Rule Everything Around Me', was launched in 2020. It told Reuters its monthly transactions exceeded 100 billion won in December, and said South Korea's resale market is worth more than 1 trillion won - nearly $820 million - even at the most conservative estimates.
'QUEUE MANAGEMENT'
While resale platforms like KREAM offer a range of brands, Chanel, like Swiss watchmaker Rolex, is a particularly sought-after brand because of its status among couples in South Korea as one of the most popular wedding gifts, and frequent price increases of its most iconic handbags.
    Chanel increased prices of some handbags, accessories and seasonal ready-to-wear earlier this month in Asia and Europe, including by 5% in South Korea - where prices have just been raised for the fifth time in nine months, according to Chanel Korea.
In tandem with its screening for bulk buyers, Chanel said it has implemented a ""queue management system"": Clients are asked to give their contact number and reason for visiting the store so that they can be informed via text messages when they will be able to enter the boutique.
Brand experts and consumers are divided on the impact of the new buying pattern on Chanel.
""Consumers are voluntarily doing free ads for Chanel – camping outside (boutiques), doing open runs, posting their experiences on social media,"" said Lee Eun Hee, a professor of consumer science at Inha University.
""I think all those phenomena have helped Chanel draw younger customers and make a big chunk of money off it.""
'LINE STANDERS'
Still, some consumers say long queues and waiting lists have put them off.
""I just gave up buying a Chanel product long ago,"" said a Seoul resident in her 30s, declining to be named due to privacy concerns. 
""It's too difficult to buy one, with some 300 people usually on a waiting list, and by the time it's my turn, there is no product left. This really puts me off and I don't want to be at the centre of this craziness.""
Not giving up any time soon are the bulk buyer-resellers.
Speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, some resellers told Reuters they're hiring ""line standers"" for a fee of up to $125 a day to stand in queues or enter stores on their behalf. 
One reseller in his 30s told Reuters he's been reselling his purchases at usually more than 20% profit - and it can be far more profitable when inventory level is low.

He said he sold a Chanel flap card holder recently on secondhand marketplace app Karrot for nearly 1 million won, 40% above its retail price - five minutes after it went up for sale.

CHICAGO (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Thursday said its Chief Executive Larry Culp would take a 67% cut to an incentive grant this year after shareholders last year rejected his compensation package in a non-binding but rare rebuke over executive pay.
In its annual proxy statement filed on Thursday, the Boston-based industrial conglomerate said Culp's annual equity incentive grant for 2022 will be reduced to $5 million from $15 million. 
The company also disclosed Culp's annual compensation last year was about $22.7 million, down 69% from 2020, due to a reduction in stock awards.
Proxy votes against executive pay at S&P 500 companies became more common last year and were often sparked by ""questionable practices and metrics,"" such as easier performance targets during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report by shareholder advocacy group As You Sow.
Among the S&P 500, a record 16 companies had the pay of their CEOs and other top leaders rejected by more than half of investors last year, up from 10 in 2020 and seven in 2019, the report said.
As part of an extension of Culp's employment contract to 2024, GE in 2020 canceled old shares he had been given and granted him new shares tied to lower financial targets. The compensation package entailed a payout through 2024 of as much as $230 million.
Some 57.7% of GE shareholders last year rejected the pay deal, according to preliminary results, which some proxy advisory firms argued was too generous.
GE said in the proxy statement its board had gathered feedback from shareholders on the issue and tried to address concerns related to compensation matters.
While defending the 2020 grant, the company said its board does not intend to enter into a similar modification of the CEO's employment agreement in the future.

It also promised to use discretion sparingly in determining bonus pools.
GE's annual shareholders meeting is scheduled in May.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian stock exchange operator B3 reported on Thursday its recurring net profit for the fourth quarter grew by 6.0%, but was slightly below analysts' estimates.
The company posted recurring net profit of 1.23 billion reais ($244.05 million), compared with the market consensus, compiled by Refinitiv, of 1.27 billion reais. 
Net revenue fell 4.2% to 2.18 billion reais, while revenues from the firm's listed segment, which includes equities and equity instruments, shrunk 5.5%.
The sharp rise in interest rates and inflationary pressures in Brazil in the last three months of 2021 led to a decrease in the number of public offerings during the period, with only one initial public offering and two follow-ons.
Even so, ""B3 continued to see high trading volumes on its platforms,"" the company said in its earnings report. The average daily traded volume on the Sao Paulo stock exchange was 31.53 billion reais in the quarter, mostly in line with the previous year. 
The company posted recurring earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 1.65 billion reais, while its EBITDA margin fell by 278 basis points to 75.9%, mainly due to B3's strategy to lower trading fees as more Brazilians start to invest.

According to B3, the number of individual investors in Brazil grew 37.6% during 2021, reaching almost 3.7 million people.

(Reuters) - All three of Wall Street's major indexes advanced more than 1% on Thursday as investors considered the Federal Reserve's path for interest rate hikes and worries eased about the prospects of a Russian default after creditors received payments.
Investors were reassured that Russia may, at least for now, have averted what would have been its first external bond default in a century. This was because creditors received payment, in dollars, of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week, two market sources told Reuters on Thursday.
The S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq registered their biggest 3-session percentage gain since early November 2020 after the reports boosted risk appetites in a market already benefiting from bargain hunting. The S&P 500 also witnessed its third straight day of more than 1% advances.
The Fed had raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday as expected and forecast an aggressive plan for further hikes while policymakers also trimmed economic growth projections for the year.
The Russian payment news and a breaking of technical decline lines ""to the upside"" in indices, including the S&P and the Nasdaq, all boosted stocks, according to Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.
""It's giving investors an increased level of cautious optimism which is a change from the significant pessimism we've been experiencing since early January,"" said James.
""People have gotten more comfortable with the fact rates are going higher. This has been talked about ad nauseum by Chairman (Jerome) Powell since early December,"" he said. ""The fact there were no significant negative surprises in the Fed's plans coming out of the meeting, and Powell's commentary, gave people a sense that maybe we've seen as bad as it's going to get in the near term.""
Describing the Fed's plans as dovish, Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York also said the continuation of Russia, Ukraine peace talks helped the mood.
""What you're seeing today simply as a spillover effect from yesterday,"" said Blancato. ""There's a potential resolution for the conflict overseas, the positive effects of the Federal Reserve and stocks at a very fair entry point, providing an opportunity to add risk.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 417.66 points, or 1.23%, to 34,480.76, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 53.81 points, or 1.23%, to 4,411.67 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 178.23 points, or 1.33%, to 13,614.78.
The energy sector .SPNY was the biggest percentage gainer among the S&P's 11 major industry sectors, ending up 3.5% as oil prices rose 8% as the crude market rebounded from several days of losses with a renewed focus on supply shortages in coming weeks due to sanctions on Russia. O/R
The sector laggards were more the most defensive industries with utilities .SPLRCU adding just 0.5% and consumer staples .SPLRCS, which rose 0.6%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) on Thursday expanded its services to allow Ukrainian citizens and refugees to receive payments from overseas, a move a senior Ukrainian official called a huge help as Russian forces continued to attack the country.
PayPal Chief Executive Dan Schulman told Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov in a letter that Ukrainians would also be able to transfer funds from their PayPal accounts to eligible credit and debit cards. The company has waived its fees on such transactions through June 30. 
More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled the country since Russia launched its invasion on Feb. 24, an action Russia has described as a ""special military operation."".
PayPal's move will allow refugees and Ukrainians to receive funds from friends and family members in the United States and elsewhere, and could also be used to transfer social payments by governments in the future, said Vladyslav Rashkovan, Ukraine's alternative executive director at the International Monetary Fund.
""It makes a huge difference for people,"" Rashkovan told Reuters, lauding Schulman's personal engagement in accomplishing the change in just two weeks.
Rashkovan said he spoke with some Ukrainians on the street outside his office about the new capability and they immediately opened an account at PayPal.com/ua/home https://www.paypal.com/ua/home to send money to their relatives. Ukrainian officials have been pushing for the expanded services since 2015, after Russia annexed the Crimea region, he added.
PayPal said it would start making the expanded services available on Thursday, with customers able to send and receive funds from their Ukrainian PayPal Wallet in dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds and euros. 
Once a customer transfers funds from their PayPal Wallet to an eligible Visa (NYSE:V) or MasterCard debit or credit card, the money will be available in the currency associated with that card.
While PayPal is waiving its fees for several weeks, it noted exchange rates and fees charged by a customer’s card issuer or bank account may still apply.

Previously, Ukrainian citizens could send money from PayPal accounts, but were unable to receive funds.
PayPal earlier this month shut down its services in Russia, joining many financial and tech companies in suspending operations there after its invasion of Ukraine.

The company last year signed a deal to buy 28 planes from Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co , which it argued would result in $2 billion of savings.
The previously announced fleet upgrade could help reduce the company's fuel costs since Boeing 737 MAX cost 20% less than their predecessors to operate, said Rene Armas Maes, commercial vice president and aeronautical consultant at Jet Link International LLC.

Beyond upgrading its fleet, Aeromexico needs to implement technology that further reduces unit costs, so it can better compete with local low-cost carriers Volaris and Viva Aerobus, and its peers operating international routes, he said.
In a news release, the carrier said it will also restart some international routes it had halted during the pandemic, including to London, and open new ones.

(Reuters) -U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX) posted lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday, hit by ongoing labor woes and the Omicron outbreak, and said second-half Ground margins will miss internal targets. 
Shares of FedEx fell 3.5% to $219.90 in extended trading.
E-commerce shipments fueled revenue at FedEx and  United Parcel  Service (NYSE:UPS) during the COVID-19 pandemic, but FedEx has been less successful than its rival at translating that additional business into profit.
While labor challenges began to ease in the latest third quarter, FedEx Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam said volume was softer than forecast due to Omicron. 
""As such, we expect our second-half Ground margins will be lower than our previous expectations and not reach double digits,"" Subramaniam said. 
Executives said volume rebounded as Omicron waned. Still, analysts called out the growing gap between the Ground operations at UPS and FedEx. 
""You guys are operating, give or take, at an 8% margin. UPS is on its way to 12(%). You guys used to be better,"" said Wolfe Research analyst Scott Group. 
""We're laser-focused on improving our margins,"" Subramaniam said.
In January, FedEx warned that Omicron infections had caused pilot shortages and delayed shipments in its aircraft-dependent Express operation. That news came after FedEx said staffing shortages in its non-union, contractor-based Ground division were hurting profits and delaying deliveries.
Meanwhile, the unionized workforce at UPS has been a bright spot in the tight U.S. labor market. UPS offers employees better pay and benefits than their non-union peers that deliver for FedEx and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), which have struggled to hire and retain drivers and other key workers.
Memphis-based FedEx's adjusted net income for the fiscal third quarter increased almost 30% to $1.22 billion, or $4.59 per share. However, that missed analysts' call for a profit of $4.64 per share, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S Estimates. 

Revenue for the quarter ended Feb. 28 grew nearly 10% to $23.6 billion.
FedEx on Thursday affirmed the full-year forecast it reinstated in December, again calling for earnings excluding items of $20.50 to $21.50 per share. In September, FedEx lowered that range to $19.75 to $21.00 per share.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) -Electric carmaker Lucid is looking into raising prices for future models, its chief executive said on Thursday, citing ""huge inflationary pressures"" but said the company was committed to honoring prices for existing reservation holders.
""There's an inevitability that we will have to look at the price points of models that are coming out in the future,"" CEO Peter Rawlinson told Reuters, citing soaring nickel prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. 
""I think it would be absolutely foolish of me to say we're never going to raise our prices,"" Rawlinson said in the interview on the sidelines of the South by Southwest music, technology and film festival (SXSW).
""What we want to do is to honor and keep our commitments to existing reservation holders. I think that's what was ill received in the market with Rivian.""
He was referring to this month's decision by electric truck maker Rivian to hike prices on existing reservations and then reverse course after consumers protested.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc has recently raised vehicle prices in the United States and China after CEO Elon Musk said the biggest electric carmaker faces significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics. 
Lucid in February cut its production forecast for this year to a range of 12,000 to 14,000, from its original target of 20,000 vehicles, citing ""extraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges."" Its shares slid after that announcement.
Rawlinson on Thursday said the bottlenecks were caused by a handful of suppliers for windshield glass, carpeting and some exterior trim parts. 
""I'm super frustrated because we're not gated by silicon chips, we're not gated by our ability to make electric motors,"" Rawlinson said.
Switching to different suppliers for those parts would compromise quality, he said. 
He questioned whether Rivian would be able to make a profit on its pickup trucks without raising prices, given the costs of battery packs. 
""I don't think even we could, with the best technology in the world, make an affordable, practical pickup,"" he said. 
Tesla, which is developing its own electric pickup, faces a ""primary challenge"" in making it affordable, CEO Elon Musk said this month. ""If it is extremely hard to do so for Tesla, despite our much greater economies of scale & better technology, then it is damn near impossible for others,"" Musk said.

Rivian was not immediately available for comment.
Rawlinson also said Lucid has started on a prototype of in-house battery cell production, adding that it also has partnerships with battery suppliers Samsung (KS:005930) SDI and LG Energy Solutions.

Russia's payment woes stem from international sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, the ratings agency said. The sanctions have reduced the country's available foreign exchange reserves and restricted its access to the global financial system.
""Although public statements by the Russian Ministry of Finance suggest to us that the government currently still attempts to transfer the payment to the bondholders, we think that debt service payments on Russia's Eurobonds due in the next few weeks may face similar technical difficulties,"" the agency said. 
Peer agencies Fitch and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) had also cited concerns about Russia's ability to meet its debt obligations when cutting the country's rating by several notches earlier in March. 
Fitch said on Tuesday Russia's ratings would be further lowered to ""restricted default"" if the coupon payments are not made in U.S. dollars, in line with the original terms, by the end of a 30-day grace period.
Russian bonds are hovering at deeply distressed levels in very illiquid trading, with most issues trading less than a handful of times a day, according to Refinitiv data.
Adding to Moscow's debt troubles, an exemption that currently allows U.S. citizens or residents to receive Russian debt and equity payments will run out on May 25.

After the sanctions exemption deadline and until year-end, Russia is due to pay nearly $2 billion more on its external sovereign bonds.
Some creditors have received payment, in dollars, of Russian bond coupons which fell due this week, two market sources told Reuters on Thursday. Some other creditors said they are yet to receive their funds but were optimistic they were on the way, according to the report.

Ted Baker and Sycamore declined Reuters requests for a comment.
Ted Baker's shares closed up 8.88% on Thursday at 98.75 pence, giving the company a total valuation of 182.3 million pounds ($239.65 million), Reuters calculations based on Refinitiv Eikon data showed.

NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions activity has tailed off after a record-breaking 2021, as the war in Ukraine adds to a bevy of distractions faced by corporate boards and management in their existing businesses.
Bankers and lawyers speaking at the Tulane Law conference in New Orleans on Thursday noted that while conversations were still taking place and deals would continue to get done, the market volatility of recent weeks has made signing off on acquisitions more tricky.
""I'm finding myself, as a banker, advocating 'no' to selling a company much more than I ever have before,"" said Gordon Dyal, the managing partner of investment banking advisory Dyal & Co.
""No matter how attractive that premium is, the chance the deal falls apart and it's 18 months or 12 months from now, even if you negotiate a huge break fee, it doesn't matter because it does not compensate a company for its lost franchise."" 
The widespread economic and geopolitical upheaval caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine is having significant ramifications on companies' operations, sucking up the attention of leadership and putting some inorganic growth plans on the backburner.
""It's very hard to have a board meeting to talk about M&A deals when you're sitting there wondering whether your general manager in Russia is going to go to jail for who knows how long, in a country where all of a sudden there truly are no rules,"" said Scott Barshay, chair of the corporate department at law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.
Global dealmaking this year through mid-March is down around 20% on the same period in 2021, according to data provider Refinitiv.
While megadeals have tailed off, in the face of heightened regulatory scrutiny from the Biden administration, private equity firms continue to deploy substantial cash piles into new purchases.
Refinitiv data shows that while overall dealmaking is down, transactions involving buyout firms globally are up 12% year-to-date.
For corporations though, the ripples from war in Eastern Europe, which Russia calls a ""special operation"", are creating challenges on the back of emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, plus supply chain issues and inflationary pressures.
CONNECTIONS
A unique aspect of this is that many corporate boards, which have been refreshed with new directors in the last two years - either by choice or amid investor pressure - have not met in person during the pandemic, making building trust between boards and management more difficult.
Lawyers said this lack of connectivity makes boards more cautious about pursuing growth opportunities that could include acquisitions, sales or other structural changes.
""It is really hard to build up a sense of collegiality and trust and confidence in that environment. And, after all, boards are human beings and deals rely on people trusting each other and trusting the advice that they are receiving,"" said Melissa Sawyer, global head of M&A at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP.
The Tulane event, one of the most influential gatherings in the dealmaking community, is hosting its 34th edition in person, having been forced online last year by the pandemic. Its last live conference in 2020 took place just days before lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 were implemented.
As well as enjoying the benefits of meeting others in the flesh, and reestablishing professional and personal connections, the dealmakers spoke of confidence that their business would be equally buoyant in the months ahead.

""It's busy. It's still busy. I think on the public side, we're seeing a lot of deals,"" said Barshay of Paul, Weiss.
""I still have the numbers, even if the sizes are a bit lower.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street stocks rebounded from early session losses on Thursday as investors weighed economic implications of the Federal Reserve's surprisingly aggressive interest rate stance, while oil prices surged on supply shortage concerns arising from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The Fed announced a quarter of a percentage point increase to near-zero interest rates on Wednesday, its first hike in nearly three years as it sought to combat soaring prices. The U.S. central bank also projected six more similarly sized rate hikes this year, sparking worries among traders about the effect on economic growth.
U.S. Treasury yields held just below three-year highs on Thursday and the closely-watched yield curve steepened, after earlier sitting at its flattest level in more than two years.
Benchmark 10- and 2-year yields were last at 2.1653% and 1.969%, respectively.
""The big surprise yesterday was the dot plot,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital in New York, referring to the Fed's interest rate projections.
""It was a dovish hike but a hawkish rhetoric and outlook. We believe that if they get anywhere near their projections they'd invert the yield curve and cause a guaranteed recession."" 
On Wall Street, the three main indexes reversed early losses, driven by the healthcare, consumer discretionary, technology, and financial sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.23%, to 34,480.76, the S&P 500 gained 1.23% to 4,411.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.33% to 13,614.78.
""We had a relief rally yesterday and the market is digesting that today, consolidating a little bit and trying to get comfort with the reality versus expectations in terms of what the Fed is projecting,"" Hayes added.
European stocks also gained in choppy trading following the Fed rate hike and a similar move by the Bank of England.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.45%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.77%.
Oil prices rose more than 8%, continuing a series of wild daily swings, as the market rebounded from several days of losses on renewed focus on supply shortages in coming weeks due to sanctions on Russia.
Benchmark Brent crude futures settled 8.79% higher at $106.64 a barrel, its highest percentage gain since mid-2020. 
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 8.35% to $102.98 a barrel. 

The dollar index, which measures the greenback's strength against six trading currencies, was last down 0.47% at 98.026.
Gold rose 1% as the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields retreated. Spot gold added 0.7% to $1,942.04 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures gained 1.62% to $1,939.00 an ounce.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fox News on Thursday appealed a judge's decision to let voting systems company Smartmatic pursue a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit alleging that the network falsely accused it of rigging the 2020 U.S. presidential election against incumbent Donald Trump.
The network, part of Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp, also countersued Smartmatic to recoup legal costs, saying the lawsuit was designed to stifle its constitutionally protected right to inform viewers about newsworthy events.
Thursday's filing came nine days after Justice David Cohen of the New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan found a ""substantial basis"" to suggest that the network ""turned a blind eye to a litany of outrageous claims"" about Smartmatic, evincing a ""reckless disregard"" for the truth.
""It is ironic that Fox claims that Smartmatic's lawsuit is without basis"" after that decision, Smartmatic's lawyer J. Erik Connolly said in an email. He said courts around the country reviewing similar claims ""are saying something very different.""
Smartmatic accused Fox News and several on-air personalities in its February 2021 lawsuit of decimating its business with a bogus narrative that its election software helped Democrat Joe Biden steal the 2020 election from Trump, a Republican.
The Florida-based company said Fox News did this to cater to Trump supporters, boost ratings and keep viewers from defecting to the smaller right-wing networks Newsmax and One America News.
In Thursday's filings, Fox News called the $2.7 billion damages claim ""pure fiction.""
It cited a report by University of Chicago law professor Daniel Fischel that Smartmatic had been a ""failing enterprise"" with $82.8 million of losses over five years and four straight years of declining revenue.
Fox News also said Smartmatic's claims violated New York's November 2020 ""anti-SLAPP"" law, short for ""strategic lawsuits against public participation"" and meant to protect journalists from frivolous lawsuits designed to harass critics.
""New York's anti-SLAPP statute was made for lawsuits like this one,"" Fox News said. ""The best way to deter baseless attacks on the freedoms of speech and efforts to chill the press is to provide robust protection for speech on matters of public concern.""
In a separate case, a federal judge on March 11 rejected Trump's bid to invoke the anti-SLAPP law against E. Jean Carroll, a writer who said Trump defamed her in 2019 by denying he raped her in the mid-1990s.
Cohen also let Smartmatic sue anchor Maria Bartiromo and former anchor Lou Dobbs and pursue some claims against former Trump lawyer and on-air guest Rudy Giuliani.

In December, a Delaware judge rejected Fox News' attempt to dismiss a similar $1.6 billion lawsuit by another voting technology company, Dominion Voting Systems.
The case is Smartmatic USA Corp et al v Fox Corp et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 151136/2021.

Investing.com – Stocks rallied on Thursday as investors settled into the knowledge that the Federal Reserve is likely to raise rates at each of its remaining meetings this year, after lifting the short-term benchmark a quarter-point on Wednesday.
The Fed’s move was of course well-telegraphed and long expected. The central bank’s policy setting members are forecasting the fed funds rate to end up the year around 1.9%
Despite rising rates, tech stocks rose 1% on Thursday. Normally rising interest rates would spark a sell-off in growth stocks, but investors can’t seem to resist big tech companies.
The broader rally in stocks could also indicate investors believe the Fed will be able to fight inflation by raising rates without tipping the economy into a recession, as is what tends to happen.
Economic data on Thursday showed new claims for unemployment insurance dropped to 214,000 last week, beating expectations. Continuing claims dropped to the lowest level since 1970.
Earnings season is largely over, though a couple more reports are due out from GameStop and FedEx on Thursday after the closing bell.
President Joe Biden is scheduled to talk with China’s Xi Jinping on Friday, expected to emphasize the consequences of assisting Russia either militarily or financially in getting around Western sanctions for its incursion into Ukraine.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Another day watching oil
The International Energy Agency said three million barrels per day of Russian oil and products could be shut in from April, and that sent energy stocks up, including Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), and APA (NASDAQ:APA) which rose more than 9%, 9% and 7%, respectively.
Occidental Petroleum was also boosted by news that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) purchased 18.1 million more shares of Occidental.
2. Logistics play
FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX)missed earnings per share expectations, while revenue exceeded forecasts thanks to a boom in online shopping. FedEx revealed earnings per share of $4.59 on revenue of $23.6 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $4.68 on revenue of $23.4 billion.
The company said its results benefited from lower variable compensation costs and less severe winter weather, resulting in favorable year-over-year comparisons. However, the positive numbers were partially offset by the effects of the Omicron variant and higher purchased transportation costs and wage rates.
3. GameStop earnings
 GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME) fell more than 7% in after-market trading after it reported a fourth quarter loss of $1.86, from $1.39 a year earlier, but that missed expectations for a profit of 85 cents a share. Revenue rose to $2.25 billion from $2.12 billion a year earlier.
GameStop, one the original so-called meme stocks, entered into a partnership with Immutable X to create a marketplace for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. The partnership will provide the company with up to $150 million in IMX tokens upon achievement of certain milestones.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coupon payments on Russian sovereign bonds due this week were received by correspondent bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), processed and the bank then made an onwards credit to the paying agent Citi, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday, an indicator that the country may have averted default.
The payment received was a U.S. dollar payment, the source said. After being credited to the paying agent, it would be checked and distributed on to various bondholders, the source said. 
Russia said on Thursday it had made debt payments that were due this week. Russia was due to pay $117 million in coupon payments on Wednesday on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds and some creditors had received payments, market sources separately told Reuters, also indicating it avoided what would have been its first external bond default in a century. 
The payments were widely seen as the first test of whether Moscow would meet its obligations after Western sanctions hobbled its financial dealings. 
The source said that JPMorgan's obligation as a foreign correspondent bank was to process payments, but that given the circumstances, also to check with authorities before doing so.
Sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine have cut Russia off from the global financial system and blocked the bulk of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, while Moscow has in turn retaliated - all of which complicate payments. 
The bank checked with authorities before processing, the source said. Not to process the payment would have harmed bondholders, the source said. 

Under the sanctions and restrictions announced last month, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.S. banks were prohibited from correspondent banking - allowing banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, within 30 days. Washington and its partners also started barring some Russian banks from the SWIFT international payment system - a step that will stop lenders from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide.
A March 2020 report https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2003g.pdf by the Bank for International Settlements showed that correspondent banks have been ""paring back their cross-border banking relations for the past decade."" The number of correspondent banks fell by 20% between 2011 and 2018, even as the value of payments increased, the report said.

The company reported a fourth quarter loss of $1.86, from $1.39 a year earlier, but that missed expectations for a profit of 85 cents a share. While revenue rose to $2.25 billion from $2.12 billion a year earlier, below estimates of $2.16 billion.
GameStop, one the original so-called meme stocks, entered into a partnership with Immutable X to create a marketplace for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. The partnership will provide the company with up to $150 million in IMX tokens upon achievement of certain milestones.
In its push to make a big splash in the world of cryptocurrency, the video game retailer said it hired ""dozens of additional individuals with experience in areas such as blockchain gaming, ecommerce and technology, product refurbishment and operations.""

Investing.com -- Shares of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) rose 2% in extended trading after the company reported its fiscal third quarter ended February 28. 
The company missed earnings per share expectations, while revenue exceeded forecasts.
FedEx revealed earnings per share of $4.59 on revenue of $23.6 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $4.68 on revenue of $23.4 billion.
The company said its results benefited from lower variable compensation expense and less severe winter weather, resulting in favorable year-over-year comparisons. However, the positive numbers were partially offset by the effects of the Omicron variant and higher purchased transportation costs and wage rates.
“We successfully executed during the holiday peak season, resulting in record December operating income,” said Michael Lenz, FedEx Corp. executive vice president and chief financial officer. 
“Our strong quarterly operating income increase was dampened by the surge of the Omicron variant which caused disruptions to our networks and diminished customer demand in January and into February. We remain focused on revenue quality and operational efficiency initiatives to mitigate inflationary pressures and drive earnings improvement,"" added Lenz.
Looking ahead, the company expects earnings per share for the fiscal year to be between $18.60 and $19.60."

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 rallied Thursday, led by energy as investors mulled the Federal Reserve’s plan to hike rates several times this year, and the reports suggesting that a solution to ending the Ukraine-Russia war is still some ways off.
The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.2%, or 416 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3%.
Energy stocks rallied sharply, up more than 3%, as oil prices clawed back some recent losses to trade above $100 a barrel after Russia downplayed progress on peace talks with Ukraine.
The Kremlin reportedly said that news pointing to progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks was “wrong,” prompting investors to resume bets for a prolonged war that could disrupt energy supplies and keep oil prices rising.
Adding to expectations for a shortfall in supply, the International Energy Agency said three million barrels per day of Russian oil and products could be shut in from April.
Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), and APA (NASDAQ:APA) were up more than 9%, 9% and 7% respectively.
Occidental Petroleum was also boosted by news that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) purchased 18.1 million more shares of Occidental.
Consumer discretionary was also involved in the heavy lifting of the broader market, pushed higher by in Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Garmin (NYSE:GRMN) and Dollar General (NYSE:DG).
Dollar General jumped more than 4% as the company hiked its quarterly dividend by 31% after reporting fourth-quarter results that missed on both the top and bottom lines.
 Pagerduty Inc  (NYSE:PD) rallied more than 20% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results, as new product launches helped bolster results.
Bank stocks, meanwhile, which delivered swashbuckling gains on Wednesday, failed to keep up momentum as the further flattening in the yield curve - when short term rates increase faster than longer term rates – added to worries about the Federal Reserve causing a recession by slowing the economy down too much.
Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB), Regions Financial (NYSE:RF), Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC) were down more than 1%.
“We would expect some type of inversion of the yield curve, which is definitely going to get the recession word thrown around much more given that it's going to skew growth to the downside,"" David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors told Investing.com in an interview on Thursday.
Tech, meanwhile, was the relative underperformer on the day as big tech traded mostly positive, led by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but weakness in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) weighed."

The Moscow District Arbitration Court was unable to provide information by phone and did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Google, which Tsargrad said blocked the YouTube account in July 2020, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Google was disputing a daily 100,000 rouble ($1,050) fine it was ordered to pay in April 2021 after failing to unblock Tsargrad TV's YouTube account, a Christian Orthodox channel owned by businessman Konstantin Malofeev.
The Moscow Arbitration Court said last year the daily fine would double each week that Google failed to comply. Tsargrad said Google already owes 1 billion roubles in fines, as of mid-March. 
""Currently, writs of execution have been issued, enforcement orders have been initiated and funds sufficient to fulfil the court acts have been seized from Google's accounts,"" Tsargrad said in a statement. 
A simmering confrontation between Moscow and foreign tech firms has escalated in light of the crisis in Ukraine, and Russia has blocked access to Meta Platforms Inc's flagship social media, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram. 
Tsargrad has said the fine would stop compounding when it hit 1 billion roubles. From September, that limit will be removed. 
The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Malofeev in 2014 over accusations that he funded pro-Moscow separatists fighting in Ukraine, which he denies. Russia considers such Western sanctions illegal.
Malofeev said Tsargrad intends to file new lawsuits against Google, demanding the channel's YouTube accounts be unblocked in other countries.
""Some local courts will refuse to support us, for example, in the United States, because I am under sanctions. And elswehere they will help us,"" Malofeev told Reuters. 

""Thank God Google exists in India, China, Brazil and other countries. We will collect the money there until the court decision is fully realised.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Burger King's parent company said on Thursday it has not been able to close its 800 restaurants in Russia because its independent operator there ""refused"" to do so.
Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc said that to enforce its contracts with the franchisee, Alexander Kolobov, it would need the help of the Russian government, but ""we know that will not practically happen anytime soon,"" according to a letter to employees from David Shear, president, international, of the company.
It was not immediately clear how to reach Kolobov for comment.
Shear's long letter highlights the many complications bedeviling some American fast-food brands as they try to halt operations in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
It also exposes what can become a point of weakness in international franchising, which is how most American restaurant brands expand overseas: the relationships with their independent operators.
On March 8,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and a wave of other companies followed McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) in saying they would suspend or limit operations in Russia.
Like Burger King, Starbucks does not own or operate its more than 100 cafes there. 
But unlike Burger King, it had a willing partner - Kuwait-based Alshaya Group - that immediately agreed to shut its Starbucks' locations in Russia and support its 2,000 employees.
Restaurant Brands entered Russia a decade ago through a joint venture partnership with three entities: Kolobov, who controls day-to-day operations, private equity and asset management firm Investment Capital Ukraine, and Russia's state-owned VTB Bank, which has been hit by Western sanctions.
Restaurant Brands has started the process to dispose of its 15% ownership stake in the joint venture. It wants to do so immediately, Shear said, but it will take ""some time"" based on the terms of the agreement.

There are ""no legal clauses that allow us to unilaterally change the contract or allow any one of the partners to simply walk away or overturn the entire agreement,"" Shear wrote.
""Would we like to suspend all Burger King operations immediately in Russia? Yes. Are we able to enforce a suspension of operations today?"" he wrote. ""No.""

However, the analyst revealed respondents that were “Extremely/Very satisfied,"" came in at 52%, down 9% quarter-over-quarter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Homeland Security Department said Thursday it was naming the chief executives of General Motors (NYSE:GM), United Airlines American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and others to an advisory council.
Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said he was adding 33 members in advance of the council's first meeting set for Monday, which is tasked with helping ""define the department’s strategic vision, strengthen the department to better meet the increasingly dynamic and rapidly evolving threat landscape, and harness technology and innovation to modernize the programs it administers."" 
Others being named include the chief executives of Polaris (NYSE:PII),  Duke Energy  (NYSE:DUK) and Chobani LLC.
Mayorkas told reporters that he picked ""leaders in a diverse array of fields with a diverse breadth of expertise, so that not only can we tap that expertise, but quite frankly, we can hear from them the concerns that they have.""
U.S. airlines have faced international travel restrictions over the past two years over COVID-19 and have been pressing the Biden administration in recent weeks to end requirements for masks on airplanes and to end a requirement that international air passengers get a negative COVID-19 test a day before flying to the United States.
Automakers, including GM, were hit by border disruptions from Canadian trucking protests in February that caused cuts to production in the United States.
Mayorkas said the executives would help the department ""capitalize on the power of technological innovation, and serve our country by living up to our highest ideals.""

The Transportation Security Administration plans to launch a pilot project with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to allow people in eight states to add their driver license or state ID to their iPhone and Apple Watch Wallet for use at airport checkpoints.

In a statement, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) said it would welcome all MGM employees to the company and work with the studio's leadership, indicating there would not be layoffs. Its decision to close comes after a deadline passed for the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to challenge the deal.
The Seattle-based retailer announced the transaction in May 2021, saying MGM offered a trove of content to draw consumers to its fast-shipping and streaming club Prime, which costs $14.99 per month in the United States.
Nearly a year later, Amazon is clear of regulatory hurdles. The European Commission approved the deal Tuesday, with no conditions. Likewise, Amazon earlier informed the FTC that it had ""substantially complied"" with requests for information about the deal.
According to Amazon, MGM's staff will join the organization of Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios.
MGM bolsters Amazon Prime Video's offering with more than 4,000 film titles, as well as this year's Oscar-nominated ""Licorice Pizza"" and a long list of television shows that may help Amazon compete with streaming rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+.
Hopkins praised MGM's ""broad slate of original films and television shows.""
""We welcome MGM employees, creators, and talent to Prime Video and Amazon Studios, and we look forward to working together,"" he said in a statement.

An FTC spokeswoman declined to comment on the specific transaction but noted that the agency may challenge a deal after it closes ""if it determines that it violates the law.""
The FTC has a broader probe open into Amazon as part of government antitrust investigations begun under the Trump administration into the four big tech platforms, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

""Pirelli is against this war... The investments in the local market, excluding those linked to security, have been halted,"" the tyremaker said in a statement with its annual financial results.
It added that ""activities of the factories in Russia will be progressively limited to those needed to guarantee the financing of salaries and social services for employees.""
The company had said earlier this month that it did not plan to close factories as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine..
Pirelli manufactures around 10% of its global tyres output in two plants in Russia. The Russian market itself however accounts for only 3% of the group's total revenues and for 4% of its adjusted operating profit.

It has set up a committee to monitor the development of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, ""for which mitigation actions and a contingency plan have already been activated"".
Pirelli added it would inform the market if its financial forecasts shift significantly from what it set out in February when it provided full year results and guidance just before the invasion of Ukraine began.

Lennar, which beat first-quarter revenue estimates a day earlier on soaring home prices, also lifted its full-year homebuilding revenue outlook to $32 billion, up from its previous view of $31 billion.
However, the company cautioned that supply chain disruptions and inflation have sent prices of raw materials, specifically lumber, surging – leading to an increase in the number of days it takes to complete building a home.
""The ability to actually build and deliver homes has been slowed by the supply chain that is all but broken,"" Chairman Stuart Miller said.

Lennar, in a conference call with analysts, said it expects second-quarter earnings of $3.80 to $4.00 per share versus $3.75 per share expected by analysts.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Carrier Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) will help planemaker Airbus in its effort to develop a hydrogen-powered passenger airplane, the companies said on Thursday.
Delta is the first U.S.-based airline the European planemaker is partnering with for hydrogen aircraft. Atlanta-based Delta said the partnership does not entail any financial investment on its part.
Airbus has plans to produce a small ""ZEROe"" passenger aircraft powered by hydrogen to enter service in 2035, and wants to get feedback from customers while the new aircraft is being developed, Amanda Simpson, vice president for research and technology at Airbus, said in an interview.
""We're in...the pre-product development phase, where we're trying to understand clearly what is the realm of the possible - what is going to work,"" Simpson told Reuters.
Last month, Airbus said it would build a demonstrator to test propulsion technology for hydrogen airplanes in co-operation with French-U.S. engine maker CFM International.
Amelia DeLuca, vice president of Sustainability at Delta, said the collaboration would focus on understanding the requirements for the new plane's deployment including the production of green hydrogen in the United States and its accessibility at the country's airports.
The carrier said the partnership would also advocate for a decarbonized future in aviation, including hydrogen pathways, with key stakeholders.

U.S. planemaker Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has been more skeptical about commercial prospects for hydrogen-powered air transport by 2035, putting greater public focus on sustainable aviation fuels.
Delta is one of the biggest customers of Airbus. As of end-December, it had 368 Airbus planes in its fleet. The company has purchase commitments for another 245 Airbus planes and has options for additional 120 aircraft.

(Reuters) -Impossible Foods founder Pat Brown will step down as chief executive and hand over the reins to Peter McGuinness, the former chief operating officer of Greek-yogurt maker Chobani, as the alternative meat producer expands rapidly and launches new products.
Brown, who founded the plant-based burger maker in 2011, will remain a director and take on the title ""Chief Visionary Officer"" to focus on research and technology and new initiatives, the company told Reuters.
McGuinness will be tasked with steering the company at a time when the plant-meat sector faces cooling demand after an investment frenzy in the past few years and launches by major fast food chains Burger King and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD).
McGuinness, who takes over on April 4, plans to announce new launches and make the company's products available at more retail stores.
""We just need more people to try it,"" McGuinness said in an interview, adding that he is ""very bullish"" about the plant-meat sector.
""We have more work to do on the distribution side ... We could easily triple, if not, quadruple the distribution points (in the United States) at retail.""
Impossible's plans to launch new products and expand globally as well as the momentum in the brand mean ""the leadership demands of the commercial business will inevitably continue to grow,"" Brown wrote in a blog post on Thursday that confirmed the change in leadership.
Impossible launched a spate of products, including imitations of chicken nuggets,  sausages and  meatballs, last year as it looks to create more demand for its products. The company said its quarterly retail revenue at the close of 2021 jumped 85% year-over-year.
Rivals Maple Leaf Foods and Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), however, flagged demand concerns in their latest quarterly results.
Reuters reported last year that Redwood (NYSE:RWT) City, California-based Impossible was exploring options for going public at a valuation of $10 billion or more.

McGuinness said there was no urgency as the company has enough capital to fuel its growth.
At Chobani, McGuinness also served as the company's president and was in charge of research and development and the company's expansion into new categories such as plant-based probiotic drinks, oat milks and coffees.

713,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 12:42PM ET</span>","'Sustainable' funds are no more green than traditional products, study finds","LONDON (Reuters) - Investment funds that market themselves as sustainable under European rules get similar levels of ""green revenues"" through the companies they invest in as traditional funds, according to a new study published on Thursday.
So-called ""green revenue"" is the percentage of sales generated from products that benefit the environment such as with cleaner water or contribute to mitigating climate change. 
Clarity AI, a sustainability data technology platform part-owned by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), analysed 31,000 funds to assess how they perform against a new European Union classification system that defines a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. Its research found that just 3.6% of revenues globally are ""green"".
Under the European Union's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, fund managers can classify their products by the degree to which they promote environmental, social and governance goals. 
They can market themselves as either Article 8, which means fully or partly focused on environmental, social or sustainability issues, or a more stringent Article 9, which means fully focused on sustainable objectives. 
Investments that fund firms class as Article 6 mean that they do not focus on sustainability.
Clarity found that for Article 8 funds, 3.9% of their revenue through the portfolio companies they own can be classified as green, similar to the 3.1% share for Article 6 products.
Funds in the smaller pool of Article 9 had 15% of revenue as green.
""Article 8 funds are defined as 'promoting E or S characteristics', which is a vague term. As such, we are seeing the market interpreting this term often by integrating a very light touch of sustainability-related considerations into their strategy,"" Patricia Pina, Clarity AI's Head of Product Research & Innovation, told Reuters.

While new and still-emerging EU regulatory frameworks have been hailed for trying to improve transparency in the fast-growing world of ESG finance, vague definitions can result in managers loosely interpreting the sustainability credentials of their funds.
Earlier this year Morningstar, which closely tracks the funds industry, stripped more than 1,000 funds of their ESG label in its classification system after finding they did not live up to their sustainability claims.

The company has hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 11%, to 20 cents per share. Margins improved on higher sales and tighter control on distribution costs. This was even as selling, general and administrative expenses rose because of advertising to push holiday sales.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose 29% to $2.8 billion. Brick and mortar sales were higher as customers returned to stores, shunning online that grew in the single digit range.

About a quarter of Russian oil exports, including flagship Urals and ESPO Blend oil grades, is usually sold on a spot basis, normally via public tenders in which a number of companies generally have been invited. 
As of March 17, Russian oil companies haven't issued any spot tenders for May ESPO Blend, which would normally be offered in tenders by this time. No spot tenders for Urals loading in early April have been issued either, according to the loading plan for April 1-5 released on Wednesday, traders said.
Spot tenders had been a perfect instrument to place spot barrels, and the results of the tenders were used by the market as a price reference.
Since the end of February, however, tenders have been shunned by buyers spooked by sanctions imposed on Russia by Western nations targeting Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.
As part of its sanctions, the United States has implemented a ban on Russian oil. However, the European Union - a much larger importer - has not.
Even so, there has been a chilling effect on the oil trade with buyers loath to be seeing doing business with Moscow, and U.S. and EU sanctions on Russian banks have complicated deal-making.
""Tenders are of no use now. They only frighten potential buyers,"" a source with a Russian oil company told Reuters.

Russia's Surgutneftegaz and Zarubezhneft companies have failed to place Urals oil in tenders, while India's ONGC was unable to attract bids in a tender for Sokol crude. 
Russian oil companies and foreign buyers have been looking for workarounds to their regular trading practices given the sanctions-related pressure on the market, such as offering alternative payment methods and conducting transactions in alternative currencies.

LYON, France (Reuters) - When French company boss Laurent de la Clergerie decided to let his staff work a four-day week, on the same pay as before, he knew he risked hurting his bottom line. ""Some people took me for a crazy person,"" he recalled.
But a year on, he says the opposite has happened: his LDLC company selling consumer technology has increased its annual turnover by 40% without hiring any extra staff.
The secret, he said, is that the approximately 1,000 people his firm employs feel trusted and appreciated, and so they are more productive.
""At the end of the day, it's brought only good things for the team,"" said 51-year-old de la Clergerie.
As the world emerges from a pandemic that prompted many people to re-evaluate their work-life balance, companies and workers around the world are asking if, like de la Clergerie's firm, they could work less.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gave its 2,300 Japan-based employees Fridays off in 2019, and said it saw productivity rise 40%. Consumer group Unilever (NYSE:UL) launched a four-day week trial for local staff in New Zealand. Spanish telecoms company Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) has trialled a four-day week for 10% of its domestic workforce.
Johann Peters, who works in one of LDLC's stores near its headquarters in a suburb of Lyon, south-east France, uses the extra day off to head to the supermarket to pick up his weekly shopping. He then takes his daughter, 9-year-old Melissa, to her tennis practice.
""You come into work after your day off much more rested, and more efficient operationally,"" he said.
De la Clergerie said before he embarked on the change, he worked out that even in the worst case scenario, it would add to labour costs by at most 1.5 million euros per year. He said he felt that was a manageable risk.
Since then, he said that absenteeism and sick leaves were down, and that the company had not had to hire new people to offset the reduction in hours worked. 
Though the four-day week was not the only factor involved, de la Clergerie said it had contributed to a jump in turnover from around 500 million euros before the change, to close to 700 million euros ($769.86 million) since then.
Celine Henniaux, a 36-year-old who works in one of the firm's distribution centres, said she had no desire to go back to the way things were before.
""No no,"" she said. ""We've got a taste for having a day off during the week.""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker Zenith, owned by French luxury giant LVMH, expects to post double-digit sales growth in the first quarter, but is carefully watching the implications of the crisis involving Russia, its chief executive said on Thursday.
""Every time there is geopolitical instability in the world it leads to a context of anxiety that is not good for business,"" Julien Tornare told Reuters in a phone interview.
""Purchasing power, the price of petrol, the price of gas are worries for people and the mood may not be as good as we had hoped,"" said Tornare, who has been leading the brand since 2017.
He said, however, that most markets, in particular the United States, were still doing well, and he was confident the brand would achieve double-digit sales growth in the first quarter and was also aiming for that for the year as a whole.
Rival Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) confirmed on Thursday it expects double-digit sales growth this year and no material impact on business from the crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Tornare said Russia was not a key market for the brand, even though it had a long history there. ""When the situation allows it, we'll redeploy means to develop that market,"" he said.
Its parent company LVMH temporarily closed its 124 boutiques in Russia on March 6, saying it would continue to pay the salaries for its 3,500 employees in the country.
He said new lockdowns in China to rein in COVID-19 were a concern, but China remained an important growth driver in the longer term. ""We had a good start in China in January. February and March were a bit more quiet.""
Tornare said the brand wanted to absorb part of the higher costs for energy and raw materials, but would raise prices globally by 2% to 4% on certain collections within the next weeks. The average price is currently at 10,000 euros ($11,087.00), 30% higher than when Tornare took over as CEO.

Based in Le Locle in western Switzerland, Zenith is known for its El Primero watch mechanisms launched in 1969 that only survived the arrival of battery-powered quartz watches in the 1970s because a foreman hid the tools and plans in an attic at the factory against management orders. Modernised versions of the El Primero still power Zenith watches today, notably its Defy collection.

U.S. discount stores have seen improving store traffic, as people gradually resume their pre-pandemic life after an Omicron-led pause.
The pandemic-led trend of cooking at home, however, has sustained as restaurants have raised prices, keeping grocery sales elevated. Dollar General, in particular, has been adding fresh produce to more stores, while also doubling down on frozen and refrigerated categories.
It also said products priced $1 or less form one-fifth of its assortment, while rival Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR) recently raised product prices to $1.25 from $1.
""Our customer runs out of money before that month runs out. And that $1 bridges that last few days for her, always has, and that continues to do so,"" Chief Executive Officer Todd Vasos said during an earnings call.
Dollar General forecast fiscal 2022 net sales to increase about 10%, while analysts on average expect growth of 7.5%, according to Refinitiv IBES. It also projected profit growth of 12% to 14%, versus estimates of 9.3%.
That compares to dull sales forecast from Dollar Tree, which typically sells more non-essentials.
""There's no question that Dollar General has significantly outperformed Dollar Tree from an execution standpoint,"" Truist Securities analyst Scot Ciccarelli said.

Dollar General's shares, however, pared premarket gains to trade 3% higher as cost pressures, supply disruptions and waning impact of stimulus checks prompted it to forecast a downbeat first quarter.
It expects to earn between $2.25 and $2.35 per share and same-store sales to decline 1% to 2% for the quarter ending April 29. Analysts expect same-store sales to increase 1% and adjusted per-share earnings of $2.73.

Representatives for Pfizer and Moderna did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuits.
Shares of Moderna, whose lone commercial product is its COVID vaccine, were off about 4%. Pfizer shares were up 1.7% and Alnylam was up 2%. 
Alnylam's lawsuit against Moderna says it discussed licensing its technology to the company in late 2013 or 2014, and shared confidential information about it with Moderna at the time.
The lawsuit against Pfizer said Alnylam's LNP technology is also ""essential"" to the effectiveness and safety of Pfizer's vaccine.
Arbutus Biopharma (NASDAQ:ABUS) Corp separately sued Moderna in Delaware federal court last month, claiming Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine infringes its patents, which also relate to RNA-delivery technology.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health has also implied it may sue Moderna over a vaccine-related patent application that NIH says should have listed its scientists as co-inventors.

Microsoft simultaneously announced plans for the construction of the data centres, which will be powered by renewable energy, with their location chosen to allow for recycling of heat created from the cooling of computer servers.
District heating is widely used in Finland, pumping hot water through pre-insulated underground pipes, and has traditionally relied on fossil fuel sources.
Fortum operates a system of underground pipes stretching 900 kilometres and serving 250,000 users in the Helsinki metropolitan area. Once completed, the data centres will account for 40% of the system's heat supplies, the two firms said.
Fortum said its investment for the heat capture side from the data centres was estimated at 200 million euros ($221 million), with expectations this would cut some 400,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.
Microsoft declined to say how much it would invest in the centres.
It estimated however that it would initially require some 400-500 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable energy per year, which it said was comparable in scope to other local industries such as a paper or pulp mill.

Microsoft plans to buy the electricity via one or several long-term power purchasing agreements (PPA), although no supplier has yet been selected, the company told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) shares rose on Thursday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc said it spent nearly $1 billion on additional shares in the oil company, giving it a 14.6% stake.
Berkshire disclosed in a Wednesday night regulatory filing that it owns 136.4 million Occidental shares, including 18.1 million purchased between Monday and Wednesday.
Buffett's company began disclosing this month that it was investing in Occidental common stock, on top of $10 billion in preferred stock it already owned. Berkshire has spent at least $6.4 billion on the common stock, regulatory filings show.
In morning trading, Occidental shares were up 8.5% at $57.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. They traded below $9 as recently as October 2020.
Occidental shares have benefited in part from rising oil prices and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a special operation.
Vicki Hollub, Occidental's chief executive, said this month that supply chain troubles and labor shortages make it difficult for oil companies to ramp up production to meet demand.
Occidental is also trying to cut debt by more than half and boost payouts to shareholders, including through a higher dividend announced last month.
Berkshire bought its preferred stock in 2019 to help finance Occidental's $35.7 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
The preferred stock throws off $800 million of annual dividends. Berkshire also has warrants to buy $5 billion of additional Occidental stock at $59.62 per share.

It isn't clear whether Berkshire is funding its latest purchases with available cash or by selling other stocks it owns, which include  Chevron  Corp. (NYSE:CVX)
Berkshire ended 2021 with $146.7 billion of cash and equivalents. It was a net seller of stocks in 2021, and Buffett said in his Feb. 26 annual shareholder letter ""we find little that excites us"" in equity markets.

Adding to the gains is the company’s plan to do a $175 million accelerated share repurchase.
Adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter rose 3.6% to 15.7% because of higher markups, fewer discounts, and lower occupancy costs. Retailers have been able to cut back on discounts as demand has stayed elevated while inventories are stabilizing.
The gains were partially offset by lower comparable sales in Europe and higher inbound freight costs.
Assuming no meaningful COVID-related shutdowns, the company expects 2023 revenue to grow in low-single digits. It forecast a deterioration in operating margin, but still sees it close to 10.5% for the year. Revenue in 2022 was $2.6 billion.
Fourth quarter adjusted profit per share was $1.14, while revenue was down 5% to $800 million.
CEO Carlos Alberini said the company’s 26% return on invested capital for the year is the highest it has been in ten years.
“Our balance sheet is strong, and we plan to use our capital opportunistically to return value to our shareholders through dividends and increased share repurchases.”

Virgin Orbit will work with the Polish Space Agency (POLSA) to analyze LauncherOne's (Virgin Orbit's domestic launch system) applications ""in support of Poland’s science and economy industries.""
Virgin Orbit said Poland’s space development body conveyed a strong interest in bringing domestic launch capability to Poland.
""LauncherOne has demonstrated its unique ability to open space launch solutions for regions where spaceflight would otherwise be limited or impractical – a solution made possible through a dedicated carrier aircraft and ground support systems,"" the company said.
“Today’s agreement marks an important step to providing assured access to space for Poland and surrounding nations--serving Polish industry, science and security,” added Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart.
Virgin Orbit shares rose 5% in early Thursday trading. However, they are down 22% so far this year."

SYDNEY/MILAN (Reuters) -Italian luxury yacht maker Ferretti Group is expected to kick off on Monday the process to list its shares in Hong Kong, aiming for a valuation of around $1 billion as it sells a 25% stake, two sources close to the matter said.
Ferretti, controlled by Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group, is pushing ahead with its initial public offering (IPO) despite the conflict in Ukraine rattling financial markets and hitting shares in the superyacht sector.
The pre-marketing phase ends on Friday and the company, which ditched a previous IPO attempt in Milan in 2019, could still change its plans depending on the market.
Ferretti has sought to play down the impact of international sanctions against Russian oligarchs on its business. It has said that countries involved in the conflict account for less than 3% of its revenues and it has no exposure to the largest mega-yachts more likely to be targeted by sanctions.
Shares in listed Italian rivals such as Sanlorenzo and The Italian Sea Group plunged in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, shedding between a quarter and a third of their value, but have cut losses in the past 10 days. 
""The supportive environment enjoyed by the yachting industry over the past 12 months will continue over the mid-term,"" Berenberg said in a recent note, adding the share slide provided a good entry point.
Ferretti met with investors and analysts over the past two weeks and it is slated to launch the institutional offering on Monday, broadening it to retail investors the following day, one of the sources said.
Having met interest including from Western names and securing support from cornerstone investors that could make up about 60% of the deal, it aims to raise $300 million selling newly-issued shares for an overall valuation of around $1.2 billion, the source said.
A second source pointed to a $900 million valuation.
Both sources said shares are expected to start trading at the end of March. IPOs in Hong Kong normally take around four days with another five days before the trading debut.
Ferretti is expected to use the proceeds to expand its range of yachts while also developing services such as yacht brokerage and chartering.
The 54-year-old company, which runs six shipyards in Italy, owns brands such as Pershing, Riva and Wally, in addition to Ferretti Yachts.

Ferretti filed with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at the end of December, with investment bank CICC as sole sponsor as well as joint global coordinator together with BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY).
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained more than 5% on Thursday, adding to Wednesday's 9% surge driven by the prospect of fresh Chinese economic stimulus.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has undermined hopes for renewed growth in Central Europe's car industry this year and for the wider economy, just as businesses were looking forward to a recovery from the pandemic.
Audi Hungaria Chairman Alfons Dintner told a media briefing the factory in the western town of Gyor was already changing its engine manufacturing shifts and had stopped exports to Russia, in line with a decision by Audi owner Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
But the impact on the Hungarian factory would ""not be dramatic"" he said, adding that the plant produced 1.6 million engines last year, including 250,000 electric drivetrains.
""Our revenue will be slightly lower, but this is still the beginning of the year, and we have lots of serious opportunities, so there is a good chance for us to make up for many things by the end of the year,"" Dintner said.
Suzuki's Hungarian factory has also suspended car exports to Russia and Ukraine as of March, while German premium carmaker Daimler-Benz said it had lowered output to two shifts at its Hungarian plant.

Dintner said the Hungarian Audi factory, whose revenue rose by 2.6% to 7.7 billion euros ($8.52 billion) last year, had fulfilled all orders so far despite supply chain challenges, adding that its order books were in a good shape.

The Justice Department filed a lawsuit to ask a judge to stop the deal in February, saying it would give the largest U.S. health insurer access to its competitors' data and ultimately push up healthcare costs. 
Judge Carl Nichols, who was nominated by then-President Donald Trump, said that the trial would last 12 days with the Justice Department allotted seven days and the companies five.
The companies had asked for the trial to start around June 20 while the government had suggested August 24.
In their answer to the government's complaint, UnitedHealth and Change said that one of concerns that the government had about the deal would be moot because they planned to sell Change's claims editing business, which they advertise as a way to ""improve payment accuracy, reduce appeals, and reap both medical and administrative savings.""
The companies said that they would fight the government on the other harm allegedly caused by the merger. The government had said that UnitedHealth could misuse data from Change's network and hoard innovations so as to better compete in selling health insurance to big corporations.
""Plaintiffs' hypothetical speculation about data and innovations ignores stark market realities and is entirely inconsistent with UHG's long history,"" the companies said in their answer to the government complaint. 

UnitedHealth announced the all-cash deal in January 2021, saying it would help streamline administrative and payment processes.
UnitedHealth and Change Healthcare offer competing software for processing healthcare claims and together serve 38 of the top-40 health insurers in the country, the Justice Department said in the complaint. They would have at least 75% of that market, it said.

The Japanese government on Dec. 24 selected three consortiums, all led by Mitsubishi, as the operators of offshore wind farms in Akita, northern Japan, and Chiba, near Tokyo, with a total generation capacity of 1.7 gigawatts (GWs).
Mitsubishi's rivals were stunned by the low tariff prices the trading house's group had proposed - 11.99 yen ($0.1) per kilowatt hour (kWh), 13.26 yen kWh and 16.49 yen kWh - far below a ceiling price of 29 yen kWh.
But Yoshihiro Iwasaki, the chief executive of Mitsubishi Corporation Energy Solutions Ltd, said on Thursday: ""We will be fine.""
""We made our bids by accumulating all the costs from suppliers, after thinking out specifications and construction methods to trim expenses,"" he told Reuters on the sideline of the Smart Energy Week event.
""That was after we had examined all the risk factors and made thorough discussions with our group's experts at home and abroad.""
One executive at an overseas wind power company, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the issue, predicted Mitsubishi will likely make losses following its success at the auction.
""The results sent a shockwave to the industry as their prices were so low,"" he said, speaking on the sidelines of the same event.
Asked whether Mitsubishi will make bids with similar or lower tariff prices in the future tenders, Iwasaki said it will depend on a project as each site has different conditions.

A number of global wind power companies such as Denmark's Orsted (OTC:DOGEF) and Germany's RWE are keen to enter Japan's market. The government plans to install up to 10 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, and up to 45 GW by 2040.

Investing.com –  Warby Parker  (NYSE:WRBY) stock traded 3% lower Thursday after the eyewear retailer’s 2022 forecast fell short of estimates.
The company said it lost sales of around $15 million to disruption caused by Omicron at the start of the year. It cost the company 3 percentage points of growth, Warby Parker said. The company has, for long, strived to prove that eyewear retailing can be a business of scales and profits.
The company now expects current-year revenue to be $655 million at the midpoint of its guidance range, up 21%. This compares to the 2021 revenue of $541 million, which grew over 37% year-over-year.
WRBY went public through a direct listing on NYSE in September. Its market cap has since halved to $3 billion now.
The company closed the year with 161 stores across U.S. and Canada; opened 35 new stores year-to-date, including seven openings in the quarter. It has a unique ‘Buy a Pair, Give a Pair’ program under which it gives a pair to someone in need against every pair of glasses or sunglasses sold.
Margins improved slightly in the quarter due to the scaling up of progressive lenses business, partially offset by increased penetration of contact lenses.
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose due to higher staff compensation and more spending on marketing to push sales in the holidays.
Net revenue jumped 17.8% year-over-year to top $133 million. Net loss was higher by $41.6 million, reaching $46 million due to higher SG&A expenses."

The decision means Samsung is not restricted on its sales under Russian law, although the company said this month - in a move unrelated to the case - it would halt shipments of devices to Russia because of ""geopolitical developments"".
Many foreign firms have halted business in Russia after Western powers imposed sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine crisis.
The lawsuit against the South Korean company filed last year by Switzerland-based SQWIN SA claimed Samsung Pay infringed its electronic payment system patent registered in Russia.
The ban was never implemented because Samsung appealed the initial ruling and efforts by SQWIN SA for interim measures to be imposed were not granted.
The Russian court upheld Samsung's appeal, Russia's RIA news agency reported.
Court officials did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
""We are fully satisfied with the appeal decision and that Samsung's arguments were carefully considered and accepted,"" said Natalia Gulyaeva, managing partner at Hogan Lovells in Moscow, one of Samsung's legal consultants on this case. 
Samsung said it welcomed the decision. SQWIN SA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

A court ruling in October listed 61 Samsung models the company was prohibited from importing and selling in Russia, citing the patent numbers.
Samsung was the market leader in Russia's handsets market in the fourth quarter of 2021, with 30% market share, ahead of Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF)'s 23% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s 13% respectively, according to data provider Counterpoint.

Investing.com -- Wall Street rallied in New York on Thursday, lifted by the energy sector after strong data on jobs followed the expected interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. 
By 4:12 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 417 points, or 1.2%, the S&P 500 rose 1.2% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.3%. The Dow rose 1.5% on Wednesday after the Fed raised rates by 25 basis points and signaled at least another six quarter-point increases over the next 12 months.
The hike had long been anticipated by markets, which chose to focus instead on the accompanying economic forecasts from the Fed, which suggested that the tightening cycle could proceed without causing a recession.
Also helping the mood on Wednesday had been reports of a detailed peace plan drafted by Ukraine and Russia. However, the Kremlin said Thursday that reports of significant progress were ""wrong"" and Russia has reacted angrily to President Joe Biden's designation of Vladimir Putin as a ""war criminal"" on Wednesday. The comments followed reports of a Russian strike on a theater in Mariupol that was being used as a shelter by hundreds of civilians of all ages.
Analysts warned against what appeared to be some ""magical thinking"" by both the Fed and by some market participants, noting that even a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine will not remove all the headwinds currently blowing.
""It would be unwise to assume that even if actions do follow words, there is a return to the pre-war status quo,"" said Paul Donovan, chief economist of UBS Wealth Management, in a morning briefing. ""Sanctions are likely to be unwound slowly...There has been an irreparable break in how the world works.”
Thursday will be the busiest day this week for U.S. economic data. Weekly jobless claims came in at 214,000, slightly below expectations. February housing starts rose 6.8% and building permits were down 1.9%. The Philly Fed index was 27.4, above expectations for a reading of 15. 
In corporate news, Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) quarterly report included guidance that was above expectations and a warning about the loss of business in Russia, while Dollar General (NYSE:DG) more or less met estimates for profit and revenue. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) reports after the bell.
In commodity markets, oil prices have rebounded as the Kremlin downplayed peace talks, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates rebuffed pleas from U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson for more oil. By 4:12 PM ET, U.S. crude futures were up 8.6% at $103.28 a barrel, while Brent was up 8.9% at $106.75 a barrel.
Gold Futures were up 1.5% at $1,937 an ounce.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday, giving back from of the gains they made in the wake of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike and press conference despite a raft of data showing strong momentum in the economy.
By 9:45 AM ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 88 points, or 0.3% at 33,975 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%. The Dow had gained 1.5% on Wednesday, the S&P 2.2% and the Nasdaq 3.8%. 
The market appeared unable to shake its fixation with the war in Ukraine, which continues to escalate with reports of Russia sending reinforcements to the region from the Far East and Caucasus, as well as shelling targets around Odesa, an important port city still under Ukrainian control. The U.S. said it will send $1 billion in additional military aid to Ukraine on Wednesday, including armed drones. The White House said earlier that President Joe Biden will talk to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping about the war and other matters of mutual interest on Friday. 
Earlier, new data showed a sharp rebound in U.S. housing starts in February, while building permits stayed close to their highest levels in 15 years. In addition, U.S. manufacturing production rose at the fastest clip in four months and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's index of manufacturing activity rose by far more than expected. The number of people receiving ongoing jobless benefits, meanwhile, fell to the lowest since 1970.
Profit-taking was in evidence in many sectors, notably in Chinese ADRs after their ferocious rally on Wednesday in response to promises from vice-premier Liu He of more 'understanding' and supportive regulation in the future.  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs both fell 6.6%, while  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) fell 11%. Robin Brooks, an economist with the International Institute of Finance, noted that China is currently experiencing substantial capital outflows even while other emerging markets are receiving inflows. This pattern, he said, has ""never happened before on this scale and reflects asset managers looking at China in a new light after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.""
Among individual movers, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) edged up 0.4% after closing the acquisition of movie studio MGM, a deal that it hopes will bolster the position of its video streaming operations. 
 Warby Parker  (NYSE:WRBY) underperformed after the eyewear retailer reported a sharp widening in its net loss during the holiday quarter. It also guided for full-year sales more than 5% below consensus forecasts. Warby Parker stock was down 1.1%
Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) went sharply in the other direction, rising 6.3% after raising its dividend and beating estimates with its quarterly results. Dollar General (NYSE:DG) stock also rose 1.5% after the company said it expects high inflation to make Americans more price-sensitive this year. It too raised its dividend.
Elsewhere, oil and gas stocks were supported again as crude oil prices surged over $100, following comments from the Kremlin playing down the prospect of an early peace and consequently the restoration of unhindered Russian oil supplies to world markets. The International Energy Agency predicted on Wednesday that as much as 3 million barrels a day of Russian crude could be shut in as a result of the sanctions imposed by the West.

The upbeat forecast, which did not include the impact from the war, helped drive shares 2.4% higher in early trading.
Earlier this month, Accenture said it was discontinuing business in Russia. Revenue from the country stood at about $120 million during fiscal 2021, a fraction of its overall revenue of $50.53 billion in the year.
Chief Financial Officer KC McClure told analysts the forecast took into account the revenue impact of discontinuing its business in Russia and the cost of winding it down. 
But it was difficult to predict the impact of the war since it was still very early, and hence the forecast ""does not take into account any significant escalation or expansion of economic disruption or the complex current scope,"" she added.
The company expects current-quarter revenue between $15.70 billion and $16.15 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $15.11 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
Sanctions and other measures imposed on Russia in response to its actions in Ukraine have increased the level of economic and political uncertainty, Accenture said. 
The company, whose clients include more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500 companies across communications, media & technology as well as financial services industries, is also strategically investing in cloud, acquisitions and partnerships to gain more market share.

Revenue for the second quarter stood at $15.05 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $14.65 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.54 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $2.39 per share.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss watchmaker Swatch Group (SIX:UHR) does not expect a material negative impact on its sales or regarding access to raw materials following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its Chief Executive said on Thursday.
Nick Hayek said Russia accounted for around 1% of group sales and it didn't source any gold from the country that has been hit by western sanctions. The company's cheaper Tissot and Swatch labels were its biggest brands in Russia, showing its business there was ""not only oligarchs,"" he told a press conference on its already announced annual results.
""We have no sources (of) gold in Russia,"" Hayek said. ""The other precious materials, we also have a lot of stock and multi sourcing ... so for the Swatch Group, we see no impact, except for prices that will maybe go up over the mid or long term.""
""We are shocked about the situation, it's only been three weeks,"" Hayek said. ""We should all take three deep breaths and hope a solution will be found.""
The group, also known for Omega and Longines timepieces, said last week it had temporarily suspended the operations of its stores in Russia ""due to the increasing complexity and difficulty of the situation"" after initially only halting exports.
Doing business in Russia has become complex since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted the United States, Britain and the Europe Union to impose sweeping sanctions.
Only about 1% of Swiss watches were exported to Russia last year, watch federation statistics http://www.fhs.swiss/eng/statistics.html show, but wealthy Russians also like buying luxury goods abroad. 

Swatch Group sells many watches via wholesale partners, but Hayek said it also had 52 stores in Russia. 
One of its brands, Longines, opened its first flagship store in Moscow last year and Swatch Group's more affordable Tissot brand also developed its retail network and signed agreements for new monobrand pop-up stores in various regions in Russia. Its Swatch brand also opened two new stores in Moscow last year.

(Reuters) - Cineworld expressed confidence on Thursday that a meatier slate of movies in 2022 would help the British cinema chain bounce back from a two-year lull, although its mounting debt pile remained a challenge.
The world's second largest cinema chain with over 9,000 screens globally, Cineworld said its 2021 losses narrowed to $708 million from about $3 billion in 2020, thanks partly to Marvel superhero blockbuster ""Spider-Man: No Way Home"".
This year it is pinning hopes on sequels such as James Cameron's ""Avatar 2"" and Tom Cruise in ""Top Gun: Maverick"" as well as several Marvel films.
But any movie delays and further COVID-19 restrictions that could hit ticket sales pose a risk to its ability to repay credits due in June and early 2023, Cineworld said.
Its net debt stood at $8.9 billion at end-December, up some $600 million from 2020. Refinitiv data showed its credit score had sunk to 1, the lowest on a scale of up to 100, meaning it was highly likely to default in the next year.
Cineworld's setbacks include a potential multi-million-dollar fine in a dispute with Canada's Cineplex and delayed payments to disgruntled former shareholders of its U.S. chain Regal.
Cineworld has warned that it would not have enough liquidity to pay the C$1.23 billion ($971 million) sought by Cineplex as damages if its court appeal is unsuccessful.
It is now looking for new sources of liquidity after raising over $425 million last year, it said on Thursday.

Cineworld, which operates in 10 countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, admitted 95 million movie-goers in 2021, up 75% over 2020, but well below the 275 million seen pre-pandemic.

Even as Japan's dominance of consumer electronics had faded, manufacturers have carved out a world-leading niche in highly specialised components such as Murata's ceramic capacitors and Sony's image sensors.

The magnitude 7.4 tremblor struck just before midnight on Wednesday east of the Fukushima prefecture, the same area that suffered Japan's biggest quake 11 years ago.
Renesas last year emerged as a supply chokepoint after a fire broke out at its Naka plant in Ibaraki prefecture. 
The firm, which makes nearly a third of the microcontroller chips used in cars globally, said on Thursday it had temporarily halted production at two plants and partially stopped output at a third.
Among them was the advanced 300 millimetre wafer Naka plant. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) said as much as 80% of its lost vehicle production in the second quarter of last year was due to the fire. 
Kyoto-based Murata, the top global supplier of ceramic capacitors, which are used in smartphones, computers and cars, said it had suspended operations at four factories following the quake. 
A fire, later extinguished, broke out at one facility producing chip inductors, it said.
Highlighting the strain on the auto industry, Japan's largest automaker,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, said its global production target would be 10% lower in May and 5% lower in June than previously estimated.
The revised estimates did not include the impact of the quake, it said.
While many of the companies are not household names in the West, such makers are increasingly being seen as key national assets amid growing tech competition between China and the United States. 
One of Japan's best known conglomerates, Sony, said it halted production at two factories in Miyagi prefecture and a third factory in Yamagata prefecture producing storage media, laser diodes and image sensors. 

The firm said later that production would be restarted gradually. 
Chipmaker Kioxia said some production equipment at a factory in Iwate prefecture stopped automatically after shaking caused by the quake was detected.

LONDON (Reuters) -Swiss Re, the world's second biggest reinsurer said it would no longer insure most new oil and gas projects following mounting pressure on big business to do more to help the world cap global warming.
Last year, the International Energy Agency report said no more new oil and gas fields should be developed if a target of capping planetary warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above the pre-industrial average by mid-century is to be met.
In its annual sustainability report on Thursday, Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) said it would no longer insure projects that get the go-ahead from their parent company from 2022, unless the company has an independently verified, science-based plan to reach net-zero emissions.
By 2025, Swiss Re said it wanted half of its overall oil and gas premiums to come from companies aligned with such a net-zero by 2050 plan, and by 2030 all its clients in the sector should have done so.
Also, from 2022, the company said it will no longer insure companies or projects with more than 10% of their production in the Arctic, apart from Norwegian producers.
On the issue of treaty reinsurance, whereby it insures bundles of risk in a job lot, Swiss Re said it expected to finalise a policy for the oil and gas sector in 2023.
The shift by Swiss Re was an important signal from ""one of the world's ultimate risk managers,"" Peter Bosshard, global coordinator of NGO Insure Our Future, said.
""Oil and gas operations need to be phased out in accordance with climate science or they may become uninsurable by the end of the decade.""
Bosshard said the onus was on rivals Munich Re, Lloyd's and SCOR, which account for 26% of the global reinsurance market, to commit to even greater action ahead of their annual general meetings.

""The policy is not perfect yet and we encourage its peers to build on it to fully align with a realistic 1.5°C scenario,"" Lucie Pinson, director of Reclaim Finance, said.
""As the IEA Net Zero Roadmap shows, this should mean drawing a red line against fossil fuel expansion and excluding both projects and companies that cross that line well before 2025.""

747,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 08:22AM ET</span>",China's factories opt for isolation bubbles to beat COVID curbs and keep running,"By Josh Horwitz and Martin Quin Pollard
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - To keep factory lines open in the face of COVID curbs Chinese firms are asking workers to eat, sleep and work in bubbles isolated from the wider world, sterilising premises as often as three times a day and testing for COVID daily.
Dubbed ""closed-loop management"", this approach has been part of China's efforts over the past two years to keep local transmission extremely low by global standards.
It was used for example at the Winter Olympics in Beijing to seal event personnel off from the public. 
It is now being touted by local Chinese authorities as a solution for companies who want to stay open as the country tackles its biggest outbreak in two years. 
Many of the harshest curbs have been applied in manufacturing hubs such as Shenzhen, Dongguan and Changchun, forcing numerous factories to shut. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn said it was able to restart some production at its campus in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen after it put such an arrangement in place. 
State media outlet Securities Times said on Thursday that television maker TCL Corp, chip fab Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, and Apple supplier Shenzhen Deren Electronic Co Ltd were keeping factories in affected areas open via closed loop systems. 
The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is planning a similar arrangement for its Shanghai factory, Reuters reported on Wednesday. 
On Thursday, Shenzhen, which has suspended buses, subways and all non-essential economic activity in a week-long containment programme, said it will allow firms to resume work in an ""orderly"" manner.
TOUGH REQUIREMENTS 
Creating such bubbles, however is not easy. Foxconn said it could only apply the bubble on campuses that included both employee housing and production facilities. 
Jin Yong, a factory worker in Shenzhen, told Reuters he had not stepped out of the electronics plant where he works since late February, when they started operating a ""closed-loop"" system for more than 2,000 workers. 
While it was slightly depressing to not be able to leave for a walk, he said he felt that it was a good approach to battle COVID. 
""We have to take a COVID test every day. And every day we have to maintain a special code showing that we’ve been tested within 24 hours,"" he said, describing the factory site as self-sufficient with a barber shop, canteen and fruit shop. The workers live in dormitories. 
Companies also need to strictly follow government guidelines for how to manage staff inside the bubble. A notice from the Dongguan city government on Tuesday said firms had to control the flow of people on their sites to prevent large groups from gathering and to stop people from dining in the canteens. 
One industrial zone in Dongguan went a step further by telling firms that they needed to cap the number of workers per 100 square metres at 10 people and sterilize factory floors, elevators and canteens at least three times a day. 
But few factories will be able to meet such requirements, said Shenzhen-based Renaud Anjoran, CEO of quality control firm Sofeast Ltd, estimating that only hundreds out of the tens of thousands of factories in Shenzhen would have the resources to conduct closed-loop management. 

He was not optimistic, for example, for small plants like his own of about 150 workers that was asked to suspend work on Wednesday evening. He worries losses could amount to ""millions of yuan"" if production stops for more than two weeks.
""At least in 2020 some of the down time was during Chinese New Year, and we were forced to delay the re-opening a bit. This 2022 lockdown is much, much worse for manufacturers.""

748,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 08:13AM ET</span>","In break with Toshiba board, director says to back plan that could open door to buyout","By Makiko Yamazaki
(Reuters) - A Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp independent director broke ranks with the company board's public stance on Thursday, saying he would back a shareholder proposal at next week's extraordinary meeting that could pave the way for a potential buyout deal.
The comments from American Raymond Zage, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and hedge fund manager, mark the latest twist in a long-standing fight between the 146-year-old Japanese conglomerate and its large number of foreign shareholders.
Last week U.S. hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, where Zage was previously a managing director and remains an adviser, joined a chorus of investors who oppose the company's plan to break itself up by spinning off its devices business. 
Zage said in a statement he would vote at the March 24 extraordinary meeting for a proposal from Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners requesting that the company solicit buyout offers from private equity firms. Toshiba's board has said it opposes the resolution.
""It should not be difficult, nor time consuming, to obtain preliminary bid indications and that some level of additional information could be provided to shareholders for the purposes of comparing a potential privatisation with the potential value of the proposed spin-off plan,"" he said.
Zage, one director in an eight-member board, said he believed he was one of the top 100 shareholders in the company and owned more shares than the rest of the board and senior management combined.
Toshiba said in response to Zage's statement that there is no change in the board's opinion opposing 3D's proposal. ""This statement was issued by Zage as an individual and is not a statement from the company,"" it said.
Toshiba will continue to make every effort to gain shareholders' support for the management-backed break-up, it added.
3D in January submitted the proposal that Toshiba solicit buyout offers, saying that a five-month strategic review leading to the break-up plan was flawed as a take-private option was never fully explored. 
3D is Toshiba's second-largest shareholder with a stake of over 7% while Farallon is Toshiba's third-largest with a holding of more than 6%.
Glass Lewis, an influential proxy advisory firm, has backed 3D's proposal but rival Institutional Shareholder Services has not recommended voting for it even though it is opposed to the spin-off plan.
Foreign hedge fund shareholders own an estimated 30% of Toshiba combined. 

Toshiba CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa resigned this month, a sudden departure that came after sources said the spin-off plans had also sparked division with the company in addition to fuelling shareholder anger. Tsunakawa, however, remains chair of the board.
Toshiba shares finished 1.5% higher, underperforming a 3.5% climb for the broader market.

Investing.com – Accenture (NYSE:ACN) stock jumped 4.5% in premarket trading Thursday as the company raised its annual guidance one more time after grabbing market share in the second quarter.
The company now sees annual revenue rising 24-26% in local currency and profit per share between $10.61-$10.81. At the time of the last revision in December, revenue growth was seen at 19-22% and EPS at $10.32-$10.60.
The company saw record quarterly bookings in both consulting and outsourcing of $10.9 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively, riding on increasing appetite among clients for spending on technology as they pivot to digital. Demand for cloud and security-related services, Accenture’s forte, was strong in the recent quarter through February.
The company’s clients include more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500 companies across communications, media, and technology as well as financial services industries.
Geographically, U.S. grew the most, at 26%, followed by Europe at 24%. Growth markets also rose a strong 22%.
Revenue in the second quarter topped $15 billion, rising 24% in U.S. dollars and around $300 million above the top end of the company’s guided range of $14.30 billion-$14.75 billion.

750,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 07:45AM ET</span>",SoftBank-Backed Oyo Said to Weigh 50% Smaller IPO as Markets Sag,"(Bloomberg) -- Oyo, the high-profile affordable lodging startup that filed for an initial public offering last year, is considering slashing its fundraising target by half or even shelving the debut, according to people familiar with the matter.
Faced with headwinds including slumping stock markets, Oyo-operator Oravel Stays Ltd. could clip its Indian IPO from the nearly $1 billion initially sought to half that, the people said, declining to be identified discussing internal matters. It’s considering also halving its expected valuation from the $12 billion originally targeted, they said. Oyo could even decide to suspend its IPO plans, the people said.
The deliberations underscore investors’ reluctance to buy into IPOs during a time of extraordinary market turmoil. The Airbnb Inc.-backed startup had already considered lowering its target valuation to $9 billion earlier this year after Paytm’s disastrous debut -- but that was before the Ukraine conflict and inflationary concerns ignited a global tech selloff.
Oyo, backed by investors including Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Group Corp. (T:9984) and Sequoia, made preliminary filings in September aiming for an IPO in early 2022. Nearly six months later, the initial documents, known as a draft red herring prospectus, have yet to get a green light from India’s stock market regulator.

None of Oyo’s IPO-related deliberations have proceeded far enough to come up for formal discussions or approval at the board level, the people said. Oyo representatives didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Oyo’s hesitance is emblematic of a cooling in India’s unicorn-minting technology industry, where nearly 50 startups got venture funding at valuations of $1 billion or more in 2021 alone. This year, there have been signs of slower fundraising and contracting valuations, as investors harbor second thoughts.
The most palpable slackening has been in the IPO arena, after tumbling stock prices dampened investor enthusiasm.
SoftBank, Oyo’s largest backer and one of the most prolific dealmakers in Indian startups, is now taking a more cautious approach with its investments there. The Japanese firm, which was bullish throughout last year, has held back funding for at least two startups after handing out term sheets, or agreements that spell out the terms and conditions of an investment, according to a person aware of the matter.
The two startups operated in the e-commerce and software-as-a-service segment, where valuations have diminished dramatically.
If Oyo decides to modify its IPO terms drastically, it will need to file a fresh DRHP, one of the people said.
Many other startups that have received approval for their IPOs have chosen not to proceed. Delhivery Ltd.’s nearly $1 billion IPO hasn’t moved ahead, and neither has API Holdings, which operates online pharmacy Pharmeasy. Delhivery and API received regulatory approvals in January and February, respectively.

French cloud computing services provider OVHcloud confirmed in a statement that it had joined the complaint against Microsoft. A spokesperson for the company declined to give the names of the two other European plaintiffs.

The news comes about a week after Toyota said it would scale back domestic production by up to 20% during the months of April, May and June to ease the strain on suppliers battling shortages of chips and other parts.
""It is still difficult to foresee the situation several months ahead, and there is a possibility the current plan will be revised downward,"" the company said in a statement.
Average monthly global production for the period from April to June would be about 800,000, Toyota added. 
Its global vehicle production will be down 10% in May and 5% in June from previous estimates at the beginning of the year, said Toyota executive Kazunari Kumakura.
The shortages have led the automaker to repeatedly change its production plan, frustrating suppliers and prompting President Akio Toyoda to call the interval from April through June an ""intentional cooling off"" period. 
Apart from the persistent chips shortage, Toyota faces a number of challenges.
Curbs against COVID-19 forced it to suspend a joint venture with China's FAW Group in the northeastern city of Changchun.

The automaker also cited logistical hurdles for suspension at a plant in Russia amid political uncertainty sparked by the Ukraine invasion, which Russia calls a special operation.
These factors were not reflected in the April-June global production plan, Kumakura said, adding that while Toyota had not yet suffered specific impacts from the Ukraine crisis, it would look into short- and long-term risks.

760,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 06:35AM ET</span>","Investors adjust as Fed hikes, worry about clouds on horizon","By David Randall, Davide Barbuscia and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are racing to work out how much monetary policy tightening the economy can handle as the U.S. Federal Reserve embarks on its rate-hike cycle, with some expecting an even steeper path ahead as others fret over possible missteps.
The Fed's first rate hike since 2018 on Wednesday was baked into markets, but the central bank surprised by projecting the equivalent of a quarter-percentage-point rate increase at each of its six remaining policy meetings this year. 
Hiking rates should tame sky-high inflation that is biting at people's ability to purchase everyday items, but it runs the risk of crimping growth and tipping the economy into recession. Still, Fed Chair Jerome Powell expressed confidence the economy could flourish despite less accommodative policy. 
""The Fed (is) trying to right the ship,"" said Andy Kapyrin, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic. ""My expectation is that they will get more hawkish as the year goes on, especially if inflation stays high."" 
Kapyrin is increasing overweights in value stocks – shares of comparatively cheap, economically sensitive companies that tend to thrive in an environment of strong growth and higher rates – as well as floating rate bonds he expects to benefit from rising borrowing costs. 
The speed at which the Fed is moving drew some comparisons to former Fed chairman Paul Volcker, who sharply raised rates in 1979 in a fight to tame double digit inflation, with analysts at research firm Bespoke saying Powell was having a ""mini Volcker moment.""
Still, the clarity on the Fed's projected rate hike path and the central bank's insistence that the economy is strong enough to handle a cocktail of policy tightening, higher inflation and volatile commodity prices in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, reassured some.
""The big overhang for the market was the uncertainty as to what the Fed was going to do, and now we have a rate path,"" said Jay Hatfield, portfolio manager at Infrastructure Capital Advisors. 
The benchmark S&P 500 closed up more than 2%, a move that some investors took as relief that the Fed has kicked off its inflation fight.
The pace of rate hikes and balance sheet tightening could, however, weigh on the economy. Powell said details on reducing the Fed's nearly $9 trillion balance sheet could be finalized in May.
""It is good that the Fed left sort of unclear when they will start reducing their balance sheet,"" said Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at FS Investments. ""We have real concerns over whether the markets can continue to function if the Fed starts to drain their balance sheet more aggressively.""
EYES ON RISK
Some concerns over future growth were apparent in the Treasury market, with yields on some shorter-dated Treasuries rising above longer-dated ones, a sign that investors see economic risks ahead.
The yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes flattened, the yield gap between five-year notes and 30-year bonds shrank to the smallest since October 2018 and yields on five-year notes rose above those on 10-year notes, showing an inversion for the first time since March 2020. 
An inverted yield curve has been a reliable predictor of past economic downturns in key parts of the curve, although the closely-watched parts of the curve most associated with recession have not yet flipped. 
""The longer that curve stays flat or begins to flatten, or if it does start to invert throughout the curve, that would be a concern of ours,"" said Joe Bell, chief investment officer at Meeder Investment Management.
Fed policymakers began to discount the new risks facing the global economy, marking down their gross domestic product growth estimate for 2022 to 2.8%, from the 4% projected in December. 
""They don't have a great record in engineering 'soft landings',"" said Matthew Nest, global head of active fixed income at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors, who expects the economy to shrink in the first half of 2023.

There could however be relief if commodity prices ease, said Tony Rodriguez, head of fixed income strategy at asset manager Nuveen, who is moving into low quality mortgage bonds and high yield corporate bonds. That could take pressure off the Fed to tighten rates as much as it has projected, he said. 
""If we have learned anything over the past two years it's that the Fed's economic projections are more often than not a little bit off base,"" he said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M is selling external fashion brands on its core brand's hm.com website for the first time in Sweden and Germany, with the intention of adding more brands and markets. 
Taking on fashion online marketplaces such as Zalando, Asos and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), H&M started in February by expanding its offering in home market Sweden, as first reported by Fashion Network.
""Customers are now able to shop from more brands in the H&M Group family, as well as from a curated selection of other fashion brands such as Lee, Wrangler and Kangol, among others,"" a spokesperson told Reuters by email.
""We launched the concept in Germany in March. We will continue to add brands going forward and expand the concept to other markets.""
Some of H&M's smaller and newer independent chains, such as & Other Stories and Arket, sell external brands, mainly accessories and shoes. 
The H&M chain, which accounts for the bulk of the group's business, has previously only offered beauty products of external brands. 

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic H&M was struggling to contend with declining footfall at the core H&M brand's physical stores in the face of tougher competition, not least from online platforms. 
The H&M spokesperson said it had also introduced a second-hand offer at hm.com in Sweden.

Investing.com – Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR) stock traded 0.3% higher in premarket Thursday on plans to raise potash output to capture demand currently unserved due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
The world's biggest fertilizer producer plans to increase potash output by nearly 1 million ton this year to about 15 million ton in response to the uncertainty of supply from Eastern Europe.
Potash is a key input required for producing nitrogen-containing fertilizers, and Russia and Belarus are the world's second and third largest producers of the commodity after Canada. The potash fertilizer production is concentrated in a few countries. And with supplies from east Europe ruled out due to the sanctions on Russia and Belarus,  Nutrien  sees scope to capture additional market share.
The majority of the additional volume is expected to be produced in the second half of the year, the company said.
Nutrien’s 2022 potash production is expected to increase by nearly 20% compared to 2020 and account for more than 70% of global production added over this period, according to the Canadian firm.
“We expect a small increase in our 2022 capital expenditures and will be hiring additional employees across our network of low-cost potash mines in Saskatchewan,” it said.
Nutrien said it will update on its outlook and 2022 guidance in the first quarter earnings release in May.
Reports of  Canadian Pacific  Railway (NYSE:CP), which moves potash fertilizer into the U.S., sending a lock-out notice to its employees are capping the gains in the stock. 
This happened after the transporter's talks with a union on wages and other issues failed, a move that could disrupt the supply of the commodity."

Investing.com – Ocado Group's (LON:OCDO) stock plunged 8% in London trading Thursday after Ocado Retail, the Group’s 50/50 online grocery joint venture with Marks and Spencer (LON:MKS), lowered its sales outlook for the current year.
The number of customer transactions grew in the first quarter to February 27 but a fall in basket sizes overshadowed that, reflecting softness in retail sales as more customers return to offices and shift to a lower stock level of groceries. 
The joint venture firm said it will now begin to cut costs across the business.
Ocado has lost 45% of its market cap in the last year as labor shortages, capacity constraints, and intense competition have capped its growth.
Rising raw material and food prices, surging energy costs, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict are also adding to the challenges of the company, reports said.
The JV company said it had increased some retail prices, where increased costs could not be mitigated.
Industry data published earlier this month showed British grocery inflation hit 4.3% in February, the fastest rate of increase since 2013, according to Reuters.
Annual revenue growth is now seen closer to 10% compared to the previous forecast of “mid-teens”. 
The average basket size in the quarter fell 15% to 124 pounds ($163). Average orders per week rose almost 12% to 367,500, while active customer numbers grew 31% to 835,000."

The lender has operated in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union 30 years ago and its business there - Russia's No. 10 bank by assets - contributed almost a third to the group's net profit of 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) last year.
Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month, banks with operations in Russia have been under pressure as investors fear writedowns, business interruption and slower economic growth.
""This unprecedented situation leads RBI to consider its position in Russia. We are therefore assessing all strategic options for the future of Raiffeisenbank Russia, up to and including a carefully managed exit from Raiffeisenbank in Russia,"" RBI chief executive Johann Strobl said in a statement.
Raiffeisenbank Russia said separately it will continue servicing its clients in Russia irrespective of a potential withdrawal by its Austrian parent. Such a move would be ""a measure of last resort"", it said.
Reuters reported this month that RBI was looking into leaving the country. 
At the time the bank said it ""does not have any plans to leave Russia"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has joined a group that sets environmental and social standards in mining as the world's No.2 carmaker steps up efforts ensure its raw materials are sustainable, especially in electric vehicles (EVs).
Big companies have come under increasing pressure from shareholders and consumers to meet stricter standards relating to the environment, social issues and governance (ESG).
VW is the biggest member company by revenue to join the 
Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA), the carmaker told Reuters ahead of an announcement later on Thursday.
Other carmaker members of IRMA include General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford.
""In many cases, it is not the Volkswagen Group itself that is going to purchase the raw materials,"" said Murat Aksel, VW's board member for purchasing. ""But we want to know where they come from and under what conditions they are mined and processed.""
IRMA, which launched in 2006, includes both buyers and producers of minerals, investors, labour unions, community representatives and independent experts. 
VW is making a huge push to ramp up EV output and has boosted spending in the area by around half to 52 billion euros, compared to the previous five-year rolling investment plan, it said in December.
Cobalt, a key component in EV batteries, has been in particular focus because the bulk of production comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has a large informal sector with a legacy of unsafe working practices and child labour.
VW is participating in a pilot project in Congo with a mine operator to test new certification standards developed by another organisation, CERA, Aksel added.
He said VW also supported a European initiative to develop domestic sources of supply for critical minerals, which has targeted rare earth magnets used in EVs and wind turbines as its top priority.

""The development of sustainable supply chains for raw materials is a core strategic goal for us. We believe that strengthening our European supplier network plays an important role in this,"" he said, without giving details.
In 2020, Volkswagen and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) launched a study to push for more ""sustainable"" mining in Chile of lithium, another key EV battery ingredient.

Airbus said it had no comment on market rumours or speculation.
""As a global company we are in constant discussion with our partners, customers and suppliers across the industry - these conversations are private in nature,"" Airbus said in an e-mail to Reuters.
Atos declined comment, reiterating its BDS cybersecurity business was not up for sale.
By 0810 GMT, Atos shares gained 3%, having risen as much as 4% in early dealings.
BFM, in its report, cited one source as saying Airbus had been looking into a potential acquisition of Atos over the last few weeks, driven by its interest in the field of cybersecurity, but added that at this stage, no outright takeover was on the cards.
""(Airbus CEO) Guillaume Faury believes that this topic (Atos) is too complicated given Airbus's interests,"" BFM cited one source as saying. 
The report added that the group therefore opted against buying Atos as a whole as it had no interest in acquiring the French firm's other activities. 

Last month Atos said its cybersecurity arm, BDS, was not for sale after sources told Reuters that French defence company Thales was working on a plan to buy the business, having approached private equity firms about exploring a joint offer and break-up.
Thales said at the time it would potentially be interested in any cybersecurity activities that were on sale, but that no discussions were under way with Atos.

LONDON (Reuters) -Hit by surging inflation and Russian invasion of Ukraine, European shares have sunk to their lowest level in a year on March 7, falling over a fifth from their January highs to end up in what investors consider a bear market.
Funds have dumped a record $20 billion of European equities in the past two weeks, including $13.5 billion just last week, according to data from funds tracker EPFR, backing out of what at the start of the year appeared to be one of leading bets for 2022.
But strategists and portfolio managers say market reaction had far exceeded the scale by which 2022 earnings forecasts have been trimmed and see as overblown fears of economic stagnation and high inflation, or ""stagflation"", gripping Europe.
For now, they just expect slower growth than earlier anticipated.
On Wednesday, the pan-European STOXX 600 index returned to where it opened at on Feb. 24 when Russian troops entered Ukraine, a sign that bets on Europe Inc were still on.
""We kind of agree with the 'flation' side of the stagflation but not the 'stag'"", said Nick Nelson, head of Global & European Equity Strategy at Swiss bank UBS. 
His team has almost halved its 2022 growth expectations for European earnings to 8% from the previous 15%, but does not see a worst case materialising at the moment and UBS says European shares have room to gain 7%.
Europe has been hit by the conflict the hardest because of its proximity and close business ties to the area. Russia accounts for 2-4% of sales for many leading European companies and is also a key supplier of natural gas. 
Data from Refinitiv I/B/E/S shows a spike in downward revisions of earnings forecasts for STOXX 600 companies, with outlook cuts now accounting for over 60% of all revisions. 
Negative tweaks to expectations now constitute over 60% of total revisions. 
While outright stagflation is considered unlikely, some like Jerome Schupp, fund manager at Prime Partners are factoring in slower economic growth and his firm has already diversified outside the financial and cyclical sectors.
But the outlook for profit growth is still upbeat with earnings seen rising during the four quarters of 2022 by 21.5%, 8.4%, 13% and 7.6% respectively, according to Refintiv I/B/E/S estimates.
While European Central Bank cut its 2022 growth target from 4.2% to 3.7% to reflect the war's impact, it would leave the euro zone still with a growth rate far exceeding how it performed on average over the past 20 years. 
""Euro zone growth is still trending above trend,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of the European equity strategy at  Barclays  (LON:BARC), adding that stock markets probably over-reacted. 
His team cut its 2022 profit growth forecast for Europe to 8% from 14% but does not see a repeat of the oil shocks of the 1970s which triggered deep recessions. 
JP Morgan strategists also see a decline in earnings as unlikely unless economic growth slows below 1%, well below the 3.2% rate now expected by their economists. 
Kasper Elmgreen, Head of Equities at French asset manager Amundi, said that while the recent sell-off hit European stocks across the board, companies' pricing power and ability to preserve margins will be key for their performance.

""If you are a company and your prices are very sticky, you don’t have ability to move them a lot, then wages go up 5-10%, and raw material prices go up, your earnings may disappear,"" Elmgreen said. 
""If you run a business with pricing power, like luxury or pharma, the customer is willing to pay that, and earnings will be more stable.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday voted to revoke authorization for Chinese telecom Pacific Networks and its wholly owned subsidiary ComNet to provide U.S. telecommunications services.
The 4-0 vote to revoke the authorisation first granted in 2001 is the latest move by the American regulator to bar Chinese telecommunications carriers from the United States citing national security concerns. The FCC said Pacific Networks and ComNet are indirectly and ultimately owned and controlled by the Chinese government.
Jeffrey J. Carlisle, a U.S. lawyer representing Pacific Networks, declined comment. In January, he told the FCC that Pacific Networks and ComNet are owned by CITIC Telecom International Holdings. 
The FCC says the carriers are ultimately controlled by CITIC Group Corp, a Chinese state-owned limited liability company.
Carlise's letter said the carriers ""engage in very limited and small scale facilities-based operations in the United States that do not pose national security concerns....The primary business of the companies is providing retail calling cards.""
The Chinese commerce ministry criticised the U.S. actions, and said China would adopt measures necessary to safeguard the legitimate rights of its firms. 
""The U.S. should stop the groundless crackdown on Chinese firms right now and the wrongdoings of politicizing trade and economic issues immediately,"" Gao Feng, a spokesman at the ministry, said during a regular press conference on Thursday. 
FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks noted the three-year commission effort to address Chinese telecom carriers. ""Taken as a whole, our actions have strengthened our national security,"" Starks said. 
In March 2021, the FCC found Pacific Networks and ComNet had failed to ""dispel serious concerns regarding their retention of their authority to provide telecommunications services in the United States.""
In January, the FCC voted to revoke a similar authorization for China Unicom (NYSE:CHU)'s U.S. unit to operate in the United States, citing national security concerns.

In October, the FCC revoked the U.S. authorization for China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) (Americas), saying it ""is subject to exploitation, influence and control by the Chinese government."" Chinese Telecom failed to convince a U.S. court to reverse the decision.
In 2019, the FCC rejected China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Ltd's bid to provide U.S. telecommunications services, citing national security risks.

771,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 04:30AM ET</span>","Analysis: After China avows market stability, investors want proof","By Samuel Shen and Kevin Buckland
SHANGHAI/TOKYO (Reuters) - China's top financial policymaker rescued stock markets from a bloodbath this week with a promise of stability, but plenty of investors reckon mere words will not restore lasting calm in an economy beset with multiple large risks.
Hong Kong markets, which have borne the brunt of the brutal selloff in Chinese stocks, rallied fiercely after Vice Premier Liu He's assurances on stability, regulatory clarity and monetary easing.
Investors worried by more sombre concerns, chiefly around a potential blowback on China from its dealings with sanctions-hit Russia and a spike in domestic COVID-19 cases that threatens to disrupt economic activity, weren't convinced. 
Alan Song, chairman of Harvest Capital, a Chinese private equity firm, likened the rally in stocks to drowning investors clutching at straws, and expects the rebound will be short-lived because fundamental reasons for the rout remain.
""Hoping that a speech can change market trends, is like expecting a WeChat message can change the world,"" Song said, referring to a popular Chinese social messaging app.
China needs to earnestly resolve Sino-U.S. antagonism and improve its anti-virus strategy, as ""trillions in market value wiped off is a colossal loss that requires serious reflection,"" he said.
Liu's speech caused the Hang Seng index to leap from 2008 lows and clock a massive 2-day rally. Stocks of sectors targeted in China's regulatory crackdown, mainly technology, have bounced.
The decline in stocks this year had wiped out about $1.3 trillion or 17% of China's main CSI300 index market value from January through Tuesday. Even after the rally, Chinese stocks markets remain the world's worst performers this year, after Russia.
As proof of the lack of investor conviction, Sat Duhra, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, points to the narrowness of the rally, even within Chinese markets. 
The bounce in China also failed to enliven stocks such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Australian miners, whose fortunes are linked to China.
""I certainly wouldn’t be brave enough to be adding to China today,"" Duhra said on Wednesday. 
Duhra says he senses a change in the sentiment toward China, driven not just by concerns that China's close ties with Russia will draw Western ire, but also a host of problems such as power outages, property sector woes, rising household debt and an ambitious growth target.
""There's a lot of things that you could put together and say, this doesn't look very good,"" he said. ""Those issues have not gone away.""
SHOW AND TELL
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts noted how various ministries had sprung into action after Liu's speech at a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a regulatory body under the State Council, which is China's Cabinet. 
State-run Xinhua news agency reported the finance ministry was putting a plans on hold for a trial property tax this year. 
China's securities regulator said it would strive to reach an agreement with U.S. counterparts on cooperating over the audit of Chinese firms as soon as possible. As a result, U.S.-listed shares of JD (NASDAQ:JD).com and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) notched their biggest daily percentage advances as they appeared at less risk of being delisted by New York exchanges.
Yin Peixin, an investment manager at RBH Asset Management in Shanghai, said despite the immediate boost to market sentiment, Liu's remarks won't change the course of the Sino-U.S. conflict, or China's worsening coronavirus situation.
""I think Sino-U.S. decoupling is inevitable. It's just a matter of time,"" Yin said.
The Ukraine crisis was also forcing companies to take sides, deepening geopolitical rifts, and rhetoric wouldn't stop the spread of the coronavirus, he said.
Yuan Yuwei, a fund manager at hedge fund house Water Wisdom Asset Management, said the rebound won't reverse the trend of global investors exiting China stocks to avoid the rising risks Beijing could also face sanctions.

""China is being forced to pick sides"" in the Ukraine conflict, said Yuan, who still holds short positions in Chinese tech firms such as Meituan and Li Auto.
For a global investor, ”if you own a lot of China holdings, of course you're worried, as China and Russia are both seen as rivals by the U.S.,"" and the fear is deepened by what you've seen happen to Russian assets, he said.

Global markets surged overnight as traders hailed China's pledge to support its economy, chased an elusive breakthrough for a ceasefire in Ukraine and saluted a hawkish interest rate lift-off by the U.S. Federal Reserve. 
Yet, despite the positive mood this morning, the market turmoil triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine isn't going away. 
A wild spike in nickel prices which left traders facing billions of dollars in losses continued to reverberate through commodity markets with the London Metal Exchange halting trades again on Wednesday.
""What a mess. It's embarrassing, disorderly doesn't even begin to describe it,"" was how one metals trader commented on the chaotic reopening of nickel trading at the LME.
Oil markets are also gyrating wildly with prices bouncing up and down the symbolic $100 level after last week's frenzied rally which pushed Brent crude briefly to a 2008 high of $139 a barrel.
This morning, prices are up again after the International Energy Agency said markets could lose three million barrels per day of Russian crude from April and Britain's Boris Johnson failed to secure a pledge to ramp up production from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Foreign exchange markets made counter-intuitive moves with the U.S. dollar index falling after the Fed projected said its policy rate would hit a range between 1.75% and 2% by year's end in a newly aggressive stance.
For all the cheer resonating across U.S. stock markets following the Fed's announcement, the word 'recession' came in with a disturbing recurrence among analysts giving a quick take on the monetary tightening. 
Today, investors brace for another hike from the Bank of England and may feel perhaps more reluctant to chase a breakthrough in Ukraine peace talks after President Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin ""a war criminal"" which the Kremlin said was ""unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric"".

773,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 03:53AM ET</span>",Europe Stocks Open Slightly Higher as Post-Fed Rally Fades; BoE Meeting Eyed,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- European stock markets opened mostly higher on Thursday as the sharp relief rally that followed the Federal Reserve's first interest rate hike in over three years faded. 
By 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the Euro Stoxx 50 was up 0.2% while the broader Stoxx 600 was up 1.8 points, or 0.4%. They had risen 4% and 3% respectively on Wednesday, as the U.S. market action amplified a movement that had begun with growing hopes of a deal to stop Russia's war in Ukraine. The biggest gains were seen in Spain's IBEX, up 0.7%, while Italy's FTSE MIB lagged, staying largely unchanged. The German DAX rose 0.1% while the FTSE 100 rose 0.5%.
The Fed raised the target rate for fed funds by 25 basis points as widely expected, and indicated it will raise rates at least another six times this year and continue tightening into 2023, in addition to selling off its bond portfolio. The market had largely discounted that scenario and took comfort from the Fed's projections that it could tighten without causing a recession. Some analysts cast doubt on that optimism, as did the bond market, where the yield curve flattened considerably - a development that typically signals an economic slowdown in the future.
Thursday is likely to be dominated by central bank action in Europe, with the Bank of England widely expected to raise its key rate by another 25 basis points to 0.75%. In addition, the European Central Bank will hold an annual conference at which President Christine Lagarde, chief economist Philip Lane and board member Isabel Schnabel will all speak.
European currencies rose after the Fed's action on Wednesday having had a rough couple of weeks since the outbreak of the biggest war in Europe since 1945, an event that is likely to hit the European economy much harder than the U.S. one. The euro was up 0.2% at $1.1051, while the pound was up 0.2% at $1.13175.  In Russia, meanwhile, the ruble continued to strengthen, rising over 3% to a two-week high of 104.27 against the dollar. 
Markets have grasped at every sign of peace in eastern Europe, even though it is far from clear that the current talks can deliver that. The U.S. agreed on Wednesday to send an extra $1 billion in military assistance after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy begged Congress to neutralize Russia's air operations in the country. U.S. President Joe Biden also called his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a 'war criminal', a step that could complicate future negotiations. In addition, China - seen by many as the one country capable of persuading Russia to end the war - again refused to condemn the invasion. 
At a corporate level, U.K. supermarket and logistics group Ocado (LON:OCDO) fell 8.0% after it posted a decline in first-quarter revenue, while German steelmaking and engineering group Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) also fell by 8% after warning that the plan to spin off its steel division has been put in doubt by events in Ukraine. The company said it still believes a spinoff is the best course of action.
There was more downbeat economic news from the car sector. EU car sales fell 6.7% in February according to industry association ACEA, and the hit to European car production since the start of the war suggests that worse is to follow in March.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 03:01AM ET</span>",Russia sanctions pierce luxury jet world's ultra-private bubble,"By Allison Lampert
(Reuters) -The gleaming, late-model European jet for sale was a rarity in the hot market for second-hand corporate aircraft.
It was only after aviation lawyer Amanda Applegate's client did some additional digging that they discovered the aircraft, while not registered in Russia, was in fact Russian-owned. 
For that buyer, it was a deal-breaker, said Applegate, a partner at U.S.-based Soar Aviation Law, as the West imposes sweeping sanctions in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine.
The private jet world is on high alert to avoid doing business with Russia at a time when a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account run by a Florida teenager, @RUOligarchJets, has focused popular attention on the fugitive luxury fleets of the ultra-rich.
""When I look at compliance, it's like a taco, wrapped in a burrito, wrapped in a chalupa,"" said an executive at a business jet manufacturer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
According to European data research and consulting company WINGX, there are only about 100 business jets on the Russia Register. Yet about 400 corporate aircraft flew frequently from the country last year, raising questions over the true extent of Russian control of the fleet. 
""We think that a good proportion of the 400 are owned by Russia-based individuals or entities,"" said WINGX managing director Richard Koe. 
Worried planemakers are handing out questionnaires and doing extra vetting to make sure parts shipped to repair centers outside Russia aren't inadvertently sustaining jets covered by sanctions, the manufacturing executive said.
That's far from easy in the ultra-private world of corporate aviation.
Most Russian-owned business jets are registered outside the country and ownership is camouflaged behind layers of shell companies and trusts.
Some 5% of European business jets are registered in Russia, according to Jefferies analysts. But those actually owned by Russians could be up to triple that amount, analysts say. 
VETTING EXPORTS
One of the world's largest maintenance firms, Germany's Lufthansa Technik, has set up a task force and created an export approval process to avoid violating sanctions that ban technical support as well as shipments of parts to Russia.
""This means more complexity for our global supply chain processes,"" a spokesperson said.
Planemakers must be sure that a part shipped to a maintenance center won't later end up on an aircraft owned by a sanctioned person or entity. 
That's not such a problem when orders come in for parts for a specific aircraft, identified by its serial number. But in some cases the order could come from a maintenance center without mentioning a specific jet.
""I expect that the (manufacturers) and other suppliers will start to ask more questions so that they can vet the end-users for parts exports to certain countries,"" said aviation lawyer Jonathan Epstein, partner at U.S.-based Holland & Knight.
Canada's Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)'s Gulfstream are among the biggest suppliers of jets with Russian owners, according to analysts and brokers.
Bombardier, which has cut ties in Russia, said it is strengthening company procedures. 
It has suspended the accounts of some customers even though they are not directly covered by sanctions, and won't provide parts or technical support to anyone located anywhere if they use the aircraft in Russia, the Canadian planemaker said in a customer bulletin seen by Reuters.
Gulfstream did not respond to a request for comment. 
It is equally a headache for buyers. Like Applegate's client, many are avoiding all Russian-owned planes, not just those belonging to sanctioned owners. 
William Quinn, president of U.S. consulting firm Aviation Management Systems, said he expects to see more deals for European business jets come under scrutiny.
He recently represented a lender on a deal for a year-old Pilatus jet registered in Guernsey. That deal, too, fell through when the client discovered it was Russian-owned, Quinn said.

One broker has advised clients ""to run, don't walk"" from deals with any Russian for fear that more names will end up on blacklists, or that deals would worry lenders. The Kremlin has warned against anti-Russian feelings in the West.
""There is real concern the 'list' isn't yet refined and will continue to grow,"" said the broker on condition of anonymity. ""Much more risk of getting caught up in it than simply going in another direction.""

778,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 02:57AM ET</span>",Aston Martin launches 'swan song' V12 Vantage before going electric,"(This story was refiled to remove picture)
By Nick Carey
GAYDON, England (Reuters) - Aston Martin on Wednesday launched the final fossil-fuel version of its limited-run powerful V12 Vantage sports car, with every vehicle already snapped up before the British luxury carmaker starts its gradual shift to an electric lineup.
""This V12 Vantage is really a swan song,"" Aston Martin executive chairman and investor Lawrence Stroll told Reuters. ""There is a history of V12 Vantages at this company that goes back several decades and it will be the last one we make... before we move onto hyrbidisation and electrification.""
Aston Martin plans to launch its first fully-electric vehicle in 2025 and has said that as of 2026 all new car lines will have an electric option. 
Fictional secret agent James Bond's car brand of choice had a tough time after going public in 2018, failing to meet expectations and burning through cash. In 2020, it brought in fresh investment from billionaire Stroll.
The V12 Vantage and the DBX707, a luxury SUV, are the carmaker's first two new vehicles produced under Stroll.
Aston Martin has been incorporating technology into its cars from shareholder Mercedes-Benz, which increased its stake in the struggling carmaker in 2020.
The carmaker's petrol-powered V12 Vantage is limited to 333 units globally with a starting price of around $300,000. Stroll said the car was three times oversubscribed. 
Since 2007, Aston Martin has crammed its biggest engine into its smallest model to create the Vantage. 

The carmaker said the latest and last version ""offers an intoxicating combination of magnificent low and mid-range muscularity with searing top-end power"" and a top speed of 200 miles (323 km) per hour. 
Premium and luxury car sales soared in 2021, especially in key global markets like China and the United States, as pandemic travel restrictions left wealthy consumers with more disposable income.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2022 01:50AM ET</span>",Investors cheer China's pledge to support bruised property sector,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese property shares extended a rally on Thursday as the market cheered pledges by Beijing's top economic leaders to shore up the battered real estate sector amid growing pressures at home and abroad.
Vice Premier Liu He, China's economic tsar, said on Wednesday the government needs to reduce risks in the industry and proposed measures to facilitate a new development model for the sector.
In the meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee, a regulatory body under the State Council, Liu urged the roll-out of market-friendly policies to support the economy.
Liu's pledge received widespread support from other top institutions, including the central bank and securities and currency regulators.
That pushed up the Hang Seng Mainland Properties Index 14.8% by midday on Thursday, versus a 5.8% gain in the main Hang Seng Index. The sub-index had already jumped 14.7% on Wednesday.
""The shares that are bouncing a lot are also those that have dropped a lot previously, and they're still at low levels now,"" said Thomas Kwok, head of equity business of CHIEF Securities. ""Is the rally sustainable? That's a concern, because we may not see clear policies that will fundamentally change the liquidity problem for the developers.""
Sunac China, the nation's No.3 property developer by sales, jumped 47.5% to a one-week high, after losing nearly 40% this month on debt repayment concerns.
Top developer Country Garden and embattled China Evergrande Group both rose 22%.
The real estate sector, a key driver of growth, has struggled for months as Beijing's campaign to reduce high debt levels triggered a liquidity crisis among some major developers, resulting in bond defaults and shelved projects.
After Liu's comment, the banking and insurance regulator also said on Wednesday it would seek to stabilise land and home prices, transform the real estate sector and encourage mergers and acquisition loans for developers to purchase distressed assets.
The finance ministry later said China was putting a planned property tax trial this year on ice, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Trading in property stocks has been very volatile in recent months. They firmed early this year on expectations that more easing in the sector is coming, but plummeted this month due to continued worries over the liquidity risks in the companies.

Citi, however, cautioned a broad-based easing with flooding liquidity for property is nearly impossible, and, despite the encouraging tones from Wednesday, saw no substantial policy changes. 
""Recent marginal fine-tunes...are not game-changers,"" the investment bank said in a report. ""The best to expect for now is targeted downside protection for a few (company) names through coordination with local government and financial institutions.""

(Reuters) - Kanye West has been suspended from social media network Instagram for 24 hours after the rapper infringed the platform's policy regarding harassment, a spokesperson for its parent firm Meta Platforms Inc said.
The platform deleted content sent from the 44-year-old rapper's account that was in violation of its policies on ""hate speech and bullying and harassment,"" the spokesperson, Joe Osborne, told Reuters in an emailed statement.
West, who legally goes by 'Ye', will be restricted from posting, commenting or sending direct messages from the account for 24 hours, Osborne said, adding further action could be taken if he continued to violate policies on regaining control of the account.
Representatives for West did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
A report in entertainment industry publication Variety said West directed racial slurs at Trevor Noah, host of ""The Daily Show"" in an Instagram post after Noah discussed a row between West, West's former wife Kim Kardashian and her boyfriend, ""Saturday Night Live"" comic Pete Davidson.
The post has since been deleted, the report said.
Meta declined to provide details of the posts that violated its policy.
However, posts of West criticising actor D.L. Hughley and SNL writer Dave Sirius can still be seen on his profile.
Kardashian, a businesswoman and star of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians,"" filed for divorce a year ago, citing irreconcilable differences with West. The couple have four children ranging in age from 2 to 8.

After the divorce, West criticised the reality star's new relationship with Davidson on social media and publicly appealed to her to return to him.
A Los Angeles judge granted this month Kardashian's request to be declared legally single following nearly eight years of marriage to the rapper.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Exxon Mobil Corp and BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) said on Thursday they will go ahead with a project to boost gas output from their Gippsland Basin Kipper field off southeast Australia, which would help fill a looming gas shortage in the local market.
Exxon (NYSE:XOM)'s Esso Australia said the project would cost about A$400 million ($291 million) to extract an additional 200 petajoules (PJ) of gas over the coming five years, adding that about 30 PJ will be produced next year.
The country's regulators have warned that eastern Australia faces a gas shortfall from 2026, largely because the ageing gas fields in the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture, which has been the biggest supplier into the market for decades, are drying up.
Esso operates the joint venture in a 50-50 partnership with global miner BHP.
The extra production from the Gippsland Basin will come online ahead of five proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals, looking to serve the same market. Only one of those has begun preliminary construction work.
BHP's stake in the Gippsland Basin joint venture is set to go to Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum pending a vote of the Australian company's shareholders in May on a merger with BHP's petroleum business.
BHP will continue to contribute its 50% share of the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture's development spending for as long as it remains a stakeholder, a BHP spokesperson said.

Esso Australia also said it was advancing funding decisions to begin production from the Turrum field in Bass Strait, offshore Victoria.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn plans to use a COVID bubble arrangement that allowed its Shenzhen campus to resume production until at least Sunday, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. 
The world's largest contract electronics maker said on Wednesday it had restarted some production and operations at its Shenzhen campuses after arranging for some staff to live and work in a bubble, an arrangement requested by the local government as it battles the spread of COVID.
The ""closed-loop management"" system in its campuses there will last until midnight on Sunday, according to an internal document seen by Reuters and confirmed by two people familiar with the matter.
The company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has seen ""limited"" impact so far but some managers are worried about the bubble arrangement extending beyond Sunday as it meant the campus was not working at full production, one of the sources, who's not authorised to speak to the media, said.

Foxconn referred Reuters to its earlier statement, in which the company said it adheres to strict industry guidelines and policies issued by the Shenzhen government.
Only a small part of Foxconn's production for Apple's iPhone production in China takes place in the southern city of Shenzhen, with the majority happening in Zhengzhou in the central province of Henan, the two sources said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning, with the U.S. Federal Reserve betting that the U.S. economy will be able to weather its campaign against high inflation. However, the flatter U.S. Treasury yield could mean that economic growth will not be as resilient as hoped for.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 2.88% by 10:39 PM ET (2:39 AM GMT) and South Korea’s KOSPI rose 1.77%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was up 1.41%. Employment data for February 2022 showed that the employment change was 77,400, the full employment change was 121,900, and the unemployment rate was 4%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index soared 4.52%.
China’s Shanghai Composite rose 1.72% and the Shenzhen Component jumped 2.6%. The country’s more market-friendly stance, announced on Wednesday, boosted sentiment and an index of U.S.-listed Chinese stocks soaring 33% overnight.
U.S. shares recorded their best two-day gain since April 2020, after the Fed hiked its interest rate to 0.5% in its policy decision handed down on Wednesday. It also hinted at hikes at all six remaining meetings in 2022, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell saying the U.S. economy is “very strong” and can handle monetary tightening.
Gains for U.S. Treasuries were smaller, and the yield curve remained flatter. The latter led some investors to question whether the Fed will be able to curb inflation without triggering a sharp slowdown in growth, or even a recession.
“The overall message you got from the Fed today was very clear,” Deutsche Bank AG chief international strategist Alan Ruskin told Bloomberg. “They want financial conditions to tighten. The issue there is, can you soft-land this thing? Historically, when the Fed tightens, you do get some hard landing somewhere.”
The central bank will also begin allowing its $8.9 trillion balance sheet to shrink at a “coming meeting” but did not provide further details.
“It’s possible we’re going to see a yield curve inversion,” JPMorganAsset Management global market strategist Meera Pandit told Reuters.
That doesn’t necessarily mean a U.S. recession since bond market signals are being shaped by an unusual combination of Fed asset tapering, interest rate hikes, and balance-sheet reduction over a relatively short period, she added.
The Bank of England will hand down its policy decision later in the day. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel, Governing Council member Ignazio Visco, and Chief Economist Philip Lane will speak at a conference on the same day.
The Bank of Japan will hand down its policy decision on Friday.
Meanwhile, the commodity shock from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 continues to aggravate both price pressures and economic risks. The latest round of ceasefire talks between the two countries ended with Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying that a neutral Ukraine with its own army is a possible compromise.
However, Ukraine said it needs security guarantees, and U.S. President Joe Biden said his country would send Ukraine drones and thousands of anti-aircraft as well as anti-tank missiles."

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands, displaced more than 3 million people and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers.
After the United States and Europe cut it off from swathes of the global economy with retaliatory sanctions, Russia is facing its gravest economic crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union.
""There has been no halt to the work of these enterprises and there will be none. Everyone is continuing work,"" Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said, according to a government statement.
""I stress again - we will press on with the implementation of our MS-21 and SSJ-100 flagship projects,"" he said.
Borisov said Russia's military aerospace industry had thrived despite working under sanctions since 2014, when Crimea was annexed from Ukraine. But he acknowledged that the situation was more difficult for the civilian sector as so many projects depended on international cooperation.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia's once mighty aerospace sector was thrown into turmoil. Since President Vladimir Putin came to power in 1999, it has tried to claw back market share from Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus.
The Sukhoi Superjet 100, Russia's main domestic-made passenger jet, typically seats just under 100 passengers. Introduced in 2011, it was conceived as competition for Airbus, Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) and Embraer. 

The medium-range Irkut MS-21/MC-21, with a potential capacity of over 200 passengers, is due to enter service this year. First designed with U.S.-made engines, in December 2020 it flew for the first time with Russian-built turbofans.
Both planes are built by Irkut Corporation, part of United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), and the engines are built by United Engine Corporation, all of which are majority owned by Rostec, Russia's state aerospace and defence conglomerate.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As war in Ukraine drives up already high input costs, even firms with business models fine-tuned to Japan's deflationary economy are toying with higher prices, testing acceptance by consumers hardened by repeated affirmations of an elusive inflation goal.
High street price rises have broadened as wholesale inflation accelerates at record rates, with increases in the prices of commodities such as oil, for instance, reaching shop shelves in the form of more expensive plastic packaging.
In Japan, the knock-on effect has pushed companies used to nearly two decades of deflation to pass on costs more directly than ever before. On top of changing ingredients or reducing portion sizes, firms have given unusual price boosts to goods such as cooking oil, snacks and popular instant noodle brands.
Such is the inflationary pressure that some firms are moving away business models that assume persistent deflation, such as sticking to particular price points or favouring low-margin domestic fare over higher-quality imports.
""Companies that can add value to their products and services are able to raise prices more sustainably,"" said analyst Shota Sugihara at market researcher Teikoku Databank.
""It makes sense for companies to shift away from deflationary price-setting behaviour to boost profit and wages.""
Conveyer-belt sushi chain Sushiro, famous for making the delicacy more affordable with its 100 yen ($0.85) dishes, has expanded its range of 150 yen and 300 yen offerings.
""Many visitors stick to 100 yen dishes, so we ensure they're happy. But we're also seeing more customers willing to pay for finer sushi,"" said Koichi Mizutome, chief executive of Sushiro parent Food & Life Companies Ltd.
Small supermarket chain Benny Super is turning its back on a protracted price-cutting war by replacing as many as half of its products with higher-margin alternatives, such as culinary oil from Italy, Greece and New Zealand.
""We'll stock products not offered by other companies, such as rare or small-quantity goods. That's the strategy that works in times of inflation,"" said Benny Super owner Tomoya Akatsu.
Kobe Bussan Co Ltd has raised prices for most of the roughly 4,000 items it sells at its discount supermarkets.
About a third of those items are made at Kobe Bussan's domestic and overseas factories, giving the company stronger pricing power over those items than items from other food firms.
It also has a line-up of uncommon imported goods such as frozen waffles from Belgium and hummus from Jordan.
""We have raised price levels little by little from 10 years ago after realising that it would become harder to keep securing profit, and are doing it all out now on a really wide range of products,"" said Kobe Bussan President Hirokazu Numata.
URGENCY
The economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has only added urgency to the move away from business models tailored to deflation, with grain prices on the rise and oil prices hitting record highs, while sanctions against Russia complicate supply lines. Russia calls its action in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Though modest by global standards, Japan's core consumer inflation - which excludes volatile fresh food prices - is widely expected https://tmsnrt.rs/35ZneCt to speed up https://tmsnrt.rs/3tZqVzV from April toward the 2% target the Bank of Japan set in 2013 and reached only during the fiscal year ended March 2015.

In a January poll of 500 firms, 21% of respondents told Reuters they had raised prices, versus 15% in mid-2021.
Including those planning to raise prices, the ratio reached 64% from 61% in the previous survey, signalling more costs being passed on. In 2016, the ratio of those that raised or planned to raise prices was just 9%, while 7% planned cuts.
A survey by Teikoku Databank in February showed 41% of respondents in industries as varied as clothing, construction and chemicals were able to pass on rising raw materials costs.
Still, with increasingly frequent price hikes for a range of daily necessities and little sign of wage hikes, households may not have the capacity to splurge on higher-priced items.
Sceptics, including the Bank of Japan, question whether prices can keep rising, but fear surging fuel bills and slow wage growth will snuff out any burst of spending.

""For many customers, it's still the cheaper the better,"" said Sushiro's Mizutome. ""What we're doing is very cautiously, slowly trying to increase the amount each customer spends per visit.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) -Hyundai Motor Group launched a new automotive plant on Wednesday that will produce Indonesia's first locally assembled electric vehicle, part of President Joko Widodo's goal of developing a full EV supply chain utilising the country's mineral resources.
At the plant's inauguration on Wednesday, Jokowi, as the president is known, said the government was providing incentives and had removed red tape to try to boost investment in EV development.
""We need to be an important player in the global supply chain of electric cars,"" he said. 
""Our country has large mineral resources that can be used for development of electric cars.""
Indonesia is a major nickel ore producer, an important material for EV batteries. 
It also produces cobalt, also used for batteries, and has large deposits of bauxite and copper ores, which can be used for EV production, Jokowi said.
Downstream development of Indonesia's natural resources has been one of Jokowi's key economic goals to lure foreign investment and create jobs. 
By 2024, all EVs produced in Indonesia will use locally made batteries and other key components, he added.
Hyundai in 2019 said it would invest $1.55 billion up to 2030, with starting capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year, to be later expanded to 250,000 annually. 

The group's chairman Euisun Chung said the new plant would also be linked with a Hyundai-LG joint venture battery plant, which is scheduled to open in 2024.
LG Energy Solution (LGES) and Hyundai started construction of the $1.1 billion EV battery plant in September, which at its full capacity is expected to produce 10 gigawatt hours of battery cell power.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The chief executives of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Micron will testify on March 23 before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee as the industry and lawmakers make the case for $52 billion in U.S. subsidies for semiconductor chips manufacturing.
The chief executive of truckmaker Paccar (NASDAQ:PCAR) Inc will also testify at the hearing, which will look at vulnerabilities in semiconductor supply chains and the sector's connection with American competitiveness.
Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell announced the https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2022/3/developing-next-generation-technology-for-innovation hearing on Wednesday. Reuters reported the planned hearing earlier.
Two decades ago, the United States produced nearly 40% of all chips and today it accounts for only 12% of global production, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has said.
Last week, President Joe Biden met with executives of chipmakers including Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd, Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and other companies as part of an effort to push the U.S. Congress to fund subsidies to chipmakers to ease the semiconductor crunch.
The Senate in June and the House in February approved the $52 billion in subsidies in separate bills. ""Get it to my desk as quickly as you can,"" Biden said last week.
The bills take different approaches to addressing U.S. competitiveness with China on a wide range of issues, as well on trade and some climate provisions.
A persistent industry-wide shortage of chips has disrupted production in the automotive and electronics industries, forcing some firms to scale back production.
Cantwell said it was urgent to act, noting the chip shortage cost the global auto industry an estimated $210 billion in revenue in 2021 and a loss of production of 7.7 million cars.
""It's 30% to 50% cheaper to build a semiconductor foundry in Asia than in the United States, mostly because of foreign government investment... We can't wait,"" she said.
Intel said it was pleased to have the opportunity to ""advocate for the importance of investing in American semiconductor leadership.""
In January, Intel said it would invest up to $100 billion to build potentially the world's largest chip-making complex in Ohio.
Micron said in October it plans to spend $150 billion over the next decade globally on leading-edge memory chips manufacturing and research and development. Micron said funding from Congress ""would open the door to new industry investments.""

SEMI, an industry association, said in a letter https://www.semi.org/sites/semi.org/files/2022-03/SEMI_House_FABS_Act_Support_Letter_Mar_16.pdf to Congress that chips funding ""is vital to provide a foundational incentive for investments in domestic design and manufacturing facilities for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.""
Critics like Senator Bernie Sanders question why Congress would give subsidies to a large profitable industry.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Main Wall Street stock indexes and U.S. Treasury yields rose on Wednesday after the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates and laid out an aggressive plan for further increases to combat inflation.
In a widely expected move, the Fed announced a quarter percentage point increase in the overnight federal funds rate, lifting that key benchmark from its near-zero level. It was the first rate increase since 2018.
The U.S. central bank also said it expects to begin unwinding its massive holdings of government bonds and mortgage-backed securities at an upcoming meeting.
""The Fed did not rock the boat. They increased rates like expected, they did lower GDP forecast this year, and upgraded inflation expectations but none of that was a surprise,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ:LPLA) in North Carolina.
After the Fed announced its rate hike decision, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields reached 2.246%, the highest since May 2019, before retreating to 2.192%.
Two-year note yields rose to 2.002%, further flattening the closely-watched yield curve
On Wall Street, the Dow, benchmark S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closed higher after choppy trading following the central bank's moves. The gains were driven by stocks in the technology, financials and consumer discretionary sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.55% to 34,063.1, the S&P 500 gained 2.24% to 4,357.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.77% to 13,436.55.
""It was nice to see some follow through of yesterday's big gains. This is the first time we've had two big up days since the war started in Ukraine,"" Detrick said. ""With the Fed not rocking the boat, buyers stepped in to find values.""
The U.S. dollar fell. While the Fed unveiled a hawkish monetary policy stance, it did not deliver a tougher surprise that might have added to the greenback's weeks-long momentum.
The dollar index, which had gained 3% since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war on Feb. 24 and 10% since May, dropped as much as 0.6% on Wednesday.
European stocks closed at more than two-week highs as fresh talk of compromise in the Russia-Ukraine conflict boosted market sentiment just as China promised to roll out more economic stimulus.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 3.06%, while MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 2.76%.
Oil lost ground for the fifth time in the last six days as traders reacted to hoped-for progress in Russia-Ukraine peace talks and a surprising increase in U.S. inventories.
Benchmark Brent settled below $100 per barrel at $98.02, down 1.9%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude ended fell 1.5% at $95.04 a barrel.

Safe-haven gold rebounded after falling to more than a two-week low earlier in the session.
Spot gold added 0.5% to $1,926.57 an ounce, while U.S. gold futures fell 1.02% to $1,908.90 an ounce.

(Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed up more than 2% while the Nasdaq rallied almost 4% on Wednesday as investors shrugged off initial jitters following the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate increase and its signal that more hikes would be needed to fight inflation, ending the pandemic-era's easy monetary policy. 
The central bank announced a quarter-percentage-point increase in its benchmark overnight rate as was widely expected but the projection that its rate would hit between 1.75% and 2% by year's end was more hawkish than some investors said they had expected.
While the Fed flagged the massive uncertainty the economy faces from the war between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, it said ""ongoing increases"" in the target federal funds rate ""will be appropriate"" to curb the highest inflation the country has witnessed in 40 years.
While the major indexes pared earlier gains sharply and the S&P and the Dow both dipped into the red briefly after the Fed statement, the indexes steadied as Fed chair Jerome Powell spoke at a press conference.
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis said investors may be relieved the Fed is taking action against surging inflation. 
""Hearing the Fed finally 'say and act' to tackle inflation is somewhat calming for the investment community, and for Main Street struggling with higher inflation,"" he said. 
But other market analysts were concerned the aggressive rate hike projected could cause the economy to skid.
""This looks like a Fed that is intending on causing recession in order to stamp out the inflation problem and that is as short sighted as calling inflation transitory a year ago,” Scott Ladner, chief investment officer, Horizon Investments, Charlotte, North Carolina.
Joseph LaVorgna, Americas chief economist at Natixis in New York was also skeptical. 
“They’re going to try to be aggressive here in raising rates. I wish Jay Powell and company all the best of luck because they're not going to get anywhere near as they think, unless they’re willing to throw a lot of people out of jobs, because that's what's going to happen.  Because we're going to have a recession. This is a recession forecast,"" he said.
""I just don't see the Fed being able to engineer this kind of tightening for what right now is inflationary demand destruction.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 518.76 points, or 1.55%, to 34,063.1, the S&P 500 gained 95.41 points, or 2.24%, to 4,357.86 and the Nasdaq Composite added 487.93 points, or 3.77%, to 13,436.55. 
Of the S&P 500's 11 major industry sectors, the biggest gainers were sectors that had fallen sharply in a recent sell off with consumer discretionary and technology both finishing up more than 3% while communications services and financials added almost 3%. 
Only two of the sectors ended the day in the red with energy falling 0.4% and utilities losing 0.2%.
Historical data suggests tighter monetary policy has often been accompanied by solid gains in stocks. The S&P 500 has returned an average 7.7% in the first year the Fed raises rates, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) study of 13 hiking cycles since 1955.
Ahead of the Fed statement stocks had been rallying as talk of compromise from both Moscow and Kyiv on a status for Ukraine outside of NATO lifted hope on Wednesday for a potential breakthrough after three weeks of war.
The global mood had also been lifted earlier by China's promise to roll out more stimulus for the economy and keep markets stable.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.78-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 15 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 29 new highs and 93 new lows. 
On U.S. exchanges 15.82 billion shares changed hands compared with the 14.04 billion 20-day moving average.

(Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday signaled much faster interest rates hikes this year than they had expected just a few months ago, getting them to about 1.9% by the end of the year as they try to tamp down soaring inflation. 
Markets swiftly priced in their agreement, and then some, with trading in contracts tied to the Fed's target policy rate pricing in a rate of 1.93% by the end of 2022.
The last time the Fed raised rates as quickly as policymakers now expect was in 2004-2006. 
Back then, they lifted rates by a quarter of a percentage point at every meeting; since then they have gone much slower when tightening policy, amid weaker recoveries and sleepier inflation. 
Now, with inflation by the Fed's preferred inflation gauge running at three times its 2% goal, policymakers are ""acutely"" aware of the need to stabilize prices and committed to doing so, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday. 
But the exact tempo of the rate hikes remains in question, with markets pricing in a good chance of a half-point interest rate hike in May or June. 
Powell left the door well open to that possibility, saying repeatedly that if inflation did not cool off as expected, the Fed would accelerate its rate hikes. 
And indeed, seven of the Fed's 16 policymakers penciled in rate hike paths that would require at least one half-point increase, if not more, this year. 

""Clearly, the (Fed's policysetting) committee intended to send an aggressive signal of their resolve to rein in inflation and keep inflation expectations in check,"" wrote Regions' Chief Economist Richard Moody. 
The markets got the message.

The SPACs, ACI Corp III and Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Crest Investment Corp IV, had filed for their IPOs in March last year and were looking to raise up to a combined $1 billion. 
Moelis was among a number of high-profile investment bankers and investors, a list that includes Bill Foley and Chamath Palihapitiya, who rushed to take advantage of the lucrative dealmaking frenzy with SPACs.
However, interest in the market has waned, with shares of several companies such as Grab Holdings and BuzzFeed Inc, which merged with SPACs, tumbling after going public.
High rates of redemptions by SPAC investors have also dampened investor appetite, as has volatility in the U.S. markets triggered by rate hike concerns and geopolitical tensions.

A SPAC backed by Moelis, founder and chief executive officer of investment banking firm  Moelis & Co , has previously taken electric aircraft startup Archer Aviation Inc public. However, even on that deal, the companies had to amend terms to cut Archer's enterprise value by $1 billion.
SPACs are listed firms with no business operations but a pool of capital raised through an IPO that they use to merge with private companies, in deals that take the private companies public.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -China Eastern Airlines Corp on Wednesday asked the U.S. Transportation Department for approval to temporarily shift New York to Shanghai flights over COVID-19 measures.
The carrier said because of ""evolving coronavirus pandemic control measures in the Shanghai region, China Eastern has been instructed"" by Chinese aviation officials ""to divert Shanghai-bound passenger flights arriving from the U.S. to certain alternate airports in China.""
China Eastern asked approval starting March 31 to move existing twice-weekly Shanghai westbound passenger flights from New York to China's Fuzhou Changle International Airport through the end of April.
China's aviation regulator said on Tuesday it will divert 106 international flights scheduled to arrive in Shanghai to other domestic cities from March 21 to May 1 due to COVID-19.
The impacted flights include those operated by Air China (OTC:AIRYY), China Eastern, Shanghai Airlines, Juneyao Air and Spring Airlines, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said.

Shanghai, which reported five new local symptomatic transmissions and nearly 200 domestically transmitted asymptomatic carriers on Tuesday, said on Wednesday it has identified some key areas and would finish testing all people in those areas twice between Wednesday and Thursday.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc is suspending production at its Shanghai factory on Wednesday and Thursday, according to a notice sent internally and to suppliers, while the notice did not give a reason for the stoppage. Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Group China said it would resume production in Shanghai on Thursday after a 48-hour suspension.

(Reuters) - Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar has questioned 19 financial companies to clarify their investment policies on fossil fuels, his office said on Wednesday, showing the breadth of a review that could see firms losing state pension mandates.
Letters were sent to companies including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK),, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co among others ""that may be boycotting the fossil fuel industry,"" according to a statement and other material sent by a spokesman for the Republican state official.
Even if companies currently hold oil and gas investments today, some may be ""selling the hope of a 'green' tomorrow with promises to divest or reduce"" fossil fuel exposure, Hegar said in the statement.
Another round of letters will soon be sent to more than 100 other publicly-traded investment companies ""that appear to have one or more funds boycotting fossil fuels,"" according to Hegar's letter. 
Under a new state law, Hegar will draw up a list of financial companies found to boycott fossil fuels. Those firms could then be barred from managing state pension money. Hegar told companies they have 60 days to provide details.
At stake is access to state pension funds like the $197 billion Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which has about $2.5 billion with BlackRock for example.
Major investors face balancing acts as some pension funds and endowments move to divest from fossil fuel stocks over climate change concerns. High energy prices have helped keep other investors in the stocks however. 

A spokesman said Hegar was not available for further comment.
Representatives for BlackRock, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo did not comment. In a previous letter, BlackRock had argued to Texas officials that as a long-term investor in fossil fuel companies, ""we want to see these companies succeed and prosper.""

(Reuters) - Former CNN primetime host Chris Cuomo filed a request for arbitration on Wednesday, seeking $125 million in damages for alleged wrongful termination. 
The network fired Cuomo in December, following an inquiry into his efforts to help his brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had been accused of sexual harassment.
Chris Cuomo maintains that he was transparent with CNN about his role as his brother's confidant, and had ""no reason to believe"" that this violated the network's policies. He also claimed that former CNN chief Jeff Zucker and one-time marketing chief Allison Gollust had themselves provided advice to the former governor.
Details of Cuomo's assistance to his brother came to light in November, when the New York State Attorney General released materials related to its investigation of Andrew Cuomo.
The filing alleges the law firm CNN hired to investigate Cuomo's role in advising his brother, and a subsequent allegation of sexual misconduct that surfaced in a Dec. 1 letter, failed to give him an opportunity to explain what happened or address the woman's allegations, which he claims are false. 
Chris Cuomo's lawyers also argue that CNN was willing to bend its rules when it would benefit the network, citing the early days of the pandemic, in early 2020, when the network lifted its ban on Chris Cuomo interviewing his brother ""to exploit the Cuomo family relationship for its own purposes.""
""As CNN has admitted, network standards were changed in a calculated decision to boost ratings,"" said Bryan Freedman, one of Cuomo's attorneys, in a statement. ""When those practices were called into question, Chris was made the scapegoat.""

Representatives of CNN parent, AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia, declined comment.
Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for Zucker and Gollust, previously said that ""Jeff was never aware of the full extent of what Chris Cuomo was doing for his brother, which is why Chris was fired."" She said neither Gollust nor Zucker offered advice to the former governor. Both left the network after failing to disclose a consensual relationship.

Shares of the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder were up 1.8% at $90.10 in after market trading.
Demand for housing soared during the COVID-19 pandemic as buyers capitalized on record-low mortgage rates and remote workers sought more living space.
 Lennar  (NYSE:LEN)'s first-quarter revenue came in at $6.20 billion, ahead of analysts' estimates of $6.08 billion. Orders, an indicator of future revenue, rose 1% to 15,747 homes in the reported quarter, while deliveries increased 2% to 12,538 units.
The company said it expects second-quarter new orders of between 17,800 and 18,200 homes, barely hours after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.
""Both gross margin and net margin remained strong, even as materials costs and wages have increased, and home prices have continued to rise while remaining affordable even as interest rates have ticked up,"" Lennar Chairman Stuart Miller said.
Net earnings attributable to the company fell to $503.6 million, or $1.69 per share, in the quarter ended Feb.28, from $1 billion, or $3.20 per share, a year earlier.
Lennar faced volatility in its LenX platform, that invests in companies that focus on homebuilding, affecting its bottom line performance for the reported quarter.
Excluding the impact from its LENx investments, the company reported a profit of $2.70 per share. 

The pricing environment helped larger rival D.R. Horton post a 44.2% rise in quarterly profit last month.

(Reuters) - Foreign-listed Chinese shares rallied on Wednesday after Beijing vowed to keep markets stable, soothing overseas investors' nerves after a sell-off due to worries over differences between China and the West in the Russia-Ukraine war.
Remarks by China's Vice Premier Liu He that Beijing would roll out support for the economy and keep markets stable sparked a bounce from 21-month lows for local equities, fuelling a rally for U.S.- and Europe-listed Chinese shares.
In U.S. trading, JD (NASDAQ:JD).com jumped 39.4%,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) gained 36.8% and  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) rallied 56.1% in the biggest daily percentage advances ever for those shares. They fell to multi-year lows https://tmsnrt.rs/3u4Xtsk during Tuesday's sell-off. The iShares MSCI China exchange-traded fund rose 20.9%.
Similarly, gaming company NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) rose 25.7%, online video platform IQIYI jumped 50%, music-streaming company Tencent Music gained 29.3%, and mobile game publisher Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) advanced 47.6%, while Amsterdam-listed Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which owns a 29% stake in the Chinese tech giant Tencent, also gained sharply.
""It was an utter surprise to the market that this is something (China is) even thinking about,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. ""That's what made the rally so strong.""
Still, ""there's going to be a discount on all of these stocks for a while,"" he said, noting the recent JPMorgan Chase downgrade. Earlier this week, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) downgraded 28 Chinese stocks listed in the United States and Hong Kong.
""You need some follow-through here. It's not enough to have one Chinese official say something really positive,"" Meckler said.
Citibank's Asia-Pacific trading strategist in Hong Kong, Mohammed Apabhai, likened the moment to the Federal Reserve's market backstop in 2020 or then-ECB chief Mario Draghi's ""whatever it takes"" speech that staunched the eurozone crisis in 2012.
""It's not quite of that order of magnitude, but it's not that far away either,"" he said. ""It seems like China has realized that the need to do something to support the economy, something proper."" 
Chinese equities have seen severe selling pressure in recent days. Hong Kong stocks fell to a six-year low on Tuesday.
""Although it is still a volatile and somewhat opaque market, I think this is the right moment to look at Chinese stocks because valuations are good and macro data are recovering,"" said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan.
Frankfurt-listed depository receipts for Alibaba were among the most traded stocks on the Tradegate and Lang & Schwarz platforms, suggesting interest from German retail investors.
According to Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Research, which tracks retail flows, appetite for China ADRs has picked up the most since September 2021, with net purchases over the last 10 trading sessions topping $500 billion, the highest level in over six months.
Separately, China's securities regulator said it would continue to communicate with U.S. regulators and strive to reach an agreement on China-U.S. audit supervision cooperation as soon as possible. 
The speed at which Beijing has responded to this week's sell-off would suggest it does not want to let things drift out of control, said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould in London.
""Its key goal is common prosperity and stock markets matter because a lot of Chinese retail investors have money in equities, so their wealth is at stake if shares are plummeting in value,"" he said. 

Some analysts see Chinese stocks as a possible good long-term investment, following a torrid 2021 amid a crisis in the real estate sector and a severe regulatory crackdown on tech giants. 
The MSCI China index was trading at a valuation discount of more than 30% to world stocks and twice as much the 20-year average discount, per Refinitiv data.

Investing.com – Stocks surged after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, which was widely expected, as it signaled more of the same at future meetings.
The Fed raised rates for the first time in more than three years and indicated seven rate hikes for this year to bring inflation under control. The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% from a 0%-to-0.25% range previously.
More rate increases were appropriate, the Fed said, despite uncertainty caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine and a newly resurgent strain of Covid-19. The U.S. is fighting inflation that is running the hottest in four decades.
Powell said the Fed would like wage gains to slow as he pledged to do what could be done to tame inflation.
The increase also abruptly changes the Fed’s pandemic-era stimulus as widespread lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus put a halt on economic activity. Markets have been anticipating rate hikes for months, but the ebb and flow of concern about them has injected a newfound volatility in stocks.
Retail sales for February showed a gain in spending from the prior month, though a touch less than expected. Oil continued to fall on demand worries after several cities in China shutdown amid a new surge of Covid cases.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
2. Oil in focus
Crude oil prices continued their fall on news out of China — the largest oil importer — with the country facing Covid outbreaks in Shenzhen, a city of around 17 million. This space will continue to be closely watched this week.
The city, which is a manufacturing hub, has been put into a stringent lockdown. U.S. oil stockpiles rose more than expected in the latest week, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude oil inventories rose 4.345m barrels last week, compared with analyst's expectations for a draw of 1.375 million barrels.
2. Starbucks CEO 3.0
Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX)’s longtime former CEO Howard Schultz is coming back for a third time, to lead strategy as the coffee retailer faces a growing push by employees to unionize across the country.
Shares rose 5% on Wednesday and will continue to be in play on Thursday. Schultz is practically synonymous with the company he took over in 1987 and expanded internationally.

""Thyssenkrupp remains convinced that the independent positioning of the steel business offers very good prospects for the future. Nevertheless, a statement on the feasibility is at present not possible due to the current economic conditions,"" it said.
Although the group's sales in Russia and Ukraine are negligible at less than 1% of total sales, Thyssenkrupp said it expected business to be hit by the far-reaching macroeconomic and geopolitical consequences of the war in Ukraine.
Last month, Thyssenkrupp had said it expected free cash flow before M&A to break even for 2021/22.
""Against this background - in particular due to rising raw material prices - Thyssenkrupp AG (DE:TKAG) suspends its forecast for free cash flow before M&A for fiscal year 2021/2022,"" it said, adding the exact extent of consequences of the war were very uncertain.
Until the start of the war, business in the first and second quarter of the fiscal year were going according to plan, it said.

In February, Thyssenkrupp said it expected an adjusted EBIT between 1.5 billion euros and 1.8 billion euros and net income of at least 1 billion euros for 2021/22.
""In March, initial negative effects occurred primarily in the steel and automotive supply businesses,"" it said, adding the board still expected adjusted EBIT for the second quarter to be above the previous quarter.

804,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 04:35PM ET</span>",Air Lease says Russian law on leased jets could help in claiming insurance,"By Abhijith Ganapavaram
(Reuters) -A new Russian law on leased aircraft showed Moscow could ""confiscate"" planes and such a move might help it claim insurance, Air Lease (NYSE:AL) Corp said at a time when leasing firms risk writing off jets stranded in the sanction-hit country.
""It (the law) helps the insurance question because it demonstrates the intent to confiscate which is, I think, a critical aspect of our war-risk insurance,"" Air Lease chairman Steven Udvar-Házy said on Wednesday.
The new law allows Russian airlines to place airplanes leased from foreign companies on the country's aircraft register and has raised fears of a mass default by jetliners.
Global leasing companies have been scrambling to repossess more than 400 jets worth almost $10 billion from Russian airlines, who have mostly been unresponsive to demands for surrendering the jets.
That has thrown up the possibility of a long-drawn tussle between lessors and insurers, who could face multi-billion dollar payouts.
The law has prompted AerCap Holdings NV, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, to notify insurers of a potential $1 billion loss, according a report in The Insurer.(https:// AerCap declined to comment. It is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on March 30. Russia said the law aims ""to ensure the uninterrupted functioning of activities in the field of civil aviation"". Air Lease's finance head Gregory Willis also raised the prospect of the United States and European Union (EU) governments stepping in to support the leasing industry if insurance payments became an issue. ""I can very easily see government stepping in at some point in time as they've done,"" Willis said during a presentation at the J.P. Morgan Industrials Conference. Cowen analyst Helane Becker said she did not believe either the United States or the EU will step in to provide support. ""Large western lessors with exposure to Russia should be able to handle the situation without government support,"" Becker said. Shares of Air Lease closed 3.7% higher after it allayed fears arising from its exposure to Russia as all of its planes are with privately-owned carriers in Russia who prefer to continue doing business with western firms. 
The company also has ""very strong security deposits"" on leased aircraft, Udvar-Házy said. Air Lease, which had less than 5% of its fleet by net book value on lease to customers in Ukraine and Russia, said it was making ""good headway"" in cutting exposure to Russia.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Wednesday, led by tech as investors assessed the Fed’s plan to raise rates seven times this year after the central bank delivered its first hike in more than three years.
The S&P 500 rose 2.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.6%, or 518 points, the Nasdaq rose 3.8%.
The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% from a 0%-to-0.25% range previously.
The Fed is now forecasting its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% in 2022, well above the 0.9% forecast in December, pointing to about seven 0.25% rate hikes in total for this year.
“We had expected the dots to reflect 5 hikes in 2022 and 5 more in 2023, but instead they reflect a much steeper and higher trajectory for the funds rate than expected, with the median above neutral for 2023 and 2024,” Jefferies said in a note.
U.S. Treasury yields jumped sharply following the Fed decision. The 2-year U.S. treasury yield, which is sensitive to rate hikes, rose above 1.9%, pricing in the Fed’s seven rate hikes for this year.
The broader market was initially spooked by the steeper than expected path of rate hikes, but found its footing and regained the momentum seen ahead of the Fed decision following positive news concerning the Ukraine-Russia war. The Financial Times reported that Ukraine and Russia have drawn up a neutrality plan to end the war.
Financials, mostly banks, which benefit from rising Treasury yields, were the biggest gainers, up about 2%.

Energy was also in focus, weighed down by falling oil prices as investors digested positive Russia-Ukraine developments and surprise build in U.S. weekly crude stockpiles.

In an interview with regional TV channel, Bolsonaro said the possibility of replacing Joaquim Silva e Luna as Petrobras CEO exists, although he added ""everyone in the government can be replaced if they are not doing their job at a satisfactory level."" 
""So it doesn't mean that they will be replaced or that they won't be replaced"", said Bolsonaro. 
On Monday, Luna, a retired army general, said he would not leave the company despite facing criticism from Bolsonaro and others over a fuel price hike announced last week.
Bolsonaro appointed him to the job last year after his predecessor, Roberto Castello Branco, was fired due to a disagreement with the president over the company's pricing policy. 

Shares in Petrobras fell as much as 2.3% following Bolsonaro's statement, but were trading 1% down in late afternoon trading. The Bovespa stock Index rose 1.5%.
Petrobras, formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, did not respond to a Reuters request to comment.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Starbucks Corp's longtime former Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz will return to lead the company for the third time, taking over as interim CEO and driving strategy for dealing with a growing union drive at U.S. cafes. 
Current chief executive Kevin Johnson will retire, and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) will look for a new leader, the company said on Wednesday. Shares of the coffee chain were up 4.8%.
Schultz is practically synonymous with the company he took over in 1987. He expanded it into a coffee behemoth that made venti cappuccinos a global phenomenon. 
""Schultz is a revered leader and uniquely well-qualified to steward"" the company, said  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Lauren Silberman. Schultz will receive $1 of compensation.
The board expects to have selected a new leader by the fall, with help from executive search firm Russell Reynolds Associates, which it enlisted in 2021. Schultz did not make an appearance during Wednesday's annual shareholder meeting.
Separately, shareholders voted down a proposal for the company to produce annual reports on the prevention of harassment and discrimination in the workplace.
Johnson signaled to the board of directors a year ago that he might retire when the COVID-19 pandemic waned, he said in a company statement.
Johnson, 61, has been at Starbucks for 13 years, the last five as CEO.
Johnson steered the company through the worst of the pandemic, when cafes around the world had to shutter temporarily. While sales initially nosedived, they roared back as customers shifted to to-go and drive-thru and placed orders on Starbucks' mobile app.
The company also shifted its approach to building new cafes and is now adding more smaller stores with less room for seating and more emphasis on to-go orders in urban areas, while adding more drive-thru space in suburban locations.
Under Johnson's watch, Starbucks also lifted wages for employees several times - before most other global restaurant chains. Hourly starting pay will range from $15 and $23 by this summer.
UNION PUSH
The success of the mobile app, however, led to long lines and overworked employees in some areas. That barista burnout, as well as accusations by some workers that they were not getting enough protection from the virus at work, contributed to a surge of union organizing in U.S. locations. 
On Tuesday, a federal labor board accused Starbucks of unlawfully retaliating against two employees in a Phoenix, Arizona, cafe for trying to unionize their store.
The same day, a group of investors with $3.4 trillion under management urged the company to stop sending anti-union communications to its employees and to adopt a neutral policy towards unions.
The group, led by Trillium Asset Management and SOC Investment Group, said Starbucks risked damaging its positive reputation as a pro-employee brand by fighting the union.
Schultz has long said Starbucks did not need unions because it works so closely with employees, whom it calls ""partners.""
He has already had a run-in with Workers United, the union now representing employees at six stores. Employees at more than 140 stores in 27 states have asked for union elections in the last 7 months.
In November, Schultz spoke to employees who had been ordered to a large meeting with managers in Buffalo, where the first of Starbucks' 9,000 U.S. company locations were deciding whether to join the union.
In the meeting, Schultz likened Starbucks' pro-employee stance to Holocaust prisoners in concentration camps sharing blankets, according to media reports. The remarks led to backlash on social media.
""Schultz came to Buffalo to union-bust,"" wrote union organizer and barista Jaz Brisack on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) after the news on Wednesday. ""His takeover is another move in Starbucks' ideological war on unions.""
Johnson took the helm after Schultz resigned in 2017.
In a letter to employees on Wednesday, Johnson said that he has ""fond memories of making beverages together, laughing together, and sharing stories with one another.""
Starbucks will ""attract high-quality CEO candidates given its culture, global brand recognition and strong growth outlook,"" said BMO Capital Markets analyst Andrew Strelzik.
Because Johnson had previously worked in technology - at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) - the board's search is likely to be broad. However, ""we prefer to see an incoming CEO with strong consumer industry experience,"" Strelzik said.
The CEOs of Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc and Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING) Inc also resigned in the last two weeks.

Former Starbucks chief operating officer Troy Alstead, who left in 2016, ""was beloved by the investment community"" and ""ought to be on the short list"" for the CEO role, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said.
Several internal candidates could be considered, but ""unionization publicity could be a factor pushing the company to look externally,"" Charles said.

810,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 03:42PM ET</span>",Fed Lifts Rates for First Time in Three Years as Fight Against Inflation Begins,"By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the first time in more than three years and signaled seven rate hikes for this year to bring inflation under control.
The Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark rate to a range of 0.25% to 0.5% from a 0%-to-0.25% range previously. 
The start of liftoff on interest rates was widely expected as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said earlier this month that he would favor a 0.25% hike at the March meeting.
The March rate increase is expected to be followed up with several more hikes later this year, as Fed members have turned increasingly hawkish since December.
The Fed is now forecasting its benchmark rate to rise to 1.9% in 2022, well above the 0.9% forecast in December, pointing to about seven 0.25% rate hikes in total for this year, the Fed’s Summary of Economic Projections showed.
Ahead of the meeting, Wall Street was pricing about six to seven rate hikes for this year.
For 2023, the Fed sees the Federal funds rate at 2.8%, up from its prior projection of 1.6%. The Fed's terminal rate for Fed funds – the rate that coincides with its mandate of full employment and stable inflation – was downgraded to 2.4% from 2.5% previously. 
The start of Fed’s rate-hike cycle hike comes as the central bank looks to step up its fight against inflation to ensure elevated price pressures don’t become entrenched.
The core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, jumped to 5.2% in February, the biggest increase since April 1983.
Many have argued that the central bank has left it too late to tackle inflation, and now finds itself having to play catch up. But tightening too aggressively into an economy that is expected to slow, runs the risk of a recession or even worse, stagflation.
The latest projections from the Fed do little provide comfort against these concerns. Fed members downgraded expectations on economic growth, while the pace of red-hot inflation is forecast to continue.
The economy is expected to grow by 2.8% in 2022, down from a prior estimate of 4%, the estimate for the unemployment rate was unchanged from December at 3.5%, while the pace of inflation is forecast to accelerate to 4.1% from 2.7% previously.  
In his press conference that followed the monetary policy statement, Powell pushed back against recession fears. ""[W]e feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.""
The road to price stability for the Fed will be long and has been paved with more headwinds in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine war pushing prices even higher.
""The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship,"" the Fed said in a statement. ""The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the invasion and related events are likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity.""
“Powell clearly understands that the Fed is going to really have to focus on inflation now as it's gotten far beyond their expectations,” Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager at FolioBeyond said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday.
“But this isn’t something that you can reduce in a short period … it's going to take a while,” Smith added.
The conclusion of the March meeting also draws the curtain on the Fed’s monthly bond purchase programme, or quantitative easing programme, which played a major role in cushioning the economy from the pandemic impact.  
With the QE now in the rearview mirror, the Fed has been weighing options on how to reduce the size of its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet. Powell said ""excellent progress"" had been made on a plan to shrink the balance sheet, which could be implemented ""as soon as our next meeting in May.""
""The shrinkage of the balance sheet ... might be the equivalent of another rate increase,"" Powell added."

The company's action was disclosed by its senior vice president of government affairs, Nate Tibbits, in a tweet as a reply to a comment by Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.
Urging Tibbits to stop supplies to Russia, Fedorov said Qualcomm products are still available in Russia and it ""inadvertently enables this country to kill thousands of Ukrainians.""
In his reply, Tibbits said, ""This is incorrect. Qualcomm has called for a peaceful resolution to Russia's aggression in Ukraine, made direct donations to relief organizations & match employee contributions.""
""We comply with U.S. sanctions & laws are not selling products to Russian companies,"" he said. 
Thanking the move, Fedorov subsequently suggested that the chipmaker can send its satellite phones for Ukrainian rescuers if it wants to help.

While the invasion has drawn the ire of Western nations and resulted in several U.S. companies halting operations in Russia, the country has called its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Revenue from Russia and Ukraine accounts for less than 1% of its total revenue, Qualcomm had said at its stockholder meeting earlier this month.

MILAN (Reuters) - Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) said on Wednesday that its loans to Russian and Ukrainian clients amounted to 5.1 billion euros net of guarantees from credit export agencies, which is around 1% of the total for Italy's biggest bank.
Intesa added in a statement it was analysing its exposure to Russia and Ukraine to understand how to better handle risks in light of the European Union's decision to phase out Russian fossil fuels by 2027.
Of the overall loan figure, some 4 billion euros are cross-border, with oil and gas firms accounting for half of the total.
Taking into account off-balance sheet items, Intesa's total net exposure to the two countries is 5.7 billion euros ($6.3 billion), Reuters calculations based on Intesa's figures show.
Almost all of the loans expire by 2027, Intesa said, giving it time to work out a solution before the EU-set deadline.
""Over two-thirds of loans to Russian customers refer to top-notch industrial groups,"" it said, adding these had ""long-established commercial relationships with customers that are part of major international value chains, with a significant portion of their proceeds coming from commodities.""
Intesa's local subsidiaries in Russia and Ukraine account for just 1.1 billion euros in loans to customers and sums due from banks, it added.
Some 200 million euros are loans to entities that have been hit by international sanctions against Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, it said.
Like other major international banks, including domestic rival UniCredit, Intesa has said it is reviewing its presence in Russia, where it serves corporate clients with a staff of around 980 people across 28 branches.
UniCredit on Tuesday said it was considering pulling out of Russia.
Analysts at broker Autonomous calculated a core capital hit of around 75 basis points, lower than its initial estimate of 90 basis points, assuming a 60% loss on cross border exposures.
Intesa, which used to handle more than half of commercial transactions between Italy and Russia, has financed major investment Russian projects, such as the Blue Stream gas pipeline and the sale of a stake in oil group Rosneft. 
It also employs 780 staff in Ukraine, where its Pravex Bank unit has 45 branches.
Intesa has said it was continuing to provide essential banking services at Pravex branches whenever it was safe to do so, while helping to evacuate employees under threat.
The bank said its local subsidiaries' off-balance sheet exposure amounted to 300 million euros.

For the rest of the group exposures deriving, for example, from untapped credit lines were 1.1 billion euros and covered by 800 million euros in guarantees.

SCHULTZ ON MSNBC MORNING JOE IN JANUARY 2019:
""If you look at the history of unions, unions arrived in America because there were a lot of bad actors, bad actors of companies.""
""Unions arrived on the scene because companies were not doing the right thing for their employees. Unions have an obligation and responsibility to protect their employees but they're also very good companies in America, very good managements in America, who recognize that we have to share success, that not every business decision is an economic one."" 
""Unions have a role to play. But unions are not the answer. The answer to inequality is a comprehensive tax reform.”
SCHULTZ IN A LETTER TO U.S. STARBUCKS EMPLOYEES IN NOVEMBER 2021: 
""What the leadership team has done in Buffalo is what we have always done. We listen. We learn. We get better together. No partner has ever needed to have a representative seek to obtain things we all have as partners at Starbucks. And I am saddened and concerned to hear anyone thinks that is needed now.""
In November, Schultz shared advice he received from a rabbi to employees who had been ordered to a large meeting with managers in Buffalo, where the first of Starbucks' 9,000 U.S. company locations were deciding whether to join the union.

In the meeting, Schultz likened Starbucks' pro-employee stance to Holocaust prisoners in concentration camps sharing blankets, according to media reports. The remarks led to backlash on social media. 
""One person for every six was given a blanket .. .most people shared their blanket with five other people. And rabbi says to me, take your blanket and go share it with five other people. And so much of that story is threaded into what we have tried to do at Starbucks. Share our blanket.""

""Technology is one of our key areas of focus for Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn)'s origination & advisory business globally and especially in the U.S.,"" a spokesperson for the bank said.
The origination and advisory business at Deutsche Bank caters to major corporate clients and financial institutions, and advises on capital structures and sustainability ratings.
Deutsche Bank has been sharpening its focus on technology within the origination and advisory business with some key hires. Prior to Shah, Sean McCarthy and Jusung Kwok also joined the bank to expand its footprint in the tech investment banking space.

Shah, who was a senior managing director at financial services firm Macquarie Capital, will also head the U.S. West Coast software origination unit, the bank said in the memo, contents of which were confirmed by the spokesperson.
Shah is a veteran in the tech dealmaking sector with over 20 years of experience. During his stint at Macquarie, he was instrumental in building out the company's U.S. technology investment banking practice, according to the memo.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - CF Industries Holdings (NYSE:CF) is increasing fertilizer shipments to both U.S. coasts from the world's largest nitrogen complex in Louisiana to help offset a decline in exports from Russia after it invaded Ukraine, Chief Executive Tony Will said.
Global fertilizer supplies have tightened and prices have increased from already high levels as sanctions bite Russia and its ally Belarus. Nitrogen fertilizer is one of the most commonly used fertilizers to boost production of corn, canola and other crops. 
Illinois-based CF Industries leased several vessels to transport more fertilizer, mostly liquid nitrogen, from its complex in Donaldsonville, Louisiana, Will told Reuters. The company can ship products up the Mississippi River to the Midwest and load vessels to sail downriver through the Gulf of Mexico to tanks on either coast.
""Historically a fair bit of Russian imports have come particularly to the East Coast, and we're trying to make up for that lack of availability by moving our tons over there,"" Will said.
Russia has previously accounted for 15% of U.S. nitrogen imports, said the Fertilizer Institute, an industry group. Russia is also a major exporter of natural gas, a key input in producing nitrogen fertilizer.
To boost supplies, CF Industries delayed maintenance work at one of its six plants in Donaldsonville until the second half of the year to avoid taking the facility offline, Will said.
""The plant is running less efficiently than it would, but it's still better to have it online,"" he said.
CF Industries has five U.S. nitrogen manufacturing complexes, along with plants in Canada and the United Kingdom. The company's ability to increase production is limited because it tries to operate plants at their maximum rate all year, Will said.
""We're moving as much product as we can right now with the assets that we have available,"" he said.

 Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR) Ltd, another fertilizer producer, has said Russia's invasion of Ukraine could result in prolonged disruptions to global fertilizer supplies.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""

Companies hiring gig workers have started imposing these surcharges as drivers on social media protest about high gas prices due to Western sanctions on Russia, a major oil producer.
The fuel surcharge policy kicks in starting next week and will stay in place for at least 60 days, Lyft said, adding that the money will go directly to drivers.

The move mirrors that of rival Uber (NYSE:UBER), which said its customers would have to pay a surcharge of either 45 cents or 55 cents on each trip.
On Tuesday, food-delivery company DoorDash had said its U.S. delivery partners would be eligible for a 10% cashback on gas purchases beginning March 17.

820,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 02:21PM ET</span>",Citigroup to cover travel expenses for abortions as U.S. states curb access,"(Reuters) -Citigroup Inc has started covering travel expenses for employees who go out of state for abortions because of newly enacted restrictions in Texas and other places, becoming the first major U.S. bank to make that commitment.
The new policy is ""in response to changes in reproductive healthcare laws in certain states in the U.S.,"" the bank said late on Tuesday in a public filing ahead of its annual shareholders meeting in April.
The filing said the travel benefits are ""to facilitate access to adequate resources"" and did not specifically mention abortion. Citi will cover transportation and lodging for employees who need to leave states such as Texas for abortions, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Citi has taken stances on controversial issues before, including in 2018 when it enacted restrictions on its clients who sell firearms following several U.S. mass shootings.
""More and more companies are being forced to take stands on issues because of the demands of some stakeholders that antagonize other stakeholders,"" Witold Henisz, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and director of its Political Risk Lab. 
""Millennial workers and consumers demand that companies take stands and look to (their) CEOs especially where the government has failed to act or taken a stand of which they disapprove. This will continue to grow as a strategic challenge for companies,"" Henisz said.
Several states with Republican-led legislatures are passing new abortion limits in anticipation that the U.S. Supreme Court will likely undercut constitutional abortion protections this year.
In Texas, the public can sue anyone who helps women get abortions after six weeks. The number of abortions in Texas dropped by some 60% within the first month after the law took effect on Sept. 1, according to state health department data. 
Idaho's senate has passed a bill banning abortion after six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant.
The new  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) policy was reported earlier by Bloomberg News.

The filing describes employee pay and benefits, as well as environmental, social and governance policies.
While Citigroup does not have consumer bank branches in Texas, it has institutional businesses there and has long employed thousands of Texans in large offices handling data.

The investment would make the facility the biggest plant in the region for the 2023 CR-V Hybrid crossover and includes equal grants of C$131.6 million from the governments of Canada and Ontario, Honda of Canada Mfg said on Wednesday.
Honda's announcement comes at a time when automakers globally have sharpened their focus on producing environmentally friendly vehicles in response to rising demand.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government sees the auto sector as a key part of its efforts to lower national carbon footprint.
Rich in key materials for electric vehicle battery production - including lithium, graphite, cobalt and nickel - Canada is trying to woo battery makers to safeguard the future of its manufacturing heartland in Ontario.
""We're positioning Canada as a leader in low and zero emission vehicle manufacturing,"" Trudeau said at Honda's manufacturing plant in Ontario.
The province is close to U.S. automakers in Michigan and Ohio, and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis NV have all announced plans to make electric vehicles there.
As Canada's economy recovers from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it must ensure that the ""recovery is sustainable, and it creates good jobs,"" Trudeau said.
Honda said Ontario plant upgrades would secure thousands of jobs in Canada. 
The investment would also bring the Japanese automaker closer to meeting its goal of making electric and fuel cell vehicles account for 100% of all sales by 2040.

Having started production in 1986, Honda of Canada Mfg has the capacity to make more than 400,000 vehicles and 190,000 engines annually.

Shares of the U.S. retailer, which is facing pressure from activist investors to sell itself, rose as much as 17% to $62.98, valuing the company at about $8.76 billion.
The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that private equity firm Sycamore Partners and Hudson's Bay were planning bids in the high $60s per share. 
Kohl's has asked suitors to submit offers by Wednesday, the report said. It added that the company has indicated it believed it was worth over $70 per share, citing one of the people.
Sycamore Partners declined to comment.
Kohl's had previously rejected two buyout offers, valuing it at between $64 and $65 per share, from Sycamore and Starboard Value-backed Acacia Research. But Kohl's said this month that investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) spent January, February and March talking to more than 20 parties, adding it had provided a few of them access to more financial data.
Axios was the first to report that Hudson's Bay was considering a bid for Kohl's.

""The board will measure potential bids against a compelling standalone plan,"" Kohl's said in an emailed response on Wednesday, adding the engagement with potential bidders was ""robust and ongoing"".

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's audit court wants more clarification from the government before approving the sale of Atlantia's unit Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI), sources told Reuters, in a move that complicates a deal worth more than 8 billion euros ($8.80 billion).
Atlantia signed an agreement in June to sell its controlling stake in Autostrade to a consortium comprising state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and investment funds Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Macquarie.
A so-called precautionary legitimacy check from the audit court is needed before finalising the deal.
Its magistrates are seeking more details from the government and have asked top officials to appear before them on Thursday, two sources close to the matter told Reuters asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
This means responses to queries from the court were not considered sufficient, one of the sources said, without providing details on what its objections were.
The transport ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Last week the government replied to some of the issues raised by the court. The second source said Rome was stepping up efforts to secure the court's green light.
Under the Italian law, the court normally adjudicates on whether state agencies have followed correct procedures, without entering into the merits of projects.
In most instances the court rubber stamps the government's plans, but its objections can sometimes be hard to overcome. Last year, for example, it scuppered the launch of an Italian COVID vaccine.
Atlantia, controlled by the Benetton family, said it expected the audit court to clear the sale of Autostrade in the next few weeks and then it would take up to 30 days to close the deal.
The sale of Aspi is the latest development of a dispute between Atlantia and the Italian authorities that started in 2018 after the collapse of a motorway bridge in which 43 people died.

Autostrade per l'Italia has proposed to pay 1 million euros as a settlement and 26 million euros in compensation to the Italian state for a case, while sister company SPEA has offered 810,000 euros.

Multiple Chinese provinces and cities have tightened restrictions in line with Beijing's zero-tolerance goal of suppressing COVID-19 as quickly as possible, including the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen.

Still, its goals for higher electric vehicle (EV) production remain unchanged, Chief Technical Officer Frank Weber said. The company intends to more than double EV sales to more than 200,000 this year and reach 2 million fully-electric sales by 2025.
It will set up five new partnerships for battery factories in locations close to where EVs are produced in Europe, China, and the NAFTA region, purchasing chief Joachim Post said, without providing details.
The premium carmaker reported a 10.3% EBIT margin for 2021, its highest since 2017, but averaged lower earnings per vehicle than competitors like Audi and Mercedes-Benz.
It now expects an earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin of 7-9% for its car business rather than 8-10%, due to the Ukraine crisis.
BMW suspended production at some German plants after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but will return to full production next week, production chief Milan Nedeljkovic said. Production of the Mini in Oxford remains suspended.
Schedules were shifted to compensate for lost production time, Nedeljkovic said, with renovation works at certain plants planned for later in the year completed while production was suspended.
The Ukraine crisis and COVID-19 related disruptions in China have forced carmakers from Toyota to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to shutter plants and raise prices. Many warn of further changes if circumstances do not stabilise.
BMW said that while it was still able to source some parts from western Ukraine and was engaging suppliers in other locations worldwide to keep up production, further interruptions were to be expected.

Rising raw material prices would likely cost the company a sum in the hundreds of millions of euros this year, finance chief Nicolas Peter said. 
Still, it expected to maintain its Ukrainian suppliers in the middle- to long-term, Post said.

(Reuters) -European stocks closed at over two-week highs on Wednesday after fresh talks of compromise from Russia and Ukraine boosted gains spurred by China's promise to roll out more economic stimulus.
Moscow and Kyiv discussed a status for Ukraine outside of NATO, lifting hopes for a breakthrough after three weeks of war.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed up 3.1%, at its highest level since Feb. 28. 
Markets also climbed after China's Vice Premier Liu He said Beijing would roll out more measures to boost the Chinese economy as well as favourable policy steps for its capital markets.
""Today has delivered a double-whammy of gifts for embattled markets,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
""China stimulus headlines and Ukraine deal reports will always give stocks a lift, and to get them both on the same day has meant risk appetite has surged in impressive style.""
Dutch tech investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF), which has a huge stake in China's Tencent, surged nearly 23.9% after hitting all-time lows in the previous session. The stock led the wider technology index up nearly 6.6%.
Other China-exposed sectors such as miners and autos rose 3.6% and 5.2%, respectively. Luxury stocks LVMH, Richemont and Hermes, also reliant on China for a large part of their revenue, gained between 4.8% and 7.8%.
The Ukraine crisis has also sent commodity prices soaring, with crude prices breaching $139 a barrel at one point and raising fears of high inflation.
While crude prices are trading at $102, investors worry about aggressive tightening by major central banks to tame inflation. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points when it releases its policy decision at 1800 GMT on Wednesday.
Investors will be looking closely at the updated quarterly economic and interest rate projections, the first concrete guidance about how inflation and the Ukraine crisis has influenced policymakers. 

Among other stocks, Sweden-based private equity fund EQT (NYSE:EQT) jumped 11.9% after it said it had agreed to buy investment firm Baring Private Equity Asia (BPEA) in a deal worth 6.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion). 
German carmaker BMW gained 4.1% despite lowering its profit margin expectations for its automotive segment for 2022 due to the war in Ukraine.

ARTEIXO, Spain (Reuters) -Sales at Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) surged above pre-pandemic levels at the start of its financial year, though the world's No.1 fast fashion retailer by sales faces a fresh challenge in the months ahead after it stopped trading in Russia. 
Inditex shares tumbled on March 5 after the company closed its 502 shops in Russia and halted online sales there after the country's invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of Western sanctions. Russia and Ukraine accounted for 5% of its sales growth from Feb. 1 to March 13.
""Our objective is to resume operations in Russia and Ukraine as soon as circumstances allow,"" CEO Oscar Garcia Maceiras said during a news conference after Inditex published results for its financial year to the end of January.
He said that the company is still paying salaries to employees in Russia.
The Spanish group, brands of which also include Massimo Dutti and Pull&Bear, on Wednesday reported that its store and online sales between Feb. 1 and March 13 jumped by 33% from the same period a year earlier and were up 21% from the same period of pre-pandemic 2019. 
Net profit in the year to Jan. 31 more than doubled to 3.2 billion euros ($3.51 billion) as it bounced back from the worst effects of the pandemic the previous year, mirroring the recovery at rivals such as Sweden's H&M. 
Fourth-quarter sales, however, were hit hard by temporary store closures in countries such as Germany and China as the Omicron coronavirus variant spread. Those restrictions knocked an estimated 400 million euros off quarterly sales.
""Inditex results are softer than consensus expectations, mainly due to Omicron effects in the second half of Q4,"" RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain wrote in a note to clients, adding that the company had still made ""a very strong start"" to its new financial year. 
Shares in Inditex, which has 6,477 stores worldwide, were down 0.4% by 1230 GMT.
The group weathered the pandemic in part through its ability to produce more than half of its goods near Spain and deliver them to consumers quickly while also raising the share of online sales to about a quarter of its overall revenue in 2021.
Marta Ortega, the daughter of Inditex founder Amancio Ortega, next month takes over as chairwoman of the group in the last step of a generational handover that began a decade ago.
She will replace veteran executive chairman Pablo Isla in April, joining new CEO Garcia Maceiras in a management team that must contend with inflationary pressures and the uncertainties caused by the invasion of Ukraine. 
Garcia Maceiras said the company plans to make price adjustments in markets affected by inflation without disrupting its business model of accessible fashion. In Spain it expects to increase prices by an average of 2%.
""The rises will depend on the situation and will be selective. We do not plan massive increases,"" he added.
Inditex said the United States became its largest market behind Spain last year and that all markets, with the exception of Russia and Ukraine, have recovered to pre-pandemic levels.

""Apparel demand has already been weak in Europe so far this year and any further softness in the demand environment will make it even harder to pass through higher input costs in a deflationary industry,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a recent note to clients.

The Jet Aviation unit, which deals with maintenance, repair and overhaul of airplanes, is likely to be hit primarily in Geneva and somewhat in Basel, Austria, the company said.
""It would be folly to think that the jet (business), in particular, given where they're located won't see some impact,"" said Phebe Novakovic, chief executive officer of General Dynamics.

Novakovic said the company is accessing the impact and doesn't have an estimate at the moment.

The U.S.-based company has also decided to set aside imported shipments in provinces such as Fujian and Jiangsu for sanitizing for a specific number of days. The transit time for shipments may be extended, it warned. 
Multiple Chinese provinces and cities have in recent days tightened restrictions in line with Beijing's zero-tolerance goal of suppressing COVID-19 as quickly as possible.

The private-equity firm and Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s plan a bid in the high $60s for each share though Kohl’s is looking at over $70 as a fair value, according to the Journal. The report said the company has asked the suitors to submit offers by end of day. The shares touched a high of $63 in today’s session so far.
According to WSJ, Starboard Value had offered $64 per share or $9 billion in January, which Kohl’s found too low.
The retailer has been under pressure from activist investors to consider a sale and unlock value of its real estate. One such investor, hedge fund Engine Capital which owns around 1% of the company, has been urging the department store chain to consider separation of its faster growing e-commerce business.
Oak Street Real Estate Capital has been named as a possible bidder for Kohl’s real estate.

BERLIN/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Europeans are stocking up on survival gear like sleeping bags and camping cookers, as well as canned and dried food, in part to donate to refugees arriving from Ukraine and also due to fears of supplies being disrupted and conflict spreading.
Sales of products such as plastic cans, camping gear, batteries, flashlights and cell phone solar chargers jumped as much as sixfold in the past two weeks at Swedish hardware store chain Clas Ohlsson, a spokesperson said.
""It's clear that people want to be prepared for crises. The biggest increase is for products recommended to have at home during a crisis, for example radios,"" he said.
Sales of milk powder, pasta, grains, and canned foods rose by up to 20% in the past four weeks, according to Swedish grocery retailer Ica Gruppen.
Consumers are stocking up for themselves while humanitarian organizations are also buying products to send to Ukraine, according to Ica Sweden purchasing director Andreas Sbrodigliga.
In the Netherlands, Jimmy Bakker at outdoor supplier Dumpstore Amsterdam, has seen brisk trade since the war started. 
""When the war broke out people were buying emergency blankets, emergency food rations, radios and stoves. Last week, people rented vehicles and they were going to drive to Ukraine to hand out there,"" he said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments that Moscow's nuclear deterrent is on high alert had already prompted people in Central Europe to rush to buy iodine which they believe may protect them from radiation.
In Poland, which has taken in more than half of the 3 million refugees fleeing Ukraine, convenience store chain Zabka reported higher sales of canned goods, rice, groats and bottled water in some regions due to collections for refugees.
Hygiene products like wet wipes, gels, soaps, toothpastes and porridges are also flying off the shelves in Poland, according to drugstore chain Rossmann.
In Germany, where 175,000 refugees from Ukraine have been registered so far, sales of camping products like sleeping bags and mats have jumped in the past two weeks at sports chain Decathlon, a spokesperson said.
The company said it has also donated camping products to humanitarian organisations helping in Ukraine.
TEMPORARY CAP ON OIL AND FLOUR SALES
German wholesaler Metro has temporarily set a cap on the amount shoppers can buy of certain products, such as cooking oils and flour, but said it sees no reason for consumers to stockpile, adding fresh supplies are on the way.
""We are currently observing high demand from our commercial customers for various long-life foods, which can be attributed to the purchase of relief supplies, among other things,"" a spokesperson said.
Ukraine is a major global producer and exporter of grain and vegetable oils, but officials and farmers expect a decline in the 2022 harvest and exports due to the war. 
Germany's BGA trade association warned last week that the Ukraine war could cause bottlenecks in the food trade as well as threaten supplies of toilet paper and kitchen roll, and chemical cleaning agents.
    Transport problems were exacerbated by higher fuel costs and a shortage of Ukrainian truck drivers, it said.
However, most retailers have bolstered their supply chains since COVID-19 lockdowns triggered panic buying in 2020.
""We live in difficult times, but at the moment there is no room for panic,"" Dimitar Margaritov, Chairman of Bulgaria's Consumer Protection Commission, told national radio.

Dutch retailer Ahold Delhaize said it saw higher sales at its stores in the Czech Republic due to people buying donations for refugees, but no cause for concern.
""Our supply chain in Europe is quite robust at this point and we have enough products for our customers in stock and at our suppliers,” the company said.

BERLIN (Reuters) -  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and BMW were among the latest companies on Wednesday to warn of disruption to their businesses from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, while ad group Publicis said it had handed over control of its Russian subsidiary to protect its staff.
The list of Western companies that have suspended operations or pulled out of Russia is growing by the day after the West imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's access to funding.
Germany's BMW joined other carmakers in detailing the impact of the unfolding crisis in Ukraine on its operations as it downgraded its profit margin forecast. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 related disruptions in China have forced carmakers from Toyota to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to shutter plants and raise prices, with many warning of further pain if circumstances do not stabilise.
BMW said that while it was still able to source some parts from western Ukraine and was engaging alternative suppliers to keep up production, further interruptions were to be expected in coming weeks.
France's Michelin, which was the first international tyre maker to start manufacturing in Russia in 2004, suspended production at its plant in Davydovo which employs about 750 people.
""There is a lot of supply difficulties - which means we have disruption of financial flows, and there's a problem of currency instability,"" it said.
Michelin said its priority was supporting affected employees.
Zara owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX), which has stopped trading in Russia, said on Wednesday its objective was to ""resume operations in Russia and Ukraine as soon as circumstances allow"", adding that it was still paying salaries to employees in the country.
PROTECTING STAFF 
Multinationals from consumer goods companies to professional services suppliers have said they have to consider their staff in Russia and ramifications from any move to cut ties with the country.
Russia has taken the first steps towards allowing the nationalisation of foreign-owned factories that shut operations, a move that further complicates the transfer of ownership of assets for Western companies.
 British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) told Reuters on Friday that exiting its business or stopping manufacturing could be regarded as criminal bankruptcy by Russia and lead to action against local management.
""There's no way, consciously, we can expose our people to criminal sanctions,"" the Camel and Lucky Strike maker said.
BAT (LON:BATS) and rival Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) are looking to transfer their businesses in Russia to local third parties.
French ad group Publicis, which had been quiet about the impact of the conflict, said it was handing control of its operations to Sergey Koptev, founding chairman of Publicis in Russia, effective immediately.
Publicis is among the first Western companies to transfer legal ownership of a Russian subsidiary. 
It said it was ceding ownership with the clear contractual condition of ensuring a future for its employees in the country.

""We were determined to take the necessary time to come up with a solution that was truly people-first, because our 1,200 employees in Russia are our people too. We couldn't just abandon them,"" Chief Executive Officer Arthur Sadoun said.
Bigger rival WPP (LON:WPP) said earlier this month it would discontinue its operations in Russia. It said it would support its staff and work closely with clients and partners as it withdrew from the country.

(Reuters) -The World Trade Organization (WTO) praised a provisional deal to waive patent rights for COVID-19 vaccines after more than a year of deadlock, though drugmakers said the move risked undermining the industry's ability to respond to future health crises.
The United States, the European Union, India and South Africa agreed on Tuesday on key elements for a waiver.
It now needs the backing of the 164 members of the WTO, which takes decisions based on consensus, so rejection by just one country could still block an accord.
""This is a major step forward,"" WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said after Wednesday's agreement was announced. ""But we are not there yet. We have more work to do to ensure that we have the support of the entire WTO membership.""
If approved, the agreement would mean countries could permit domestic manufacturers to produce vaccines without patent-holder consent for three or five years. But only developing countries accounting for less than 10% of global exports of COVID-19 shots in 2021 could do this.
That would appear to exclude China but clear India, which banned vaccine exports for much of 2021.
Global drugmakers in the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) said the move could undermine their ability to respond to future crises.
""Biopharmaceutical companies reaffirm their position that weakening patents now when it is widely acknowledged that there are no longer supply constraints of COVID-19 vaccines, sends the wrong signal,"" IFPMA director general Thomas Cueni said.
The People's Vaccine Alliance, a coalition of over 90 campaign groups, said the proposal ignored other intellectual property barriers such as trade secrets and failed to include treatments that could save millions of lives.
""In a crisis, half measures are not acceptable,"" it said.
The provisional agreement says WTO members should decide within six months on an extension to cover diagnostics and therapeutics.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) declined to comment on the initiative and its German vaccine partner BioNTech had no immediate comment. The two have pledged to provide 2 billion doses of their COVID vaccine to low and middle income countries in 2021 and 2022.
AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), the maker of another major COVID vaccine, also declined to comment.

COVAX, global programme to provide vaccines to poorer nations, has been struggling this year to place more than 300 million doses, as supply and donations have ramped up.
Poorer nations have face challenges ranging from limits on cold-chain shortage to vaccine hesitancy and inadequate funds to support distribution.

Investing.com – Shares of vaccine makers traded higher Wednesday after Pfizer-BioNTech (NYSE:PFE) (NASDAQ:BNTX) sought U.S. FDA’s emergency use authorization for a second booster shot of their COVID-19 vaccine for people aged 65 and older.
The news of the companies approaching the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was first reported by The Washington Post Tuesday.
Shares of  Pfizer  and its partner BioNTech were up 1.7% and 7%, respectively. The development guided rival Moderna's (NASDAQ:MRNA) shares also higher. They rose 11%.
The submission to the Food and Drug Administration includes data collected in Israel, where a second booster is authorized for many people over age 18.
The vaccine makers have for long argued for more boosters, saying additional doses will be needed for new virus variants that emerge. That reasoning didn’t find much acceptance, given vaccine hesitancy amid questions about how many shots would be enough.
Top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci and other U.S. health officials have also extended the case for a fourth shot many times, suggesting one might be needed for the elderly and to prepare for the possibility of another surge.
With fresh infections in China surpassing 2021 levels, the defense for another booster has been bolstered.
Pfizer last month said 2022 sales of its COVID-19 vaccine may not top its current forecast of $32 billion, a 13% decline from 2021 levels, according to Reuters."

847,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 11:22AM ET</span>",Analysis-SPACs splash the cash to salvage deals as market unravels,"By Echo Wang and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -SPACs are turning to costly new tactics to keep investors from jumping ship as market confidence wanes in the once red-hot alternative to IPOs.
Blank-check acquisition firms and the companies they acquire are having to hand over bigger stakes in the ventures to investors in some cases, often at big discounts. Deal managers are also seeking backstop financing from investment firms and plowing in more of their own cash.
Less than three months into 2022, 13 mergers involving special purpose acquisition companies have already fallen through in the United States, according to data from industry tracker SPAC Research. That compares with a total of 18 in the whole of 2021.
In money terms, almost $9.5 billion worth of mergers have been canned this year, according to Dealogic data.
The main cause of deals being abandoned, market players say, is the risk of redemptions - where investors exercise their right to sell shares in the venture back to the SPAC before the merger is completed, and for the price they paid for them. 
""Every transaction is worried about redemptions and every transaction is trying to figure out how to mitigate it,"" said Amir Emami, global co-head of SPAC coverage at RBC Capital Markets.
The approaches being employed by SPACs include offering bonus stock to investors who choose not to redeem shares.
SPACs are shell companies that raise money in an initial public offering and put it in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public. Since investors are unaware of the target company ahead of the IPO, SPACs often grant them the right to redeem their initial investment as an incentive to put their money in the trust.
Yet significant redemptions undermine the viability of such deals. At the same time, shares of many companies that went public during the boom last year have fared poor, leaving some investors nursing losses and making new SPACs look more risky.
Indeed, the deals are drying up.
Only 24 SPAC mergers worth $28.3 billion have been announced so far this year, versus the 93 deals worth $233 billion in the first quarter of 2021, according to SPAC Research. Only 48 new SPACs were floated on U.S. exchanges up to the end of February, compared with 214 during the same period last year, according to data from Dealogic. 
""What was an attractive deal, say six months ago, may not be as attractive today given the market has sold off meaningfully since then,"" Emami said. 
'THE ICING ON THE CAKE'
Measures such as offering extra stock have been successful in getting some mergers over the line, yet can come at a heavy financial cost for the SPAC managers, their target companies and their original investors, who become diluted.
""With a high number of SPACs still seeking targets and the skepticism due to the pullback in the market, it has become harder to persuade target companies to want to engage with SPACs and have the related management distraction,"" said Atif Azher, partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.
Bonus stocks, or ""bonus pools"", for investors who eschew redemptions, are typically comprised of founder shares or regular company shares that were reserved for the SPAC managers. 
In January, in the $9.3 billion merger of Cohn Robbins Holdings Corp with lottery operator Allwyn, 6.6 million shares, worth an estimated $65 million, were offered to shareholders who elected not to redeem their shares.
""The best way to maximize participation by SPAC shareholders is to bring to market a highly profitable company with exciting growth prospects at an attractive valuation. The bonus share reward is just the icing on the cake,"" Cohn Robbins co-chairmen Gary D. Cohn and Clifton S. Robbins told Reuters.
DPCM Capital Inc, another SPAC, gave shareholders about 5 million shares for not redeeming their existing holding in its $1.2 billion merger with quantum computing company D-wave Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) Inc.
SPACs are also raising additional financings, known as private placements in public equity (PIPEs), to get deals over the line. About a dozen SPACs have raised additional PIPEs in recent months to mitigate the risk of redemptions. 
Some of the fundraising is also done via over-the-counter equity derivative agreements. If investors who buy the shares choose not to redeem them before merger completion, the SPAC agrees to buy back those shares from them at a later date after the merger is safely in the bag. 
MANAGERS PAY MILLIONS
Some investment firms have also stepped in recent months to backstop deals. One of them, Atalaya Capital Management LP, offered Yellowstone Acquisition Company up to $70 million for its $777 million merger with airport hanger manager Sky Harbour in January, five months after the SPAC deal was announced. 
In other cases, it is the SPAC investors who step up. 
Shareholders of SPAC Dynamics Special Purpose Corp, for example, including funds managed by Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and T. Rowe Price, committed $86 million in non-redemption agreements in December to help it complete its merger with biotech firm Senti Bio, in a deal valued at $601 million. 
Some SPAC managers have also chosen to invest more of their own money into deals to make up for redemptions. For example, the parent company of Trebia Acquisition Corp, a SPAC that agreed to merge with marketing platform System1 Inc, agreed to provide a $250 million backstop in January 2022 for the $1.4 billion deal to close.

""Most of the terminations more recently are more market driven,"" said Michael Levitt, partner at law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. 
""They (SPACs) are concerned that the redemptions are going to be too high, and the target company is not going to have enough money to meet its minimum cash condition,"" he added, referring to the specified amount a SPAC must hold upon the deal closing.

848,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 11:22AM ET</span>","Meet the company where staff work less, but produce more","By Lucien Libert
LYON, France (Reuters) - When French company boss Laurent de la Clergerie decided to let his staff work a four-day week, on the same pay as before, he knew he risked hurting his bottom line. ""Some people took me for a crazy person,"" he recalled.
But a year on, he says the opposite has happened: his LDLC company selling consumer technology has increased its annual turnover by 40% without hiring any extra staff.
The secret, he said, is that the approximately 1,000 people his firm employs feel trusted and appreciated, and so they are more productive.
""At the end of the day, it's brought only good things for the team,"" said 51-year-old de la Clergerie.
As the world emerges from a pandemic that prompted many people to re-evaluate their work-life balance, companies and workers around the world are asking if, like de la Clergerie's firm, they could work less.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gave its 2,300 Japan-based employees Fridays off in 2019, and said it saw productivity rise 40%. Consumer group Unilever (NYSE:UL) launched a four-day week trial for local staff in New Zealand. Spanish telecoms company Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) has trialled a four-day week for 10% of its domestic workforce.
Johann Peters, who works in one of LDLC's stores near its headquarters in a suburb of Lyon, south-east France, uses the extra day off to head to the supermarket to pick up his weekly shopping. He then takes his daughter, 9-year-old Melissa, to her tennis practice.
""You come into work after your day off much more rested, and more efficient operationally,"" he said.
De la Clergerie said before he embarked on the change, he worked out that even in the worst case scenario, it would add to labour costs by at most 1.5 million euros per year. He said he felt that was a manageable risk.
Since then, he said that absenteeism and sick leaves were down, and that the company had not had to hire new people to offset the reduction in hours worked. 
Though the four-day week was not the only factor involved, de la Clergerie said it had contributed to a jump in turnover from around 500 million euros before the change, to close to 700 million euros ($769.86 million) since then.
Celine Henniaux, a 36-year-old who works in one of the firm's distribution centres, said she had no desire to go back to the way things were before.
""No no,"" she said. ""We've got a taste for having a day off during the week.""

849,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 11:06AM ET</span>",Most of UK's largest companies have at least one ethnic minority board member,"By Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - The majority of Britain's top companies now have at least one ethnic minority board member, the government-backed Parker Review committee, set up to improve the diversity of UK boards, said on Wednesday. 
Improving boardroom diversity has become a hot topic for policymakers and investors in recent years, as many believe it both helps to address social inequalities and also leads to better decision-making and performance over time.
""Our December 2021 target of every FTSE 100 company having at least one board director from a minority ethnic background has very nearly been met,"" said John Parker, chairman of the Parker Review Committee. 
""We have also secured commitments from many of the outstanding companies which mean it is likely that circa 97% of current FTSE 100 companies will comply with the target by the middle of the year.""
Last year, the number of FTSE 100 companies to meet the voluntary target rose to 89 from 74, and by March 2022, a further five had done so. Three have committed to do so and are in the advanced stages of recruiting.
Of the three companies yet to commit, one is in the process of being acquired and will delist, another is a Russian steel and mining company about to exit the FTSE 100, and the last is a UK subsidiary of a U.S. group, it said.

Most of the positions taken by ethnic minorities are non-executive, with only six in the position of chief executive of a FTSE 100 company, and 16 at a FTSE 250 company. 
Among the FTSE 250, 128 companies now meet the target ahead of an end-2024 deadline, it added. The targets for both the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 were originally set in 2017.

Lockheed, whose shares were down 6.4% in early trading, said in a statement that it was ""premature"" to speculate about the proposed budget. 
""The Department (of Defense) cannot confirm specific budget details until after the FY23 President's Budget is released,"" a Pentagon spokesperson said. 
Reuters reported last month that U.S. President Joe Biden was expected to ask Congress for a defense budget exceeding $770 billion for the next fiscal year, compared with $778 billion in 2022.
The budget is expected to benefit the biggest U.S. defense contractors, including Lockheed,  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) and General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD).
""This is a significant issue for the program,"" Cowen analyst Roman Schweizer said, referring to the news on request for fewer F-35s. 
Several factors from high operating and maintenance costs to difficult contract negotiations might have contributed to the development, Schweizer said.

The F-35 is one of the world's most advanced fighter aircraft and considered a highly sensitive export, sold only to the closest allies of the United States.
Lockheed Martin delivered a total of 142 F-35 fighter jets to the United States and its allies last year, three more than originally planned.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 10:51AM ET</span>",Analysis-Russian airlines face safety countdown to secure parts,"By Jamie Freed, Allison Lampert and Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - Russian airlines have weeks to orchestrate alternative supplies of banned aircraft parts or start grounding jets to avoid safety concerns as Western sanctions following Russian's invasion of Ukraine threaten their post-Soviet revival.
Moscow took a first step this week towards keeping its commercial fleet flying by allowing its airlines to re-register leased planes in Russia, giving local authorities direct control over the certificates of airworthiness needed for each jet.
That reverses a two-decades-old agreement allowing leasing companies to keep hundreds of jets registered in Bermuda because of worries over Russia's legal system - a transfer of authority that has long been a source of irritation to Russian officials.
Sheltered by those changes, Western analysts say airlines may start stripping some of Russia's 500 foreign-leased jets within weeks or even days for parts while shopping around for genuine, but resold, parts from countries such as China.
The licence changes and jet-stripping herald a legal battle with lessors, but Russia's tightly regulated carriers are seen unlikely for now to resort to buying counterfeit parts as Iran was forced to do during decades of U.S. sanctions.
""Russian airport and airline managements are professional, as are the regulators. Everything will in all likelihood be clearly documented if they are allowed to get on with the job,"" said Paul Hayes, director of air safety at Ascend by Cirium.
Flag carrier Aeroflot declined comment. Russia's transport ministry, aviation regulator and other airlines contacted by Reuters did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said on Wednesday Russia would accelerate the renewal of its domestic aerospace industry notably by accelerating its MS-21 and SSJ-100 jet projects.
The most recent audit from the UN's aviation body in 2015 found Russia was about in line with the world average for airworthiness and well above the average for accident investigations that play a major role in keeping flying safe, according to an official graphic summarising the results.
Other categories including licensing displayed gaps.
Volodymyr Bilotkach, an associate professor at the Singapore Institute of Technology, said flag carrier Aeroflot and S7 Airlines had safety records comparable with top-tier rivals, although some smaller carriers fared less well.
Whether the world's 11th largest aviation market, which was partly reliant on foreign maintenance providers such as Lufthansa Technik, can keep its skies safe behind a new Iron Curtain is likely to be tested rapidly.
""They will start having problems because of the spare parts and maintenance. So I'm afraid that the Russian safety record is going to worsen,"" Bilotkach said.
MISSING UPDATES
Among the items most likely to be quickly affected are software updates for flight management systems and changes to terrain databases used to give early warnings of a potential ground collision, frequently renewed to include new obstacles.
U.S. supplier Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON) has already refused to provide Russian carriers with a database upgrade for such systems, a person with knowledge of the discussions said.
Honeywell had no immediate comment.
Other weak points may be as mundane as aircraft tyres.
""They will need everything,"" a Western supplier said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Very rapidly they will have shortages starting with contact parts like tyres and brakes, which wear out most quickly, or have to repair routine knocks from ground carts.""
Each plane type has a minimum equipment list that can run to 1,500 pages. Some must be replaced at once if faulty, others can be used for a number of days or weeks until a maintenance visit.
A small minority of the world's most cash-starved airlines are adept at bending the rules, for example by swapping a pair of identical parts to start the clock running again on the one that is faulty, two aviation safety sources said.
Bijan Vasigh, an economics professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida, said Russian airlines can only cannibalise so many parts from other planes. 
""They (the West) really meant to paralyse aviation in Russia and I think they will be successful,"" he said. ""Very soon they will reach the limit of the parts and gradually I think we should see a reduction in flights inside Russia.""
U.S. sanctions allow for potential exemptions where safety is involved, following lobbying by the country's aerospace industry. There are no reports yet that contractors have applied for one. European Union rules allow very limited exemptions.
Russian airline executives say the sanctions will lead to safety problems ""sooner or later,"" but Western industry officials say it is up to airlines not to fly planes at risk.

""Sooner or later, the lack of original spare parts will make itself felt and pilots will have to ignore signals about non-functioning systems,"" one Russian airline executive said.
""At some point, the pilots will simply refuse to fly because it is not safe to ignore it,"" the executive told Reuters.

852,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 10:45AM ET</span>",SPAC-Backed Stocks Find Few Takers Even After Enduring 60% Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors grabbing shares in beaten-down companies after a merger with blank-check firms aren’t getting much of a bargain. In most cases, they’re still paying dearly for promises of revenue and profits that remain years away.
The median price-to-sales ratio for companies that merged with special-purpose acquisition companies since the start of 2020 sits at roughly 4.1, even after the sector has shed more than half of its value in the past year. And this counts only the ones with revenue to measure. Over half of the 286 target companies didn’t have any, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
That’s far higher than the benchmark S&P 500 Index, home of the world’s blue-chip corporations, which trades at about 2.8 times sales. While investors routinely pay more for startups because they’re counting on exponential growth, the prospects for some of these nascent companies targeted by SPACs are so shaky that they’ve warned they might be forced out of business.
The rich valuations remind Jay Ritter at the University of Florida of initial public offerings in the 1980s and 1990s, which were typically done by young companies with similarly optimistic business models. “A lot of them turned out to be disappointments for investors, and so far that’s been true with a set of companies that have recently merged with SPACs,” said Ritter, a finance professor who specializes in public-listings data.
Pricey multiples could support speculation that SPACs will overpay in order to guarantee their own self-preservation. Blank-check firms raise cash through public offerings so they can find and buy an operating business, but their structure typically requires a deal to be closed within two years, or else sponsors have to return the money. With that deadline looming, there’s a backlog of more than 600 SPACs still searching for deals.
The SPACs and the companies with which they merge have fallen sharply out of favor. The De-SPAC Index, which tracks 25 such companies, is down more than 60% in the past 12 months.
“Betting on newer, ‘hype’ companies with little realized value pose higher risks than any other type of investing,” said Anderson Lafontant, Miracle Mile Advisors senior advisor. “With the mania of SPACs fizzling, their actual performance is coming into light.”
EV Rout
Many of the high-profile de-SPACs are in the electric vehicle space, like Lucid Group Inc (NASDAQ:LCID) or ChargePoint Holdings Inc (NYSE:CHPT), while others have used celebrity ties to garner investor interest. Lucid, which carries a $38.6 billion value, booked just $26.4 million in fourth-quarter revenue and sliced its 2022 production targets last month, blaming supply chain disruptions.
To be fair, a bevy of companies already generating millions in sales have gone public via SPAC deals, but nevertheless are coming under pressure because of their blank-check origins. “The issue is how the market is valuing them,” Ritter said.
Metaverse-tied data platform company Matterport Inc (NASDAQ:MTTR) and Southeast Asia’s ride-hailing and delivery giant  Grab Holdings  Ltd (NASDAQ:GRAB) are among those Ritter has kept an eye on. Matterport has tumbled nearly 80% from a Nov. 29 record close while Grab has shed $21 billion in value from a December debut.
Companies that might not have been ready for prime time litter the worst performers among former SPAC targets. Clarus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:CLAR) has sunk so low it’s in danger of losing its listing and said in a December filing it doesn’t have enough cash to last another 12 months without more capital. 
Other de-SPACs with steep declines in market value include Skillz Inc (NYSE:SKLZ) and Sema4 Holdings Corp (NASDAQ:SMFR), former darlings of Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest.
On the flip side, Highpeak Energy (NASDAQ:HPK) has more than doubled in the past year amid a rally for commodities while Holley Inc (NYSE:HLLY), a car part manufacturer, is up more than 40% since its debut in July as sales soared nearly 40% in 2021.
Finance chiefs from Matterport and Skillz said their companies were being swept up with other technology stocks that have been under pressure amid expectations that interest rates will rise along with inflation, which tends to depress the current value of future earnings. Skillz Chief Financial Officer Ian Lee said in an interview that the range of companies that went public via SPAC merger have been “put under a negative halo.”
Representatives for the other companies mentioned didn’t immediately respond or provide a comment.

853,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 10:37AM ET</span>",Exclusive-Tesla halts work at Shanghai factory for two days amid China COVID curbs - notice,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is suspending production at its Shanghai factory for two days, according to a notice sent internally and to suppliers, as China tightens COVID restrictions to curb the country's latest outbreak. 
The Shanghai factory runs around the clock, and suppliers and Tesla staff were told on Wednesday in the notice, reviewed by Reuters, that production would be suspended for Wednesday and Thursday.
It did not give a reason for the stoppage at the plant, also known as the Gigafactory 3, which makes the Tesla Model 3 sedan and the Model Y crossover sport utility vehicle.
Many cities across China, including Shanghai, have been rolling out strict movement controls to stem the country's largest COVID-19 outbreak in two years. The measures have also caused factory shutdowns in parts of the country, putting pressure on supply chains.
Tesla did not have immediate comment. 
Its Shanghai factory produces cars for the China market and is also a crucial export hub to Germany and Japan. It delivered 56,515 vehicles in February, including 33,315 for export, according to the China Passenger Car Association.
That amounts to an average of around 2,018 vehicles a day.
It was not immediately clear whether the suspension of work would apply to other plant operations over the two days.
Two people briefed on the notice said they understood it applied to Tesla's general assembly lines. They declined to be identified because the information was not public.
The notice did not specify whether the measures would correspond to a loss of production, or whether Tesla could make up for any lost output.
Authorities in Shanghai have asked many residents not to leave their homes or work places for 48 hours to as long as 14 days as they conduct COVID tests or carry out contact tracing. 
In a separate notice issued on Wednesday that was also seen by Reuters, Tesla asked suppliers to estimate how many workers were needed to achieve full production and to provide details of workers affected by COVID restrictions. 
It also asked suppliers to prepare workers to live, sleep and eat at the factories in an arrangement similar to China's ""closed-loop management"" process. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn was allowed to resume some operations at its Shenzhen campus on Wednesday after it set up such an arrangement.

Tesla was alerted by one supplier last weekend that its production had been affected by COVID measures, said a person familiar with the matter. That supplier told Tesla that its stockpiles could only last for two days, the person said. 
Any protracted China lockdowns will further rattle Asian supply chains, OCBC economist Wellian Wiranto said in a research note, noting the southern manufacturing hub of Shenzhen alone produces 11% of China's exports.

Investing.com – NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) stock plunged 9% Wednesday after Britain's anti-trust regulator said the company’s proposed $8.6 billion purchase of Avast (LON:AVST) needed a deeper probe owing to competition concerns.
Avast stock was down 13% in London trading after the Competition and Markets Authority said the deal could lead to British customers getting a worse deal when looking for security software.
The CMA's findings are based on an initial investigation, and the regulator has called on the companies to submit proposals to allay its concerns or face an in-depth probe, according to Reuters.
NortonLifeLock said it did not plan to propose any remedies, calling the CMA's decision ""surprising"".
Under the deal announced in August, Avast shareholders were to get a mix of cash and newly issued shares. NortonLifeLock expected the merger to result in cost savings of $280 million.
If the deal fructifies, the new company will serve more than 500 million users including around 40 million direct customers.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks rose ahead of the opening in New York on Wednesday, with a sharp turnaround in Chinese markets providing an upbeat start to a day that will be dominated by the Federal Reserve.
By 9:50 AM ET, Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 385 points, or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 2.2%. All three indexes made solid gains on Tuesday as crude oil prices tumbled, taking the sting out of one of the factors that have most hurt markets in the last two weeks. 
The Fed is expected to hike the target rate for fed funds by 25 basis points to a maximum of 0.5%, from 0.25% currently. Analysts expect at least five more such hikes in the course of the year in an effort to bring down inflation which is running at a 40-year high. 
Retail sales data for February rose 0.3%, slightly below expectations for 0.4% for the month. For the 12 months ended in February, retail sales rose 17.6%.
Chinese ADRs are in turbocharged mode after the central bank and government issued coordinated statements pledging support to both the economy generally and financial markets in particular. Chinese cash stock markets had their biggest ever one-day gain in response, after a tumultuous few sessions overshadowed by Covid-19 lockdowns and the threat of forced delisting from U.S. exchanges. 
The prospects for a ceasefire in Ukraine appeared to brighten on Wednesday as Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that a neutrality model for Ukraine was on the table that would allow it to keep its own army - a big shift from Moscow's initial position of wanting to change the country's government and demilitarize it. 
Crude oil prices continued to slide, extending Tuesday's losses that were caused by fears for the strength of Chinese demand. China is currently enacting its most stringent lockdowns in two years to grapple with outbreaks of Covid in the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen and the northeastern province of Jilin. Public health measures have also forced Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to shut its Shanghai factory for two days, according to the company.
U.S. crude futures fell 0.4% at $96.00 a barrel, further weighed down by a new forecast from the International Energy Agency, which said global demand in 2022 could fall by one million barrels a day on average due to the effects of the war and the Western sanctions accompanying it. 
Gold futures were down 0.7% at $1.915 an ounce.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday as a relatively weak retail sales report for February encouraged hopes that the Federal Reserve won't talk too tough after its policy meeting which ends later in the day.
Official data showed that retail sales rose only 0.3% last month rather than the 0.4% expected, while there was a bigger shortfall in core retail sales, where growth of 0.2% was well below expectations of 0.9%. While the monthly numbers are still erratic due to shifting consumption patterns caused by successive waves of the pandemic, they appear to indicate a slowdown from the much more robust spending last year, when households were still enjoying the benefits of stimulus checks. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 460 points, or 1.4% at 34,004 points, the first time it has traded above 34,000 in nearly two weeks. The broader-based S&P 500 was up 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.8%.
The early mood was also lifted by events abroad, with Russia's Foreign Ministry appearing to make further concessions in peace talks with Ukraine and China's government and central bank intervening verbally to prop up local stock markets after a dismal last few trading sessions. Chinese ADRs advanced broadly, with  Alibaba  ADRs (NYSE:BABA) gaining 16%,  Pinduoduo  ADRs (NASDAQ:PDD) gaining 34% and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs gaining 21%.
The day is, however, set to be dominated by the Federal Reserve's meeting and Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference at 2:30 PM ET. A 25 basis point rate hike - the first in over three years - is widely expected, with a minority still betting on a 50 basis point hike. The latter would signal greater urgency in bringing down an inflation rate that is running at its highest in over 40 years. Of most importance, however, will be the Fed's guidance in the form of its so-called 'dot-plot' of future rate expectations, and in the guidance offered by Powell. 
Powell is likely to highlight not only the inflationary impact of past stimulus and current labor market tightness, but also the risks to growth from sustained high energy prices and global economic disruption due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier made a virtual address to Congress, calling again for a No-Fly Zone over Ukraine. The Biden administration has rejected that on the grounds that it would lead directly to military conflict between the U.S. and Russia, the world's two biggest nuclear powers.
Among individual movers early on, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock surged 7.4% after it said that Chief Executive Kevin Johnson will step down at the end of the month, to be replaced as interim CEO by his predecessor - now chairman - Howard Schultz.

The investment, which is part of Exor's non-core trading activity on equity, makes it the third-largest shareholder in Veon.
The news was initially reported by Italian daily MF, which said Exor rounded up its holdings at the beginning of March, passing a 5% threshold and triggering disclosure obligations.
Exor declined to comment.
Veon's largest shareholder is LetterOne, the investment vehicle of Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman. Fridman stepped down from LetterOne's board on March 3, following his inclusion on the European Union's list of individuals sanctioned following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Veon's CEO Kaan Terzioglu repeated in a letter to investors on Tuesday that the company itself is not subject to sanctions.

Veon gets 30% of its revenue from Russia, but also operates networks in several other countries, including Ukraine, where it operates Kyivstar.
Veon shares have lost half their value since mid-February, when the war in Ukraine started, and are down almost 70% since October.

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock traded 2.2% higher in premarket Wednesday on reports the Pentagon is likely to order more non-stealthy F-15EX jets in its next budget.
According to Bloomberg, the U.S. Air Force will request 24 non-stealthy F-15EX jets, up from 14 planned for the ongoing year that ends September 30.
The EX model carries more ordnance than Lockheed’s F-35 and is estimated to be cheaper to fly.
Boeing touts the jet as having a digital backbone, open system architecture, and one that’s a ready-now replacement for the F-15C. It has the capacity to carry hypersonic weapons, making it a key element of the U.S. Air Force’s tactical fighter fleet, according to Boeing.
The stock had closed 2.5% higher Tuesday after various airlines said travel demand remained robust, notwithstanding the ongoing conflict in Europe. They said they will trim flight frequencies to remain on track toward profits even as fuel prices rise.
Delta Air (NYSE:DAL) raised its annual guidance for the current quarter. The airline now sees revenue for the March quarter at 78% of 2019 levels, an improvement from the 72-76% forecast it gave two months ago.
In another boost for the stock, StreetInsider said Baird analyst Peter Arment has added Boeing to the firm’s list of bullish fresh pick stocks. The 737-MAX deliveries in China are getting closer with analysts expecting it to happen by April."
862,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 09:21AM ET</span>",Your connected car knows you. The tussle for that data's hitting high gear,"By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) - Where you go. What you pass. Where you stop. What you listen to. What you watch. Your good habits. Your bad habits. 
Companies in Europe and beyond are vying for control of the crown jewels of the connected car era: your vehicle's data. 
The contest is entering a pivotal phase as EU regulators look to hammer out the world's first laws for the ballooning industry around web-enabled vehicles, pitting carmakers against a coalition of insurers, leasing companies and repair shops.
European Commission sources said the EU executive should launch an industry consultation on in-vehicle data this week which could lead to legislation later this year - the first of its kind globally. 
Many companies view data as the gold of the new wired world, though for some it's more akin to air or water.
""If you don't have access to data in the future, eventually you'll be squeezed out,"" says Tim Albertsen, CEO of ALD, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s car leasing division, which commands millions of vehicles. 
""You'll not be efficient, you'll not have the right services, you just can't operate at the end of the day.""
Car manufacturers, guarding their gatekeeper role in accessing data from their vehicles, have resisted specific regulations for in-vehicle data, saying that protecting consumers is paramount. 
""Europe's auto industry is committed to giving access to the data generated by the vehicles it produces,"" said a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). ""However, uncontrolled access to in-vehicle data poses major safety, (cyber) security, data protection and privacy threats."" 
Yet the companies lined up against them say limiting or charging what they deem unfair amounts for access to in-vehicle data could kill off competition for carmakers who already operate their own leasing firms, car subscription services and repair shops.
In some cases, they say carmakers are already restricting access to vehicle data and charging independent repair shops more for access. 
""The manufacturers are in direct contact with the vehicle, so they get all the data,"" says Sylvia Gotzen, CEO of the International Federation of Automotive Aftermarket Distributors, or FIGIEFA, which is part of a broader alliance of repair shops and parts makers that employs 3.5 million people in Europe. 
""They get the full buffet and all we get is some crumbs.""
CARMAKERS: WE SHARE DATA
Vehicle manufacturers have big plans for data.
For example Stellantis, the world's No. 4 carmaker, expects to generate 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) annually by 2030 from software products and subscription services. Such offerings are also central to General Motors (NYSE:GM)' plan to double annual revenue to around $280 billion.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said data is becoming the ""key source of value creation and innovation"", adding that customers have ""full control"" over it, citing vehicle security and customer sovereignty as its main focuses.
BMW rejected suggestions it was withholding data. 
The German company said it can share nearly 100 data points with third parties if drivers requested it and could make more available if companies prove a real business need for them and a willingness to take responsibility for cybersecurity risks. Auto supplier groups like FIGIEFA say carmakers can access thousands of data points. 
A BMW spokesperson said the carmaker would like all sides to sit down with a mediator such as the European Commission and hammer out a list of data points that is acceptable to everyone.
Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares told reporters on Friday that the carmaker aggregated data, which cost money, and so needed to be paid for it. He cited, as an example, data that Stellantis sells to cities to measure how often anti-lock braking systems are engaged at junctions and gauge which are the most dangerous. 
""It is not only collecting the data, it is also about crunching the data in a way that is going to create value for somebody willing to pay for it,"" Tavares said. 
'DATA IS ABSOLUTELY KEY' 
Yet other companies in the auto ecosystem, such as ALD, say they want the European Union to ensure a level playing field
ALD, in the process of buying Dutch rival LeasePlan to give it a combined fleet of 3.5 million vehicles, has a car-sharing platform that needs to run diagnostics, read the odometer, check the fuel gauge and switch cars between users.
It also offers an insurance product that lowers your premium based on good driving behaviour - monitoring how you accelerate and brake. 
""Access to data is absolutely key for us to provide the services we do today,"" CEO Albertsen said. 
To extract car data, ALD plugs a wireless ""dongle"" into the vehicle that transmits information to an in-house developed platform that it pays U.S. startup Vinli to operate. Carmakers running similar services get that data directly, putting ALD at a competitive disadvantage, Albertsen said.
Stellantis, for instance, offers car sharing and rentals through its Free2Move unit. Volkswagen could take over rental company Europcar to take advantage of car sharing and subscription services.
And most major carmakers have their own leasing units, like BMW's Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Mercedes-Benz's Athlon.
ALD's Albertsen said major fleet customers were willing to pay for the data but that he wanted regulations to ensure ALD's car-sharing unit paid the same as, for instance, Stellantis charges its own Free2Move division.
RISKS FOR REPAIR SHOPS
Insurers and car repair shops say it is paramount that the EU let drivers choose who accesses their vehicles' data.
    ""There is a need to regulate this, as you cannot leave this in the hands of car manufacturers,"" said Nicolas Jeanmart, industry group Insurance Europe's head of personal and general insurance. ""It should be for each driver to decide what they want to do with their data.""
FIGIEFA's Gotzen said that would allow car owners to link their preferred repair shop to their car and have it run remote diagnostics if they had car trouble, instead of relying solely on the manufacturer's recommendations.
""All of this is technically possible now, but we are hampered because car manufacturers prevent us from doing this,"" she said.
She said FIGIEFA's members are willing to adopt carmakers' cybersecurity processes and requirements, but added cybersecurity could serve as an excuse for carmakers to restrict access.

Richard Knubben, deputy director general of Leaseurope, which represents Europe's leasing and car rental firms, said the longer the EU took to legislate car data, the more independent repair shops are at risk of going out of business because they lack access to it.
""By the time we get legislation we may already be stuck with an imbalance that we can't fix anymore,"" Knubben said.

(Reuters) - US Foods Holding (NYSE:USFD) Corp is interviewing potential candidates for its board as the food distributor tries to fend off a challenge from activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management, two people familiar with the matter said.
The company has compiled a list of director candidates and has been reaching out to them, the sources said. US Foods could try to shake up its 10-member board to persuade investors to back its directors after Sachem Head last month nominated seven candidates.
The sources did not give the identities and number of the board candidates US Foods is considering. It was also not clear when the company may make a final decision on the matter.
A representative for US Foods declined to comment.
A representative for Sachem Head declined to comment.
A month ago, US Foods split its chief executive officer and chairman roles, a move generally seen as trying to appeal to shareholders. CEO Pietro Satriano retained his board seat, while Robert Dutkowsky, the lead independent director, was named non-executive chair.
Sachem Head, which owns 8.7% of the company, has been invested in US Foods since 2018. Last month, its portfolio manager, Scott Ferguson, wrote in a letter to other shareholders that there was ""deep-seated resistance to real change at US Foods, and, in fact, a lack of acknowledgement that there is even a problem."" He said new directors are needed to hold management accountable.
Ferguson said he believes the company is lagging behind peers and has not improved operations as promised. US Foods, in response, said it profitably grew market share and expanded core earnings margins in the four years leading up to the pandemic and has since invested roughly $60 million to hire more salespeople to grow market share.
US Foods, valued at $7.9 billion as of the close of trading on Tuesday, has said that in December, Sachem Head turned down the company's offer to settle the fight by inviting Ferguson onto its board and allowing the hedge fund to help select another director.

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) -China is allowing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn's Shenzhen operations and construction sites in Shanghai to resume work on condition that their employees live and work in a bubble arrangement against COVID-19, offering some respite for firms. 
Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is among the companies that called production halts to comply with COVID strictures as China battles its largest outbreak since early 2020, fuelling concern over more disruptions to global supply chains.
U.S. electric car maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is suspending production at its Shanghai factory for two days, Reuters reported on Wednesday, and companies from Chinese automaker BYD to KFC operator Yum China have flagged a hit to their operations.
Manufacturers in Guangdong province, one of the country's key export hubs and home to Shenzhen, told Reuters that factory shutdowns were causing lags in deliveries, while logistics difficulties were making it difficult to ship goods to overseas customers.
Ship owners and logistics firms said the queues of container ships outside major Chinese ports were lengthening, and while these ports remained open and vessels continued to dock, congestion was building and some container ships were re-routing to avoid expected delays.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) on Wednesday said it would as a precautionary measure pause production for another day in Changchun, but resume production in Shanghai after a 48 hour suspension, saying the current ""volatile"" COVID situation mean that it had to plan on a daily basis.
On Wednesday, Foxconn said it was able to restart some production and operations in the southern city of Shenzhen after adopting a ""closed-loop management"" system. 
The system used during the recent Winter Olympics in Beijing kept event personnel tightly sealed off from the public, with regular COVID-19 tests for those within.
It was largely seen as successful in preventing the spread of coronavirus at the Olympics, or in the community. 
""Some operations have been able to restart and some production is being carried out,"" Foxconn said in a statement, adding that the system at its Shenzhen facilities subjected employees living there to the required health measures.
""This process, which can only be done on campuses that include both employee housing and production facilities, adheres to strict industry guidelines and close-loop management policies issued by the Shenzhen government,"" it added. 
On Monday, authorities in the commercial hub of Shanghai, which has also imposed tough COVID curbs, said construction projects there would have to adopt a similar system to resume work. 
Still, such a system is unlikely to be feasible for many companies and large-scale disruption to manufacturing is expected as China tightens curbs. 
The Shenzhen Cross-border E-commerce Association, which groups about 2,800 retailers using platforms such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), said its members felt the pain of supply disruptions. 
""There will be some short-term impact on cross-border platforms like Amazon, because we can't sell right now, otherwise buyers will suffer ... as the goods won't be delivered efficiently,"" said association chief Wang Xin.
Justin Jia, general manager of Baimi Tech, which makes equipment for printers from the manufacturing hub of Dongguan, said he was having issues with delivering internationally as his local provider suspended services this week. 

Despite the pains, he supported China's zero-COVID policy.
""If we just abruptly drop this policy, there's the possibility of large-scale transmission,"" he said. ""I feel like it's necessary.""

Investing.com – Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) stock traded 5% higher in premarket Wednesday. The company said Kevin Johnson will step down as chief executive and former long-time CEO Howard Schultz will replace him, albeit on an interim basis as the coffee chain searches for a successor.
The stock also got a boost from J.P. Morgan’s upgrade to ‘overweight’ with a target of $101, up over 21% from its previous close. It cited attractive valuation as a reason for its optimism on the stock.
Johnson will vacate his position and that of board director, with effect from April 4, and will continue in an advisory role to the company through September.
The top-level change comes in at a time when the company is being accused of thwarting attempts to form unions at its various stores in the U.S while it undergoes pandemic-induced upheavals.
Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, has prevailed in six out of the seven unionization votes held at corporate-run Starbucks sites in recent months, establishing a labor foothold at the company. The group has petitioned to represent workers at over a hundred more Starbucks locations, Bloomberg said.
The company is facing soaring costs of raw materials, wages and logistics. Last month, it said its annual earnings per share will fall 4-6% compared to its previous estimate of no more than 4%. The cut in guidance followed after first quarter results fell short of estimates.
The company is raising its wages this year across the U.S. to $17 an hour, one among many retailers to be doing so in their struggle to retain staff.
It also faced a public outcry last month in China for raising coffee prices, the first time in over three years.

Vice Premier Liu He said Beijing would roll out support for the Chinese economy as well as be cautious with measures for capital markets. 
The Xinhua news agency also cited Liu as saying, at a meeting of the Financial Stability and Development Committee under the State Council, that regulators would coordinate better with their counterparts in Hong Kong.
The comments came a day after China stocks slumped to 21-month lows and mainland firms listed in Hong Kong plumbed 2008 lows.
Chinese stocks have been pummelled this year by rising domestic COVID-19 cases, fears about a blowback on China from its dealings with the sanctions-hit Russia, and continued regulatory crackdowns, including the risk of more mainland firms being delisted by U.S. exchanges.
Liu's assurances helped the Hang Seng index claw back all the ground lost on Tuesday and more. The HSI surged more than 9% to above the 20,000-point mark.
The Hang Seng Tech Index logged its biggest daily gain of 22%, recovering a good deal of the ground it had ceded since March 10 as regulatory fears piled up.
""It's quite positive, at least for the moment, as Liu addressed some key concerns in the market, especially regarding the regulatory crackdown,"" said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura. ""Liu also demands the PBOC to take action, so I believe the PBOC will do some easing in the next couple of months.""
The blue-chip CSI300 index gained the most since July 2020, rising 4.3%, while the Shanghai Composite Index added 3.5% and the Hong Kong-listed China Enterprises Index gained 12.5%.
The CSI300 had lost 19% in the year to date through Tuesday's close. 
Among Hong Kong index heavyweights, Meituan jumped 32.1%, while Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group soared 23% and 27%, respectively, logging their biggest daily gains. Other stocks caught in China's regulatory crosshairs, such as education, also rallied, with New Oriental Education & Technology Group rising 37%.
Liu's comments also helped to ease worries that encouraging economic data for January and February were leading to complacency among policymakers in Beijing.
The central bank surprised markets on Tuesday by not cutting one of its key lending rates, despite growing risks to the economic outlook, including mounting COVID-19 disruptions, increasing global risks from the Ukraine conflict and a weak property market.
Liu also said China encourages long-term institutional investors to increase stock holdings.
""It is quite reasonable for the Chinese government to properly step in, maintain the basic stability of the stock market and avoid further decline,"" Zhang Ming, Deputy Director of Institute of Finance & Banking at Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in a note on Tuesday.
Zhang said this round of declines came against a very complex background, hit by ""external geopolitical shocks, China-U.S. game and malicious short-selling by international investors."" 
JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) downgraded 28 Chinese stocks listed in the United States and Hong Kong on Monday, citing ""China's geopolitical risks"" as ""more and more countries and corporates impose sanctions on Russia.""
""China's tech stocks are underpinned by value, while Liu's speech ignited the rebound,"" said Xie Chen, fund manager at Shanghai Jianwen Investment Management Co.
However, Nomura's Lu said markets might continue to be worried that China is getting isolated due to the Russia-Ukraine war. 
""A meeting cannot solve all issues, given the economy is not in good shape,"" Yin Peixin, investment vice director at RBH (Shanghai) Asset Management Co said.
The jump in China shares lifted broader Asian markets, which also benefited from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's comments on Wednesday that peace talks were sounding more realistic but more time was needed.
China's yuan also reacted to Liu's comments and the sharp rebounds in the stock market. The yuan extended early gains and hit a high of 6.3460 per dollar at one point in the afternoon session, up nearly 0.4%.
Mainland China reported 1,952 new confirmed COVID-19 cases on March 15, the national health authority said on Wednesday, dropping from a two-year high caseload of 3,602 a day earlier.
A recent surge in infections had raised concerns about the rising economic costs of its tough measures to contain the disease.

Later on Wednesday, Xinhau news agency reported China was putting a planned property tax trial this year on ice, citing the finance ministry.
The real estate sector, a key economic growth driver, has slumped as Beijing's campaign to reduce high debt levels triggered a liquidity crisis at some major property developers, resulting in bond defaults and projects being shelved or left unfinished.

(Reuters) -NortonLifeLock's $8.6 billion purchase of Avast hit a snag on Wednesday after Britain's anti-trust regulator said it would launch a deeper investigation into the proposed cybersecurity merger following competition concerns.
NortonLifeLock (NASDAQ:NLOK) in August proposed to buy London-listed rival Avast in a cash-and-stock cyber deal to create a leader in consumer security software catering to more than 500 million customers. 
Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal could harm competition and lead to British customers getting a worse deal when looking for security software, sending Avast shares tumbling 11%. 
The CMA's findings are based on an initial investigation and the regulator has called on the companies to submit proposals to allay its concerns or face an in-depth probe. 
NortonLifeLock said on Wednesday it did not plan to propose any 'Phase 1' remedies, calling the CMA's decision ""surprising"". 
Avast said it remained of the view that the deal ""will only benefit consumers in the UK"".
NortonLifeLock said the investigation would delay the completion of the deal, which is now expected to close in mid-to-late 2022 and not April 4 as expected. 
The deal was initially expected to close last month, but the Arizona-based company was awaiting regulatory nods from the United Kingdom and Spain. It later got approval from Spain. 
""We are living more of our lives online and it is vital that people have access to competitive cyber safety software when seeking to protect themselves and their families,"" CMA Executive Director David Stewart said in a statement.
The deal, which would marry NortonLifeLock's strength in identity theft protection and Avast's privacy, has already received the green light in the United States and Germany.
Founded in Prague, Czech Republic, Avast is a pioneer of ""freemium"" software, whereby basic applications are free and subscribers pay for premium features. 

NortonLifeLock, previously known as Symantec, was renamed after it sold its enterprise business to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) in 2019. It has a larger premium business selling products to consumers to combat viruses, spyware and malware. 
NortonLifeLock's stock was down about 6% in premarket trading.

(Reuters) - SiFive, Inc., a RISC-V chip technology startup in Silicon Valley, said on Wednesday it raised $175 million in its latest round of funding and is now valued at $2.5 billion.
RISC-V is an instruction set architecture (ISA), a base for building chips that defines what kind of software can run on the chips. Arm Ltd's ARM and Intel's x86 are the dominant ISAs used today for general-purpose processors, or the brains of computers, and are proprietary.
By comparison, RISC-V is open standard and free to use. Countries like China seeking to build their chip independence have been pushing to develop RISC-V chips.
SiFive's founders invented the RISC-V ISA in the labs of University of California, Berkeley. The company's business model is to build designs using RISC-V and charge money for the designs. Last year it released the P550 - a chip core design that aims to challenge Arm's dominance in smartphone chips, and said it would pair with  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC)'s factories to make the design available to hardware makers.
Last month as part of the launch of its $1 billion fund to support companies with disruptive technologies and build up its foundry business, Intel also laid out its path to support the Risc-V ecosystem.
""For the x86, the compute leader on the planet, to put their arm around SiFive and RISC-V and say, we're going to be investing hundreds of millions of dollars ... I think it's historically important for RISC-V,"" said SiFive President and CEO Patrick Little.

The latest round brings SiFive's total funding to over $350 million and was led by global investment firm Coatue. Existing investors Intel Capital, Sutter Hill, and some others joined this latest round. SiFive also counts SK Hynix Inc and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Ventures as investors.
""We're starting now to move towards institutional investors that are on Wall Street that will pull us to IPO,"" Little said.

Investing.com –  Lockheed Martin  stock (NYSE:LMT) slipped 0.7% in premarket Wednesday on a Bloomberg report that Pentagon will request 35% fewer F-35 stealth jets in the next budget.  
According to the report, orders for 61 F-35s are likely to be placed with the defense contractor in the next budget, 33 less than originally planned.
The current budget contains orders for 85 jets, and next year's were due to rise to 94.
The proposed slowdown in purchases may be controversial given that it comes in at the time of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and raises questions around the administration’s commitment to a program projected to cost $398 billion in development and acquisition plus an additional $1.2 trillion to operate and maintain the fleet over 66 years, according to Bloomberg. 
Talks with Lockheed for the next F-35 contract -- for about 400 planes -- are going slower than anticipated, the news agency said. The fighter jet program remains hobbled by flawed execution of a crucial software upgrade and hardware capabilities that’s estimated to cost $14 billion.
The F-35 is currently being deployed to Eastern Europe. German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht announced Monday that Germany would buy 35 of the warplanes. The reduction in the Pentagon's orders for next year thus arguably create a space that may be filled by an upgrade to the airforce of a key NATO ally.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japan's top firms have offered pay rises of more than 2% at annual wage talks that wrapped up on Monday, marking an uptick from the previous year but still falling short of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's request for a bigger increase to spur growth.
Instead, Japanese workers now look set for another lean year. Wages, which have barely budged relative to the cost of living since the 1990s, remain one of the most pressing problems for the world's third-largest economy, forcing households to save rather than spend.
Kishida, who has called for a wider distribution of wealth, pressed companies to boost pay by 3% or more at the annual ""shunto"" spring wage talks with unions. While the negotiations are less important than they were decades ago, they still set the tone for much of the economy.
The average increase for big companies won't be known for a few more days, but economists said it looked likely to be north of 2%, a bump from last year's eight-year low of 1.86%.
""Today's outcome was a little stronger than expected,"" said Hisashi Yamada, senior economist at Japan Research Institute. ""Still, the pace of gains turned out to be moderate and it was not strong enough to boost the overall economy.""
Yamada said he expects the overall increase to be 2-2.5%.
Conglomerates Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) Ltd and Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp agreed with their unions to raise overall wages by 2.6% and 2.5%, respectively.
Automakers have already agreed to meet union demands in full, led by  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Honda Motor Co, although they did not disclose rises in percentage terms.
Any boost for workers and the economy is likely to be offset by recent increases in fuel and food prices, economists said.
RIPPLE EFFECT
""The question for us is how much of a ripple effect will this have on small- and medium-sized companies,"" said Tatsuya Sekiguchi, deputy executive committee chair at Tokyo Union, a labour group that represents workers who don't belong to bigger unions.
""If pay rises only at the big companies there isn't much meaning for us."" 
Kishida and Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda have stressed the need for wage hikes in achieving the 2% inflation target. Still, the premier's target of 3% seemed ""too ambitious"", according to Masamichi Adachi, an economist at UBS Securities.
Companies reliant on domestic demand were particularly hurt by COVID-19 related measures, making it difficult for them to increase wages, Adachi said. 
The Rengo trade union confederation went so far as to call for a 4% increase. But, as ever, Japanese firms remain cautious. 
While corporate Japan is sitting on a record $2.8 trillion in cash and deposits, managers point to the Ukraine crisis, spiking oil prices, a weakening yen and the pandemic as reasons to save money.
""It is difficult to assume the shunto wage hikes will help boost private consumption,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.
Some companies are shifting away from uniform wage hikes towards a more varied approach on remuneration. More of them are adopting merit-based wages, rather than seniority-oriented pay, to lure skilled talent.
The move coincides with structural changes in the labour market. About 40% of workers consist of part-time staff and contract workers, double the proportion seen in 1990, many of whom do not belong to labour unions.

Japan's economic growth likely ground to a near halt this quarter as coronavirus curbs and supply disruptions threaten to derail the country's economic recovery, a recent Reuters poll of economists showed.[ECILT/JP]

Investing.com – Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock traded 4.7% higher in premarket Wednesday on Bernstein upgrading it to ‘outperform’ with a $94 target, around 29% higher than its previous close of $73.11.
Analyst Mark Li earlier rated the stock ‘perform’ with a $58 target.
The stock is down around 18% in the last year against NASDAQ Composite's loss of 3.8% and 7.4% gains in S&P 500. It has lost 27% in 2022 so far.
Li said macro concerns have prompted a selloff, but a correction to the memory market, if any, won't be prolonged and won't change the structure, according to The Fly.
The analyst's base case has the DRAM cycle bottoming in six months. The analyst ruled out notable supply disruption or demand destruction in the near term due to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.
DRAM or dynamic random access memory chips, which go into both personal computers and servers, accounted for 72% of the company’s FY21 revenue. The pandemic provided a big boost to the industry as people and corporates pivoted to digital and demand for devices grew. That demand, though reduced from its peak, stays elevated. 
Li noted that valuations in the global memory chip sector have fallen, ""providing a favorable risk/reward tradeoff now.""
The company will declare its second-quarter numbers on March 29.

Investing.com – Shares and ADRs of US-listed Chinese companies were rebounding strongly in premarket Wednesday on reports that the regulators in the two countries are nearing a cooperation plan.

The bounce back is still small compared to the billions of dollars investors have lost in Chinese shares over the last 9-10 months ever since the Chinese authorities began a crackdown on their online firms. The truce between the world’s two largest economies will also mean a closure of that action.
Amid record-low interest rates and unprecedented liquidity over the last few years, several Chinese firms have tapped American investors to list on NYSE and Nasdaq. Many of them are internet consumer companies like Alibaba and JD.com, holding troves of data on Chinese consumers. Authorities in the mainland haven’t been comfortable with the data these companies may have to share with the US regulators to meet compliance norms.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said last week that US-listed securities for five Chinese companies are at risk of delisting. Worries about forced stock delistings from US exchanges had added to investors’ concerns about economic growth.

TOKYO (Reuters) -The U.S.-based aircraft leasing firm owned by Japan's Marubeni Corp and Mizuho Leasing Co Ltd has recovered two of the 12 aircraft it has been leasing to Russian airlines, it said on Wednesday.
Connecticut-based Aircastle Ltd company is one of multiple lessors scrambling to retrieve aircraft leased to Russian airlines before sanctions, imposed in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, take effect on March 28.
So far it has retrieved two of the aircraft, an Aircastle spokesperson said, adding it had leased aircraft to six Russian airlines as of February. 
""It is our best intention that all Russia-based leases be terminated and that all aircraft be returned to our possession,"" the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson declined to give further details, describing the situation as ""difficult and fluid"".
Russia this week passed a law allowing the country's airlines to place airplanes leased from foreign companies on the country's aircraft register - a manoeuvre likely to stoke Western fears of a mass default involving hundreds of jetliners.
Russian airlines have almost 780 leased jets, with 515 leased from abroad.

The Dublin-based aircraft leasing arm of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group  (NYSE:SMFG), another major Japanese bank, has said it has 35 aircraft leased to five Russian airlines.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Fears over the Federal Reserve's hawkish shift have combined with geopolitical uncertainty to push the S&P 500 into a correction this year, yet historical data suggests tighter monetary policy has often been accompanied by solid gains in stocks. 
That offers a glimmer of good news to investors, who widely expect the central bank to announce the first interest rate increase in more than three years on Wednesday and are pricing some 180 basis points of tightening by the end of the year.
The S&P 500 has returned an average 7.7% in the first year the Fed raises rates, according to a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) study of 13 hiking cycles since 1955. 
An analysis of 12 rate hike cycles overall by Truist Advisory Services found the S&P 500's posted a total return at an average annualized rate of 9.4% during the length of such cycles, showing positive returns in 11 of those periods. 
""Equities have generally risen during periods where the Fed funds rate is rising because this is normally paired with a healthy economy and rising profits,"" Keith Lerner, Truist's co-chief investment officer, wrote in a report. 
Many investors worry that this year may be more complicated than most, however, as markets are faced with soaring inflation which stands to be worsened by surging commodity prices in the wake of Russia's war with Ukraine. 
The uncertainty has presented a dilemma for the central bank, with some investors worried policymakers could push the economy into a recession if it raises rates too far as it seeks to tamp down inflation. 
To be sure, rate increases have tended to weigh on stocks in the near-term. An analysis by Evercore ISI of four hiking cycles found that the S&P 500 fell an average of 4% in the first month following the start of the cycle. 
But the benchmark index was higher six months into the cycle by an average of 3%, and 5% higher on average after 12 months, according to Evercore. 
""The Fed doesn't want a recession and it generally takes a whole lot of hiking before the economy is put into position to potentially feel a recession,"" said Julian Emanuel, senior managing director at Evercore ISI. 
Emanuel said Evercore's ""base case"" is that the market is ""really in the midst of making a near-term bottom that is more likely to deliver the kind of six- and 12-month returns that a typical Fed rate hike cycle has engendered previously."" 
However, with the Fed starting to tighten monetary policy after offering massive support to help the economy endure the coronavirus pandemic, some investors are prepared for potential rockiness. 
The S&P 500 has slid more than 10% to start 2022, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq confirmed it was in a bear market, dropping over 20% from its November all-time high. Tech and growth stocks have underperformed, as the rise in bond yields pressures the value of future cash flows that those stocks valuations' rely on. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) equity strategist Michael Wilson said that if the Fed ""is successful in orchestrating a soft landing"" for the economy as it raises rates this year, it could lead to much higher bond yields, that ""would simply weigh on equity valuations."" 

""The bottom line is the Fed is going to start removing the punch bowl this week,"" Wilson said in a note this week. 
""The question for equity investors is how far can they get on rate hikes given the already slowing growth and additional shock from the war?""

883,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 05:55AM ET</span>","Standard Bank aims for net zero by 2050, activists press for more","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Top African lender Standard Bank has ruled out funding all new coal-fired power plants and most oil-fired plants as part of plans to reach net zero-emissions by 2050, but campaigners said it could still do more to cut emissions.
More financial services firms are setting net-zero targets to combat global warming but are under pressure to provide more details on how to get there, including making short-term cuts.
Standard Bank, a top oil and gas lender in Africa, has drawn fire from activists in the past. They said its new fossil fuel strategy, published on Wednesday, did not guarantee emissions reductions or rule out backing projects such as a planned Ugandan oil pipeline. 
Under its new strategy, the bank bans funding for new coal-fired power plants, which it has not financed since 2009, and expansion of existing plants. New mines would be possible in limited circumstances. 
New oil-fired plants or expansion plans would also only be possible in limited circumstances and it would reduce loans for oil exploration and production by 5% by 2030, the bank said.
It said its exposure to gas would grow to 0.91% of its loan book by 2030, before falling to 0.4% by mid-century, saying gas was a transition fuel as it emits less carbon than oil or coal. 
Chief Executive Sim Tshabalala said Africa needed to develop its economies, ensure reliable power supplies and cut poverty. 
""A total or immediate ban on further transitional projects in Africa in order to help reduce environmental pressure in much richer regions would be a cost too far,"" he said.
But campaigners say continuing to fund fossil fuels, including gas, will harm developing countries by driving climate change and make them more reliant on fossil fuels.
Standard Bank said it wanted to mobilise up to 300 billion rand ($19.9 billion) in sustainable finance - potentially including for transition fuels like gas - by the end of 2026 from a targeted 40 billion rand in 2022. 
It set targets for reducing lending to coal, oil and gas as a percentage of its loan book by 2050, and its strategy put it ahead of some local peers.
But Standard Bank did not guarantee an absolute reduction in its financed emissions, unlike global peers such as HSBC and UBS, so lending in this area could grow if its loan portfolio expanded.
Maaike Beenes, an campaigner at BankTrack, which tracks bank finance activities, said the absence of near-term emissions targets and other caveats meant Standard Bank's policy fell short of even some local rivals.

""That makes it even more disappointing that Standard Bank seems to have missed the opportunity to become a climate front runner with the policy announced today.""

884,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 05:42AM ET</span>",Explainer - Amazon's battle with Reliance for India retail supremacy,"By Abhirup Roy and Aditya Kalra
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - For more than a year, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and India's Future Group have been locked in a complex legal stand-off that has stalled Future's $3.4 billion sale of assets to rival Reliance Industries, the country's biggest conglomerate.
Amazon and Future agreed to out-of-court settlement discussions this month, but the two sides told India's Supreme Court on March 15 they had failed to resolve the matter.
Following is a guide to the dispute.
THE TRIGGER 
In 2019, Amazon and Future, the No. 2 player in India behind market leader Reliance, became business partners when the U.S. company invested $200 million in a unit of the Indian group. 
That deal, Amazon argues, came with non-compete clauses that prohibited Future from selling retail assets to certain rivals, including Reliance, run by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani. The deal's terms call for disputes to be settled by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
In 2020, Future - hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic - decided to sell assets to Reliance. 
Amazon then approached Singapore arbitrators and successfully stopped the sale. Both parties have also challenged each other in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court.
THEIR ARGUMENTS
Amazon argues various agreements signed in 2019 with Future gave it special rights over Future's retail assets, some of which it had also hoped to ultimately own should India's rules for foreign investors be eased. The potential Future-Reliance deal ""destroys"" the latter prospect, the U.S. company has said.
Future denies any wrongdoing, saying Amazon is illegally seeking to exert control on Future's retail business. Future Retail - the group's flagship retail arm - says it faces liquidation if the Reliance deal fails. 
THE STAKES
If Amazon were to prevail, that could set it up to become a bigger force than Reliance in India's $900 billion retail market.
Reliance has 1,100 supermarkets, while Future has around 1,500 and both are expanding fast into e-commerce.
Amazon has invested $6.5 billion in India - a key growth market where it is a leading e-commerce player. The Future partnership had helped Amazon to boost its online portfolio of grocery deliveries by integrating the Indian company's stores on its website.
Keeping Future away from Reliance chimes with Amazon's efforts to combat Ambani's growth plans. In one confidential legal filing, Amazon said Reliance's consolidated position with Future ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"".
THE WRANGLING
Future last year complained to India's antitrust agency that Amazon was making incorrect and contradictory submissions about the intent of the 2019 deal.
Amazon said it never concealed any information, but last December the watchdog suspended its approval of the 2019 deal with Future, saying there was ""a deliberate design on the part of Amazon to suppress the actual scope"" of the deal and its interest in Future's retail businesses.
In a setback for the U.S. giant, an Indian court in January halted the Singapore arbitration proceedings between the two sides in light of the antitrust decision.
RELIANCE' SEIZURE OF STORES AND FAILED TALKS
On Feb. 25, Reliance, which had not played a public role in the dispute, suddenly took control of hundreds of Future stores, citing non-payment of rent it was due.
On March 3, Amazon extended an olive branch during a Supreme Court hearing, saying the ""whirlpool"" of litigation must end and proposed talks which Future agreed to.

On March 15, the two sides told the court the talks had failed. Earlier in the day, Amazon ran newspaper ads accusing the Indian firms of transferring the stores ""in a clandestine manner by playing a fraud on the constitutional courts in India."" Reliance hasn't commented, while Future denies any wrongdoing.
Sources said the talks collapsed because Amazon wanted at least $200 million - the amount it had invested in Future's unit - returned. But the Indian company said it wasn't in a financial position to do so.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn forecast an up to 3% fall in revenue for the year in what could be its first annual sales decline in six years, as a shortage of chips squeezes smartphone production and demand cools following a surge during the pandemic.
The Taiwanese company, which had stopped production in China earlier this week to comply with government curbs, said separately that it had restarted some production and operations at its Shenzhen campus after meeting government conditions for staff to live and work in a bubble.
The stoppages from Foxconn - the world's largest contract electronics maker - and other companies including Japan's  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) have fuelled concerns over how global supply chains could be impacted as China deals with its biggest spike in COVID-19 infections since early 2020.
Chairman Liu Young-way said on a post-earnings call on Wednesday that Foxconn would only have better clarity on supply chain uncertainty in the second half of the year. 
He said the record-high revenue in 2021, boosted by booming electronics demand following the pandemic, would lead to ""stable"" business this year due to a high base last year. 
""The pandemic has not eased, inflation is high and global politics are getting tense - these all further complicate supply and demand and lead to great uncertainty to our outlook,"" Liu said, calling 2022 a ""very challenging year"". 
Still, Liu said he was ""cautiously positive"" about the company's 2022 sales outlook, citing continuous growth from sectors including 5G smartphones and cloud products. 
He had previously warned that he expected the chip shortage to run into the second half of 2022.
Liu said on Wednesday that Foxconn expected limited impact from the war in Ukraine, echoing Taiwan's government which says any impact on the island's supply chains would be small because Russia and Ukraine are not the main import sources of raw materials such as nickel and neon. 
Apple has paused all product sales in Russia in response to the invasion, which Russia calls a special military operation.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said it expected revenue for the first quarter as well as the year to range between a 3% fall and a 3% rise. Analysts expected revenue this year to rise 1.2%. 
The company forecast smartphone revenue to be flat in 2022.
EV PLAN
Foxconn has in recent months announced plans to become a major player in the global electric vehicle (EV) market. On Wednesday, it said it doesn't expect revenue from EVs to be significant until 2023.
Foxconn, which has EVs deals with a variety of companies including Lordstown Motors Corp, forecast an annual production of up to 750,000 units by 2025.
In the fourth quarter ended December, Foxconn's revenue fell 6%, its first decline in five quarters, though still the second-highest for the quarter.
Revenue from its key smart consumer and electronics products business fell between 3% to 15%, in the period. Smartphones account for 60% of this business.
Revenue from its cloud and networking products as well as computing products was flat. Components revenue rose more than 15%.
Foxconn shares closed 0.5% higher ahead of the earnings release, versus a 0.1% gain in the broader market. They have fallen 2.4% so far this year.

Net profit fell 3.4% to T$44.4 billion ($1.55 billion) in the October-December period. That compared with the T$43.32 billion average of 10 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz AG won't cut spending on future electric vehicles even as it copes with supply-chain cost pressures exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the German automaker's chief executive said on Tuesday.
Ola Kaellenius, speaking during the company's opening of its first U.S. electric vehicle (EV) battery factory, also affirmed the company's 2022 financial outlook remained in place despite the conflict.
""We always protect the investment into future technology and future products,"" Kaellenius told Reuters. ""That is the seed which we will harvest. Not even in COVID year of 2020 did we cut back on R&D for crucial projects."" 
Mercedes is working with suppliers in Ukraine whose operations have been disrupted, he added, but it was ""too early to tell what the wider ramifications will be."" 
Rocketing gasoline prices since Russia's invasion of Ukraine has amplified the challenges for established automakers that still rely on fossil fuel-powered vehicles for profits. And soaring prices for materials used in EV batteries like nickel, heavily mined in Russia, have also hurt the industry.
Kaellenius is trying to accelerate the shift by Mercedes from combustion technology company to a firm whose products do not emit carbon and rely on software and computing power.
Mercedes and other established automakers trail Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) in EV sales and in developing computer and software systems to compete with the U.S. firm's stream of new features and updates.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) Truck split from Mercedes in December and Kaellenius said Tuesday he saw no reason for Mercedes to further separate EVs from the combustion-engine operations. Some investors have pushed established automakers to create pure EV units. 
“There is only one Mercedes-Benz and that one company sooner than many people think will be an all-electric company,” Kaellenius said in an interview. 
Mercedes also said on Tuesday that Japanese battery maker Envision AESC would supply battery modules for U.S.-made Mercedes EVs from a new U.S. plant by the middle of the decade.
Alongside the launch of its Bibb County, Alabama, battery plant, Mercedes also previewed a large electric SUV to be built at the nearby Tuscaloosa, Alabama, assembly facility this year.
The EQS SUV and a smaller EQE electric SUV, also to be made in Alabama, join a growing lineup of electric SUVs seeking to challenge Tesla in the United States, China and Europe.
The battery plant, which will employ 600 workers, and the assembly facility are part of a 40 billion euro ($44 billion) drive by Mercedes to go all electric by 2030, where markets allow.
Mercedes, which plans to produce EV batteries in Europe, North America and Asia, aims to have eight cell factories with partners around the world with capacity to produce 200 gigawatt hours a year by the end of the decade.

The Mercedes Alabama assembly plant, which turns 25 this year, can build both electric and combustion vehicles, and is one of the largest Mercedes vehicle-making plants in the world.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky had said on Tuesday that Russia had started to show a ""more constructive"" attitude in talks, and repeated his view that NATO membership - a key Russian bugbear - was out of reach for Ukraine.
Late on Tuesday, Ukrainian Presidential aide Mikhaylo Podolyak claimed that Ukrainian forces had started a counteroffensive in several regions. Unverified video footage on Wednesday claimed to show 15 Russian helicopters destroyed or damaged at an airbase outside Kherson.
Away from the battlefield, the day is likely to be dominated by the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting and Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference. A first rate rise in nearly four years is considered all but certain, leaving Powell's guidance as the key variable.  U.S. retail sales data for February are likely to dominate early trading ahead of the Fed.
Elsewhere, investors will be nervously looking at the Russian bond market on a day when it has some big dollar and euro interest payments due. In response to Western sanctions, the Kremlin has enacted legislation to allow it to service foreign debt in rubles, something that will probably be viewed as a default by ratings agencies and bondholders. The ruble nonetheless strengthened nearly 2% in a nod to the ongoing peace talks. 
Technology stocks stood out in early trading, following their Chinese counterparts higher. All eyes were on Prosus (AS:PRX), the Dutch-listed vehicle that holds Naspers' stake in Internet giant Tencent. The start of trading in the stock was delayed due to problems establishing a price. 
BMW (DE:BMWG) stock rose 1.6%, the positive backdrop outweighing a profit warning from the carmaker due to the Ukrainian war. Like Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), BMW is having production problems due to its reliance on wire harnesses that are made in Ukraine.
In the U.K., spread betting specialist IG Group (LON:IGG) stock fell 3.3% after its fiscal third-quarter numbers suffered from a comparison with last year's meme stock craze. 
In foreign exchange markets, the euro was up 0.4% against the dollar at $1.0994, while sterling was up 0.1% at $1.3056. The dollar index was down 0.4% at 98.665. 
Crude oil prices bounced after their sharp losses on Tuesday which were validated by a 3.75 million barrel increase in U.S. crude stocks. Brent futures were back above $100 with a 3% rise to $103.03 a barrel, while U.S. crude was up 2.4% at $98.73 a barrel.

Under the airline's restructuring proposal, it would pay just 0.5% of debt owed and end its existing contracts. It was approved by its creditors and the High Court of Malaya last year.
The restructuring was proposed to avoid liquidation after the long-haul low-cost airline posted a record quarterly loss last September. It is one of many carriers in the Asia-Pacific region to have entered a court-overseen debt restructuring process to survive the pandemic.
""Cargo has been a strong lifeline for AAX and our recovery is already underway as a combination carrier with equal emphasis on cargo and passenger revenues, "" CEO Benyamin Ismail said.
""In the next two months we will recommence passenger services to several more international destinations in line with borders reopening.""

The completion of the debt restructuring will now pave the way for the proposed 500 million ringgit fund raising, the company said.

893,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 02:53AM ET</span>",Pfizer-BioNTech seek U.S. OK for second COVID booster for 65 and older,"(Reuters) -Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) on Tuesday filed an application with U.S. regulators seeking emergency use authorization for a second booster shot of their COVID-19 vaccine for people aged 65 and older.
The submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration includes data collected in Israel, where a second booster is authorized for many people over age 18.
An analysis of data from over a million adults 60 years and older showed rates of confirmed infections and severe illness were lower among individuals who received an additional booster dose of the vaccine administered at least four months after an initial booster (third) dose compared to those who received only one booster dose, the companies said.
The news was first reported by the Washington Post https://wapo.st/3i7nJwO earlier on Tuesday.
U.S. health officials including top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci have raised the prospects of a fourth shot many times, suggesting one might be needed for older people and to prepare for the possibility of another surge of cases.
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data has shown that vaccine efficacy wanes over time and that third shots help restore that efficacy, but it has not released comprehensive data based on age or health status.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Chief Executive Albert Bourla has several times in the past week told reporters that a fourth dose of the vaccine will be needed to offset waning protection gained with the third shot.
He told the Washington Post last week that data suggests a fourth dose dramatically improves protection against the dominant Omicron variant of the virus compared to the third dose after three-to-six months. 
The data Israel previously released was mixed.
Israel in late January said a fourth dose doubled protection against infection and increased protection against severe disease by 3 to 5 times compared to those who had received three shots, based on health ministry data. 
That analysis was more favorable than a small study of Israeli healthcare workers. When given at least four months after the third shot, a fourth dose was 30% effective against infection for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 11% for the  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccine.
""The elderly and immunocompromised are the groups that would benefit the most from additional boost,"" said Dan Barouch, a Harvard vaccine researcher. ""I think the data is supportive, but the benefits appear to be relatively small.""
Pfizer is looking at how a fourth dose performs in its own study of about 600 people. It and Moderna are betting additional booster doses will be needed for new virus variants that emerge.
While COVID cases are in retreat in the United State and much of the world, infections are rising in China as the Omicron variant spreads. In the UK and Europe, there has been a reversal in the downward trend of COVID cases as economies have opened up and a second version of Omicron circulates.

Pfizer last month said eventual 2022 sales of its COVID-19 vaccine may not top its current forecast of $32 billion, a 13% decline from 2021 levels.
Separately, the FDA plans to convene its expert advisory panel in early April to consider whether there should be an October or November campaign to encourage some or all adults to get additional boosters, and whether the shots should be the same as current vaccines or be retooled to counter new variants, the Washington Post reported, citing a federal official.

The price increases will take effect from Wednesday, it said late on Tuesday, adding that customers who had paid deposits on vehicles prior to then would not be affected.
""Due to the impact of continued rises in raw material prices, BYD has officially guided Wang Chao Business and Ocean Network Business to adjust prices on relevant EV models,"" it said in a statement on its official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account, referring to its sales channels. 
The announcement comes a day after Tesla raised its prices in China and the United States for the second time in less than a week. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has also said the U.S. electric carmaker was facing significant inflationary pressure in raw materials and logistics.
BYD also raised prices by 1,000-7,000 yuan on Feb. 1, citing the rising cost of raw materials and the cutting of government subsidies for new-energy vehicles (NEVs).
China has been promoting NEVs to help curb air pollution but believes the industry has matured enough to be driven by demand rather than subsidies, and in January slashed subsidies by 30%. 
The cost of raw materials is surging, exacerbated by supply chain disruption following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".

In particular, prices of metals used in cars have soared, including aluminium that is used in the bodywork, palladium used in catalytic converters, and nickel and lithium that power EV batteries.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The cost of insuring against a default in SoftBank Group Corp's debt hit a two-year high on Wednesday and its bond yield also climbed as sharp drops in the value of its tech investments have unnerved investors.
The value of marquee companies in the tech investor's portfolio have tumbled, hit by China's crackdown on tech companies, the prospect of higher interest rates and war in Ukraine. Among them,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Didi Global Inc have slid 35% and 64% respectively for the year to date.
""Debt investors are generally more conservative than equity investors, but if they're worried then equity investors probably should take notice,"" said Redex Research analyst Kirk Boodry. 
SoftBank's 5-year credit default swaps rose by around 25 basis points, data from IHS Markit showed. The yield on its unsecured eurobond maturing in 2025 closed at 6.767% on Tuesday, the highest in almost two years. That compares with around 3.1% at the end of last year. 
SoftBank shares are trading at two-year lows and were mostly flat on Wednesday morning.
CEO Masayoshi Son said last month ""we will definitely be selling a good chunk of assets"" as he pivoted after the collapse of the sale of Arm to a plan to list the chip designer in the United States. 
SoftBank sold $1 billion worth of Coupang shares last week at a price per share 30% below that of a similar sale in September.
Some analysts have questioned SoftBank's ability to sell down its portfolio in choppy markets, given that many investors have turned sceptical on money-losing companies that lack a clear path to profitability.
""The lack of profitability means there is no clear floor for share prices,"" Mio Kato at LightStream Research wrote on Smartkarma, adding the Japanese company could face the risk of margin calls.
""We are thus unconvinced about their ability to monetise holdings in any significant manner,"" he wrote.
SoftBank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Clearing by investors exposed to Russian and Chinese bonds could have contributed to SoftBank's rising yields with the conglomerate seen as a riskier investment than other tech firms, said Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners.
Analysts point to potential deterioration of SoftBank's loan-to-value ratio which rose to 22% at December-end from 19% three months earlier. SoftBank has pledged to keep the ratio below 25% in normal times with a 35% threshold in abnormal periods. 

""We believe the environment may be classified as a crisis... which allows SBG to use the 35% threshold instead,"" Trung Nguyen, a senior credit analyst at Lucror Analytics, wrote on Smartkarma.
In the early days of the pandemic, SoftBank's share price collapsed to below 4,000 yen as valuations slid, triggering a record buyback funded by asset sales. They were trading at 4,256 yen on Wednesday.

896,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2022 01:21AM ET</span>",Barclays' VXX price jump drives double-digit gains for volatility arbitrage fund,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Days before Thanksgiving, Kris Sidial, a co-founder at volatility arbitrage fund The Ambrus Group, told investors the firm was betting that extreme price moves in some volatility-tracking exchange traded notes were likely to get worse.
The firm bought deep out-of-the-money call options on the iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN - relatively inexpensive contracts that had a low chance of making money but stood to explode in value if the share price were to soar.
This week, VXX shares jumped as much as 60% over the course of two trading days.
The firm, which has an estimated $35 million to $55 million under management, is yet to close out its VXX positions, Sidial said. He declined to give details of the trade but said, at the peak of VXX's rise, the firm's percentage gains were in the double digits month-to-date.
VXX shares soared for a second day on Tuesday, a day after British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it had suspended the sales and issuance of the shares due to capacity constraints. 
Sidial believed Cboe Options Exchange's decision in November to extend trading hours on S&P 500 and Cboe Volatility Index options to nearly 24 hours each business day had the potential to spur bigger price swings for some ETNs that seek to track volatility. 
""Call buyers of derivatives on these exchange traded products may get very lucky,"" he wrote to investors in a Nov. 22 letter seen by Reuters. 
Global financial markets have seen a sharp rise in volatility, with big price swings in stocks and commodities, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict spooks investors and the U.S. Federal Reserve gets set to raise interest rates for the first time in three years.
Analysts expect VXX shares to still see wild price swings as the ETN's trading price strays far from its indicative price - where it should be trading based on the value of its underlying securities. 
Typically, large banks buy and sell shares to generally keep the trading price of the ETNs in line with their indicative value. 
But with the suspension of new shares that process can go awry. On Tuesday, VXX traded as much as $14 higher than its indicative price. The shares finished about flat at $28.70 and is up 9% for the week.
""This is essentially scarcity value, i.e. demand for VXX shares that would otherwise have been met with share creation,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializes in volatility trading. 
Thompson's firm, which had ""some exposure"" to VXX sold all of it on Tuesday, he said. 
""We don't want to be around when/if they start issuing shares again,"" he said.
Some investors said the recent wild moves in VXX revives memories of another volatility-tracking product - VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN, which collapsed nearly 60% over the course of four trading sessions in March 2012, after the ETN's issuer,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), reopened issuance of shares after a one-month suspension. 
Investors who held a bearish view on VXX, meanwhile, are facing sharp losses after the ETN's surge.
LONG TIME COMING? 
Sidial and some others have long worried about the possibility of price dislocations in ETNs, where much of the price stability of these products depends on the ability of authorized participants' (APs) - typically large banks - to buy and sell shares efficiently. 
Even when share issuance has not been suspended, however, APs have occasionally struggled to keep the price stable, as liquidity dries up during episodes of market stress.
Sidial said the ability to make trades at nearly any hour of the day has the potential to exacerbate volatility by allowing market participants to react immediately to potentially negative news, often worsening market liquidity during market shocks.

The Cboe has in the past said the ability to trade S&P 500 and VIX options nearly around the clock would help investors manage risk more efficiently. 
""This is something we have been tracking for quite some time,"" Sidial said.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly up on Wednesday morning, with Chinese shares easing a selloff. However, market volatility remains due to the conflict in Ukraine and investors await the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.67% by 10:34 PM ET (2:34 AM GMT). Wednesday’s trade data showed that exports grew 19.1% year-on-year and imports grew 34% year-on-year in February 2022. The trade balance was –JPY668.3 billion ($5.65 billion), while the adjusted trade balance was –JPY1.03 trillion.
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.75% and in Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.88%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 2.51%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.43% while the Shenzhen Component was up 0.34%. Chinese shares listed in the U.S. also began to slowly climb out from a recent selloff, although fears of a regulatory crackdown and China’s ties to Russia sparking a U.S. backlash continue to weigh on Chinese stocks.
The Fed will hand down its policy decision later in the day, where it is widely expected to hike interest rates. However, further hikes are less certain as the growth risks from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 remain.
“The confluence of events leading into this meeting puts policymakers in a very unenviable position,” Nomura Securities International Inc. executive director Matt Rowe told Bloomberg.
“It’s being publicly debated whether if you create a recession to push the number down to 2%, is that actually a policy error?” he added, in reference to inflation.
The Bank of England will hand down its policy decision on Thursday, with the Bank of Japan following a day later. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel, Governing Council member Ignazio Visco, and Chief Economist Philip Lane will speak at a conference on Thursday.
Ukraine and Russia will resume talks to end the conflict between the two countries later in the day. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, tweeted that the negotiations are “difficult” but there is room for compromise. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine’s leadership of not being “serious” about resolving the conflict.
Western sanctions against Russia also remain a risk, with the country highly likely to default as Russian decrees will likely prevent dollar settlements. But Russia also began paying $117 million in interest on dollar bonds.
Meanwhile, Tuesday’s U.S. producer price inflation (PPI) grew 10% year-on-year, and grew 0.8% month-on-month, in February. The core PPI grew 8.4% year-on-year and 0.2% month-on-month. The NY Empire State Manufacturing Index for March was -11.80.
The data compounds the Fed’s dilemma, according to some investors.
“We will be closely watching the Fed’s dot plot, which we expect to signal five or six interest-rate hikes this year, more than December’s projections but in line with market expectations,” New York Life Investments portfolio strategist Lauren Goodwin said in a note.
“A dot plot projecting more hiking would likely be a hawkish signal and could result in an earlier yield curve inversion.”"
898,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 09:56PM ET</span>",Movie theater operator AMC invests in troubled miner Hycroft,"By Mike Spector and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -Movie-theater chain AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) Holdings Inc said on Tuesday it agreed to buy a large stake in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp for $27.9 million, capitalizing on its popularity with retail investors to provide a financial lifeline to the troubled gold and silver mine operator.
Hycroft, which owns a mine in Northern Nevada, was on the verge of bankruptcy before AMC's investment. Now, it plans to raise up to $500 million by selling shares in the open market over time, Hycroft said on Tuesday. Such a large capital raise is not typically accessible to a small company in dire financial straits.
Yet the fascination of retail investors with so-called meme stocks have made such deals possible. AMC Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron on Tuesday said the company raised a $1.8 billion ""war chest"" in 2021 thanks to stock sales snapped up by retail investors. 
Hycroft said on Tuesday it had also attracted ""atypical retail investor interest"" but warned investors that buying its stock could result in losing all or a substantial portion of their money.
Hycroft shares ended trading up 9.35% at $1.52 after almost doubling in value earlier in the day on news of the deal. AMC shares closed up nearly 6.9% at $14.48
Aron said Hycroft resembled the movie-theater chain a year ago, facing a liquidity crisis despite ""rock-solid assets.""
Still, AMC's investment ""is a little baffling"" and its cash would be better used on repaying debt that exceeded $5 billion at the end of December, said Alicia Reese, a Wedbush Securities analyst.
AMC and longtime precious-metals investor Eric Sprott will each invest $27.9 million and receive separate 22% stakes in Hycroft, the companies said. They will also receive an equal amount of shares in warrants exercisable at a price of $1.07 per share.
Mudrick Capital, a Hycroft creditor whose special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal with Hycroft in 2020 made it the company's largest shareholder with a 40% stake, helped put together the deal with AMC, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Jason Mudrick, the firm's founder and chief investment officer, called Aron last week asking him to advise Hycroft on how it could launch a stock market offering to stave off bankruptcy, the person familiar with the matter said. 
Hycroft, previously known as Allied Nevada, had filed for bankruptcy before and emerged from it in 2015. More recently, its stock rose after attracting interest from retail investors on social-media platform Reddit. 
Mudrick knew Aron because he had previously invested in AMC and participated in a debt restructuring deal in 2020 that helped keep the movie theater operator afloat.
Aron responded that he was interested investing in Hycroft to diversify AMC's business, and that such a deal could help Hycroft attract more investor interest, the source said.
WHIRLWIND TOUR 
Mudrick chartered a plane on Sunday to fly AMC executives and directors to Nevada for a whirlwind tour of Hycroft's mining operations in the town of Winnemucca the next morning, the source said. 
The deal closed just before 4 p.m. EDT Monday, the source said. Before the negotiations, the company's cash had dwindled to roughly $8 million, the source added.

AMC had no immediate comment on Mudrick's work on the deal, while Hycroft did not respond to a request for comment. 
Sprott and other creditors agreed to push back Hycroft's debt repayments to 2027. The boost in Hycroft's finances may allow it to develop an expensive mill to unearth gold and silver.

Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. and GDS Holdings (NASDAQ:GDS) Ltd. were the best performers, gaining around 15% each. The move tracks an advance overnight in its U.S.-listed counterparts. 
Investors are weighing cheap valuations following the historic rout against poor sentiment in the sector as regulatory risks linger, including a possible U.S. delisting of Chinese firms. Concerns related to Beijing’s ties with Russia and a lockdown in China’s tech hub Shenzhen are also adding to worries.

New York (Reuters) -The three main Wall Street stock indexes rallied on Tuesday, a day before an expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve, while oil prices dropped 7% on hopes of an end to the conflict in Ukraine.
Investors are expecting the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates for the first time in three years by at least 25 basis points amid surging prices. Traders will also be closely watching the Fed for details on how it plans to end its bond-buying program.
Ahead of the Fed's meeting on Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year note yields eased from more than two-year highs and were last at 2.1544%, after earlier rising to 2.169%, the highest since June 2019.
""I think the big event this week is going to be Fed discussing what they're going to do with the portfolio and how fast they're going to move. The expectation in the short term of course is going to be the raising of the rates by a quarter of a percent,"" said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager at Plumb Balanced Fund in Wisconsin.
On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500, which had slumped about 2.4% in the prior three sessions, rallied, driven by technology, consumer discretionary and healthcare sectors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.82% to 33,544.34, the S&P 500 gained 2.14% to 4,262.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.92% to 12,948.62.
""What you're seeing is relief rallies on a bear market. There's hopes and expectations that something will start resolving in Ukraine,"" Plumb added. 
European stocks, which had been rebounding in recent sessions, dipped after China reported a jump in coronavirus cases and new restrictions. The ongoing war in Ukraine also weighed on European shares despite continuing ceasefire talks and some positive signs of a breakthrough.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.28% and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.94%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had closed 2.73% lower overnight.
Oil prices tumbled more than 6% to their lowest in almost three weeks on Tuesday as supply disruption fears eased on Ukraine peace hopes and surging COVID-19 cases in China spurred demand concerns.

901,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 07:42PM ET</span>",Buttressing Greenland - a bailout in China's distressed property sector,"By Engen Tham and Xie Yu
SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Greenland Holdings Corp Ltd, a major Shanghai-based Chinese state-backed property developer responsible for marquee projects at home and abroad, was scrambling for funds late last year, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
In danger of defaulting on a $500 million offshore bond in December, it was rescued after Shanghai authorities told local state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to step in and buy new Greenland debt, sources told Reuters.
Greenland's financial straits and subsequent bailout, details of which are previously unreported, mark the first known example where Chinese SOEs have been directly ordered to participate in a property sector bond offering - highlighting more active and targeted action being taken by authorities as they seek to limit risks posed by the industry.
Here is what happened.
Greenland, China's No. 7 property developer and highly leveraged, became swept up in a sector-wide debt crisis that roiled international markets last year amid fears that a large-scale developer collapse could derail the world's second-largest economy.
Like many of its peers, it was reeling from tighter caps on debt ratios introduced in January 2021 that resulted in a liquidity squeeze across the sector.
By October, some long-term lenders such as CITIC Bank were reducing their lending, two people with direct knowledge of Greenland's financial situation said, adding the state of affairs was not helped by downgrades to its debt ratings from credit rating agencies. 
It had sought fresh financing from trust firms and leasing companies but a sharp rise in interest rates was proving to be a stumbling block, they said.
In the fourth quarter, Greenland embarked on more drastic steps - slashing real estate-related headcount by 30% and placing more strategic emphasis on infrastructure construction projects that accounted for half of its revenues, they added.
Even so, it did not have sufficient funds to cover the likely event that many holders of the $500 million puttable bond would seek to exercise their right to redeem it roughly a year early on Dec. 16, they said.
Sources for this article were not authorised to speak to media and spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Greenland said in a statement to Reuters it has always repaid its domestic and overseas debts in full and kept financing costs low, adding that its liabilities reduction plan was progressing smoothly. CITIC Bank did not respond to requests for comment.
WHITE KNIGHTS
Concerned about Greenland's financial situation, Shanghai municipal authorities had sometime during the fourth quarter asked its lenders to be flexible with repayment extensions and to maintain rather than drop existing relationships, said one person with knowledge of the matter.
Then in early December, the Shanghai government's state asset administrator held a meeting with representatives of seven SOEs, ordering them to buy new dollar bonds issued by Greenland, according to four people briefed about the gathering.
Shanghai Municipal Investment Group, Bank of Shanghai, Shanghai Land (Group) Co and Lujiazui International Trust Co were among the SOEs, said two of the four sources.
On Dec. 14, Greenland announced it had raised $350 million in a dollar bond issue. Due August 2022 and carrying a 7.974% coupon, it was a rare developer bond deal at a time when concerns about the sector had dried up new note issuance. The only purchasers were the seven SOES, two sources said.
Three days later, Greenland said it had redeemed 85.9% of the $500 million bond after put options were exercised. 
The Shanghai government's state asset administrator, the Shanghai municipal government and the four SOEs named above did not respond to requests for comment.
China's property sector crisis has posed a high-stakes quandary for President Xi Jinping, who is seeking to secure an unprecedented third term this year. 
On one hand, the government wants to impose financial discipline on an industry known for unbridled borrowing and which by some metrics accounts for a quarter of China's economy. But it also can't afford to derail growth or fuel social unrest. 
Bond defaults by China Evergrande Group, the world's most indebted developer with some $300 billion in liabilities, as well as by other developers, have seen authorities soften their initial stance that market forces would hold sway.
Rules relating to M&A and capital raising in the sector have been relaxed and developers have been given easier access to pre-sale funds held in escrow accounts. At last week's annual meeting of parliament, Premier Li Keqiang signalled more easing was in the works.
Local authorities have also encouraged SOEs to purchase developer assets, sources have previously said, although it is unclear if any SOEs have been ordered per se into an acquisition. 
SHIMAO TOO 
Shimao Group Holdings, a developer which has put all its property up for sale to repay debt, has also had a helping hand from Shanghai municipal authorities. 
Twenty-seven of Shimao's creditors were asked to maintain lending positions and to not publicly undermine Shimao's creditworthiness, said a separate person who attended a creditor meeting. ""Everyone was stony-faced, no one had any reaction,"" said the person.
Shimao did not respond to requests for comment. 
Greenland, however, appears to have had more government intervention than most other developers. The sources who spoke with Reuters were not sure why but noted Greenland is state-backed and has high-profile projects.
It recently built Sydney's tallest residential tower and has billions of dollars worth of projects in London, New York, Los Angeles and Paris. At home, its projects include construction of the tallest building in northwest China and it is heavily involved in building subways, highways and bridges.
The use of government-backed credit support rather than the purchase of fire-sale assets is becoming the preferred policy option for reducing risk in the sector, one government policy advisor told Reuters.
There is also a growing consensus that when deciding which firms will gain government support, it will be size rather than whether a firm is government-backed or private that will be the key factor, the person said, adding the bottom line is to prevent a financial crisis.
Just how far the government will support Greenland remains to be seen. Its financial difficulties are not over. It has $190 billion in total liabilities, and according to Refinitiv data, outstanding bonds worth $7.1 billion, of which $3.7 billion is due to mature this year.
The order to SOEs to support Greenland only pertained to the $350 million purchase of new debt, the sources said.

At one SOE at least, there is fear that Greenland might fall further into financial strife and of the potential fallout if that happens.
The written instructions with a Shanghai SASAC letterhead that ordered the purchase of Greenland's bonds are being kept in a safe place in case Greenland defaults and SOE officials are called to account for their actions, said one person with knowledge of the matter.

902,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 07:36PM ET</span>",Wall Street jumps as S&P snaps 3-day slump; Fed on tap,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Tuesday and the S&P 500 ended a 3-day skid as another drop in oil prices and a softer-than-expected reading on producer prices helped ease inflation fears among investors, with the focus turning to the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy announcement.
Brent crude settled below $100 a barrel after rocketing higher to more than $139 last week, providing some temporary relief for equity investors that have seen stocks come under pressure this year from surging inflation concerns, uncertainty over the Fed's policy path to tame rising prices and more recently, escalating conflict in Ukraine.
U.S. producer prices increased solidly in February as the cost of goods like gasoline surged, and further gains are in the pipeline following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has made crude oil and other commodities more expensive.
Still, the data for the 12 months through February matched expectations predicting a 10% increase in producer prices, while the producer price index for final demand on a monthly basis increased 0.8%, just shy of the 0.9% estimate and lower than the 1.2% increase registered in January.
The market is now fully pricing in a rate hike of at least 25 basis points when the central bank makes its policy statement on Wednesday. Investors will also be closely watching the Fed's projections for the path of rate hikes this year and in coming years to rein in inflation.[IRPR] 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has recently floated multiple rate hikes this year as the Fed seeks to curb inflation. 
""The fact is (PPI) was weaker than the expectation so therefore the idea that Jay Powell is right going 25 basis points seems to be the way the market feels today, that could change tomorrow,"" said Ken Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors in Boca Raton, Florida. 
""The market is in a very oversold position, there are still going to be bumpy roads ahead but today could just be one of those snap-back rallies like we saw last week.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 599.1 points, or 1.82%, to 33,544.34, the S&P 500 gained 89.34 points, or 2.14%, to 4,262.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 367.40 points, or 2.92%, to 12,948.62.
The S&P 500 slumped about 2.4% in the prior three sessions and recently joined the Dow, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 in forming a ""death cross"" technical pattern, when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average, which some investors believe signals more near-term weakness is likely.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors advanced, with technology and consumer discretionary stocks leading the way while energy, the sole positive sector on the year, slumped nearly 4% on the day along with crude prices. 
Megacap growth stocks gained with  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) up 3.87% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) up 2.97%, providing the biggest boosts to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq.
Meanwhile, investors also closely tracked a steep jump in daily COVID-19 infections in China for the possibility of denting global economic growth, and progress in Ukraine-Russia talks to end their weeks-long conflict.
In the latest hint at compromise, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv was prepared to accept security guarantees that stop short of its long-term objective of the NATO alliance membership, which Moscow opposes.
Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) gained 8.70% and United Airlines jumped 9.19% after the U.S. carriers raised their current-quarter revenue forecasts, even as they trimmed capacity. The Arca Airline index climbed 5.57%.
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 13.46 billion shares, compared with the 13.78 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days. 

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.07-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.72-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 21 new highs and 386 new lows.

Shares in Grupo Aeromexico, which operates the country's main airline and filed for bankruptcy in 2020, fell 27% to 59 cents and have lost about half their value in the past four days.
Analysts have said trading in the shares has not reflected a creditor deal that was approved in January.
""We attribute the movements of the last few months to mere speculation, since it was known that the value of the shares would be practically zero,"" said Brian Rodriguez, a stock market analyst at Monex financial group.
Through the tender offer, which took place between Feb. 15 and March 14, investment vehicle Alinfra purchased 133.2 million shares of the airline at a price of one cent each.
A subsequent share exchange will dilute the company's current capital stock to less than 0.01% of its capital after the restructure.
Aeromexico declared bankruptcy in June 2020 amid a slump in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Its shares were trading at around 15 pesos each in January 2020.

The lawmakers cited the company's previous violation of an agreement with the Justice Department that allowed the controversial merger of Ticketmaster and Live Nation in 2010. That was settled with Live Nation agreeing to refrain from retaliating against venues that do not use its Ticketmaster service for every event.
The lawmakers asked the department to assess Live Nation's compliance with the updated consent decree.
""As live events continue to open up, American consumers are confronting skyrocketing ticket prices, opaque terms, and exorbitant fees. Yet live entertainment markets, especially ticket markets, are dominated by one corporation, Live Nation, which cemented its dominance through its 2010 merger with Ticketmaster,"" they wrote to Jonathan Kanter, head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division.

The letter noted with dismay that Live Nation had an ""aggressive acquisition strategy"" that included its purchase of Rival, a ticketing startup designed to compete with Ticketmaster.
""We are deeply concerned that the Department’s past enforcement and negotiated remedies in this industry have failed to adequately foster and protect competition in live entertainment and ticketing markets,"" they wrote.

U.S. drugmaker Lilly said it will send medicines for urgent medical conditions such as cancer and diabetes. It is suspending sales of what it called ""non-essential medicines"" as well as all investments and promotions. It also will not start any new clinical trials there.
Swiss drugmaker Novartis also said it would stop investments, marketing activities there and all scientific events organized by the company or external parties in Russia.
U.S. drugmaker AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), which owns blockbuster wrinkle treatment Botox, said it has temporarily suspended operations for all its aesthetics products in the country. 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Inc said it was stopping enrollment in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus as well as any openings of new sites, but was committed to providing essential health products. 
On Monday,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), Germany's Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) and  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) had pulled back from non-essential spending in the country. Pfizer and Bayer said they would maintain a supply of medicines to Russia.
Western companies have come under pressure to leave Russia, but the healthcare sector has not pulled out because medicine and medical devices and equipment are considered necessary for humanitarian reasons and are excluded from sanctions.
""While it is good to see large corporations, including in the pharmaceutical space, take a proactive stand against war and aggression, any step to suspend medical supplies, even for non-essential items, could end up putting the health of patients in Russia at risk,"" said Anant Bhan, a global health and bioethics researcher.
Getting supplies in has already become tougher. Sanctions have cut off Russian banks from the international financial system, while shipping companies have halted services to the country, interrupting delivery of medical supplies.

In a post titled ""Lilly and Lilly Foundation Provide support for People in Ukraine"" on its website, Lilly said any profit from continued sales in Russia will be donated to organizations dedicated to humanitarian relief.
Lilly is the first to exclude drugs it designates as ""non-essential"". The company told Reuters in an email that an example of a non-essential medicine was Cialis, a branded erectile dysfunction treatment available from other sellers as a generic drug. It did not disclose specific treatments affected by the decision.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Tuesday, as investors piled into to beaten tech sectors ahead of the Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday.
The S&P 500 rose 2.1%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.8%, or 599 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.9%.
Tech found its footing, climbing more than 3% as the recent weakness in big tech and chip stocks appeared to entice dip-buying action.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) led the gains in big tech, with both up more than 2% and 3% respectively, while NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also racked up gains.
Also helping tech, Treasury yields took a breather somewhat from their recent melt-up just as the Fed kicked off its two-day meeting.
With the odds of the 25-basis point nearly fully priced in, investor attention will be focused on the Fed’s summary of economic projections to gauge the shift in interest rate expectations for this year.  
Commentary on how committed the Fed is on tackling inflation will also be closely watched. If the central bank indicates that it favors a wait and see approach that could stoke worries about whether the Fed is able to get inflation under control at time when concerns about a recession ahead continue to increase. 
“I think the market will be disappointed if the Fed strikes a tone that we're going to raise rates by 25 basis points and then see how things go,” Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager at FolioBeyond said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday.
Sentiment on the broader market was also helped by easing concerns that higher for longer oil prices would dent global growth as WTI fell further below $100 a barrel.
 Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO),  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) were among the biggest decliners in the energy sector, which was the only sector in the red.
The fall in oil prices wasn’t stemmed by signs that an imminent diplomatic solution to end war appears to be some ways off after Russian President Vladimir V. Putin reportedly said that “Kyiv is not demonstrating a serious attitude towards finding mutually acceptable solutions.”
Industrials, meanwhile, were pushed higher by the airline stocks after Southwest, United Airline and Delta reported stronger than expected bookings and signaled a quicker than expected recovery in travel demand.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were up more than 9%, while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) was up more than 8%. 
In other news, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) increased nearly 5% after it teamed up with Volvo Cars to explore the potential of installing electric vehicle chargers throughout its stores nationwide.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Wintershall Dea AG said on Tuesday Russian oligarch German Khan, who was sanctioned by the European Union, was stepping down from its board, causing further upheaval at the German oil company with several ties to Russia.
Wintershall Dea said its business activities would be unaffected by the move but it was examining whether LetterOne's shareholding would be affected. 
The oil and gas producer is a joint venture of German chemicals giant BASF and LetterOne, the holding company controlled by Russian oligarch Mikail Fridman, who is also linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin and who was sanctioned by the EU last month. 
""No confidential information regarding Supervisory Board topics will be shared with German Khan any longer,"" Wintershall Dea said in a statement.
Khan, alongside Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich, was among a new list of business leaders whose assets were frozen by the EU for supporting the Russian state.
That was part of new sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine, including bans on Russian energy sector investments, luxury goods exports to Moscow and imports of steel products from Russia.
Khan was also among three LetterOne shareholders who last week quit as directors from the London-based investment group they co-founded with oligarch Mikhail Fridman as it tries to distance itself from Russia.
Earlier on Tuesday, Khan also resigned from private Russian lender Alfa-Bank, which he co-owns.
""With regard to the most recent inclusion of German Khan to EU and UK sanctions lists, it is being examined whether this has further consequences for LetterOne as shareholder of Wintershall Dea AG,"" the company added. ""As a matter of precaution, all payments to LetterOne will be stopped for the time being.""
BASF holds 67% of the voting rights in Wintershall Dea, or a total stake of 72.7% when non-voting preference shares are taken into account, with the remainder held by Letter One.
Announcing the sanctions, the EU described Khan as ""believed to be one of the most influential persons in Russia"" who, like Fridman, ""maintains a close relationship with Vladimir Putin and continues to trade significant favours with him.""

Wintershall Dea, which has had a large oil and gas exploitation business in Russia, was also a major financial backer of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which was blocked from going into operation by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz shortly before Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month.
Wintershall Dea, which has relied on Russia for nearly half of its oil and gas production, earlier this month stopped payments to Russia and wrote off its 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) financing in Nord Stream 2.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -EU antitrust regulators on Tuesday raided several automotive companies and associations in several countries on suspicion of breaching the bloc's cartel rules, while Britain's competition authority also launched a probe.
The European Commission also sent companies requests for information, it said without disclosing company names.
""The inspections and requests for information concern possible collusion in relation to the collection, treatment and recovery of end-of-life cars and vans which are considered waste,"" the EU competition enforcer said in a statement.
 Renault  (PA:RENA) said it ""confirms that it was visited today by European Commission investigators"" and that it was cooperating fully. 
Opel, a brand of world No. 4 carmaker Stellantis, said its offices had been searched by investigators.
""The subject of investigation is the area of recycling end-of-life vehicles,"" Opel said in a statement. ""Of course, we cooperate fully with the authorities."" 
German carmaker BMW said it had received a request for information and would respond.
Mercedes Benz said it did not expect to be fined because it had approached the EU regulator and Britain's Competition and Markets Authority with information as a ""leniency applicant.""
The CMA said it was investigating a number of unnamed automakers and some industry bodies in its own end-of-life vehicle probe, and that it was cooperating with the Commission.Ford said in a statement that it had been served with a notice by CMA ""relating to the recycling of old or written-off vehicles, specifically cars and vans, also known as end-of-life vehicles"".
""Given the situation is ongoing it would be inappropriate for us to say more at this stage except to state that we will fully cooperate with the CMA's review,"" the U.S. carmaker said.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and its premium brand Audi both declined to comment. A spokesman for Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) said the carmaker had not been raided by investigators.
Companies found breaching EU cartel rules face fines up to 10% of their global turnover.

The Commission has in the past decade issued fines totalling about 2.2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) against car parts cartels dealing in products ranging from brakes to wire harnesses, seat belts and air bags.

Investing.com – Stocks surged on Tuesday ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates as oil prices plunged for a second day this week.
The Fed is largely expected to raise rates a quarter point when it announces its latest policy moves tomorrow afternoon, followed by a press conference by Chair Jerome Powell, who may be able to shed more light on the Fed’s approach to rates given the turmoil caused by Russia’s war on Ukraine.
The central bank has to strike a delicate balance between fighting inflationary pressures and acting patiently so as not to trigger a slowdown, as soaring energy prices have put a damper on consumer sentiment.
Analysts will focus on the Fed’s projections for how far it will have to raise rates to tamp down inflation.
Reuters reported that data on Tuesday showed U.S. producer prices rose solidly in February, both for the year and month. 
Oil prices are in retreat, down another 6% on Tuesday amid a surge in Covid cases in China, which is locking down regions that include manufacturing centers. That threatens to curtail growth, driving the per-barrel price of crude back below $100.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is holding a meeting next week, calling on the leaders of member states such as President Joe Biden to convene over the escalating Ukraine situation. 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Airline stocks
U.S. airline stocks are in for a comeback after several carriers raised revenue forecasts on stronger demand and travel rebounds. Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and JetBlue Airways Corp (NASDAQ:JBLU) all rallied on Tuesday.
2. Oil continues to fall
Oil prices continued their tumble for a second straight day, with both U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent tumbling as much as 8% on Tuesday before pulling back some. The drop is even more precipitous — at more than 20% — when compared to the 14-year highs of above $130 a barrel attained by both benchmarks just over a week ago.
3. Fed statement
Of course it’s been well-telegraphed that the Federal Reserve is going to raise rates tomorrow, and likely by a quarter-point. That’s half the amount people were thinking just a few weeks ago, before Russia attacked Ukraine. But people will be listening for what the Fed has to say about the outlook now that war has broken out and the economic picture has gotten cloudier.

GM's premium brand already has received 233,000 expressions of interest from consumers, Rory Harvey, Cadillac's global vice president, said.
""We can't tell yet how many of those will translate into orders,"" Harvey told a media briefing. ""Typically, 10% of hard raisers turn into orders - we anticipate a higher order rate"" than usual.
GM told suppliers earlier this year to gear up for production of 25,000 Lyriqs in 2022, up from the previous 3,200 planned, sources told Reuters in February.
Harvey said GM brought forward the production launch of the Lyriq by nine months, reflecting higher-than-expected initial demand.
The Lyriq is the first of an all-new portfolio of electric vehicles that Cadillac plans to roll out by 2030.
The mid-size crossover goes into limited production March 21 in Spring Hill, Tennessee, with the first rear-wheel-drive models heading to dealers in late May, Cadillac sales boss Eric Cunningham said. 
Cadillac will formally open the Lyriq order bank on May 19 and will also take orders for the all-wheel-drive variant, which won't go into production until late 2022.

""We're still working through how many Lyriqs we can build this year and next,"" said Harvey, citing the supply of semiconductors and batteries as potential short-term constraints.
Cunningham said customers will be able to order the Lyriq online through the brand's new digital retail platform, then select a local dealer from which to take delivery.

STOCKHOLM/BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has picked Germany as the site for a huge new chipmaking complex, giving the first details of a $88 billion investment drive across Europe, which is striving to cut its reliance on imports and ease a supply crunch for manufacturers.
The plan is the latest big investment announcement by a major semiconductor maker as the industry tries to catch up with a boom in demand for chips used in everything from smartphones to cars, though there will be no quick fix as the new German plants won't come online until 2027.
The U.S. chipmaker is spreading its investments in Europe around half a dozen countries, including boosting its existing factory in Ireland, setting up a design and research facility in France, and a packaging and assembly site in Italy. 
The initial spending will total 33 billion euros ($36 billion), including 17 billion euros in Germany, where the auto industry is likely to be a prime customer for cutting-edge chips that could use technology as small as 2-nanometers.
German automaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) highlighted the pain caused by chip shortages on Tuesday, saying it sold 2 million fewer cars than planned last year due to the issue.
Intel's announcement comes after the European Commission last month set out plans to encourage chip manufacturing in the European Union, with proposed new legislation to ease state aid rules for chip factories and enable $17 billion in additional public and private investment. 
Chipmakers are looking to build more factories to make advanced chips for use in premium smartphones like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s latest iPhones that use chips with 5-nanometer technology. A nanometer is just several atoms wide.
Bernstein Research analyst Stacy Rasgon was confident Intel could manage the roll out of investments to match demand going forward, and was positive on expanding with government subsidies.
""(Intel) is using capacity as a strategic weapon ... Part of the strategy right now is to go around the world and beg for money,"" Rasgon said. ""If there's any time to run around the world begging for money to build semiconductor manufacturing facilities now is the time.""
BIG INCENTIVES
Germany has come out as the big winner by cornering the bulk of Intel's investment but CEO Pat Gelsinger declined to say the amount of state aid the company is getting from the country. 
Intel will build two factories in Magdeburg, Germany, creating 7,000 construction jobs, 3,000 permanent jobs at the company, and tens of thousands of additional jobs across suppliers and partners, it said.
Gelsinger said Intel wants to spend the remaining money from its planned 80 billion euro investment over the next 10 years to build out the complete Magdeburg site and further develop the sites in Italy and France.
The company will invest an additional 12 billion euros in an existing Irish facility which will take its total investment in Ireland to more than 30 billion euros.
It is also in talks with Italy for a chip assembly and packaging plant for a potential investment of up to 4.5 billion euros, expected to start operations between 2025 and 2027.
In France, Intel plans to build its new European research hub, creating 1,000 new high-tech jobs. 
The company will also increase its lab space in Poland and plans to establish joint labs with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center in Spain for advanced computing.
Gelsinger had announced plans in September to spend $88 billion in Europe over the next decade, and the choice of sites comes after some EU governments including Italy offered big incentives to try and woo the chipmaker to invest in their countries. 
Spreading its factories around different locations could help the company get more subsidies from different countries.
But Intel will have to negotiate with each European country where it's locating facilities for state aid, European Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton told journalists.

He also said the Commission was talking with other chipmakers and hoping to make similar announcements in the coming months, but did not provide details.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 03:21PM ET</span>","Delta, Virgin Atlantic CEOs say travel demand is robust","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) -Delta Air Lines Inc and partner Virgin Atlantic said on Tuesday that pent-up demand for international travel meant customers were willing to pay higher fares, spurring a rebound in bookings and helping them cover surging fuel costs. 
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced the closure of vast swathes of airspace and pushed the cost of fuel higher, applying new pressures to an airline industry that has spent two years battling travel bans and restrictions from COVID-19. 
CEO Ed Bastian told a news conference in London that Delta had enjoyed the busiest booking day in its history last week, even though many Asian routes remained suspended, and he was seeing the strongest demand in his career.
Virgin CEO Shai Weiss said that while he could not predict how consumers would respond to higher prices in the long term, for now it was seeing strong demand for premium leisure travel and a strong recovery in business travel. 
""We really haven't seen any impact at all, in terms of reluctance to travel from U.S. travellers coming to Europe,"" Delta's Bastian said, adding that he was not at ""a point of nervousness"" about rising oil prices.
As Bastian was speaking, Delta raised its current-quarter revenue forecast.
U.S. airlines, which cut capacity during the pandemic, do not hedge against volatile oil prices like most European airlines. The industry expects fares to rise as demand increases, helping to soften the blow. 
Weiss said Virgin had seen a bit of a dip in demand after the Russian invasion, but that it had since recovered.
""There is a very strong pricing environment right now, which makes sense given the pent-up demand but also of course the high input prices of fuel,"" he said. 

Both airlines also said they had seen a recovery in business class bookings, with Delta saying corporate travel was 60% back, led by demand in the United States, while Virgin's business bookings were at 50% of 2019 levels. 
Delta hold a 49% stake in Virgin Atlantic, while Richard Branson's Virgin Group holds 51%.

ROME (Reuters) - A leading Generali (MI:GASI) shareholder on Tuesday proposed naming the Italian insurer's head of Austria as its new chief executive, in a challenge to the reappointment of Philippe Donnet.
Generali's outgoing board has put forward Donnet for a third mandate as CEO ahead of a shareholder vote to elect a new board at the end of April.
Italian tycoons Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone and Leonardo Del Vecchio who are, respectively, Generali's second- and third-largest investors, are opposing the reappointment as they challenge the insurer's single largest investor, investment bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY).
Unveiling his own slate of nominees for the board, Caltagirone on Tuesday said in a statement he was proposing Luciano Cirina, Generali's current head of Austria and central and eastern Europe, for the position of chief executive.
""Under his leadership, that area has posted the stronger growth in recent years,"" Caltagirone said.
""Hailing from (Generali's hometown of) Trieste, Cirina has more than 30 years of experience in insurance and is considered by many within the group as the natural successor to the current CEO, enjoying great respect by all staff."" 
Under Donnet, Generali has delivered higher total returns for shareholders than rivals such as AXA and Allianz (DE:ALVG) and analysts had said Caltagirone needed a strong name to challenge a CEO who has delivered on targets.
Strengthening Donnet's hand, Generali on Tuesday posted a record operating profit for 2021.
Caltagirone also proposed Claudio Costamagna, a former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker and former chairman of Italian state investor CDP, to chair Generali's board.
Calatagiorne has a stake of just under 8% in the insurer, according to latest available data. After stepping down from Generali's board earlier this year he is no longer obligated to disclose his stakebuilding unless he crosses the 10% threshold.

A representative for Del Vecchio has also quit Generali's board. The two tycoons and a third smaller Generali investor held a combined 16% stake in Generali and had struck a shareholder pact which they have now dissolved to avoid drawing regulatory scrutiny.
To counter their weight at the April AGM, Mediobanca has secured a temporary 17.2% voting stake for the April meeting by borrowing shares to beef up its 12.8% holding.

(Reuters) -U.S. carriers on Tuesday said travel demand has roared back after a blip caused by the Omicron coronavirus variant and would remain strong enough to help them offset a run-up in fuel costs with higher fares.
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) said it was seeing an ""unparalleled"" increase in demand, resulting in the highest ticket sales in the company's history last week.
""We've not seen a stronger demand ... in my career,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian said.
Rivals United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) also said the demand is higher than it has ever been. In an encouraging sign for the industry, United said business traffic is rebounding more quickly than expected.
As a result, carriers now expect their revenue in the quarter through March to be stronger than what they estimated in January.
United, for example, said its quarterly revenue would be near the higher end of its forecast, thanks to stronger business traffic. 
While Russia's invasion of Ukraine has forced the closure of vast swaths of airspace, Bastian said Delta has not seen any impact on bookings for flights to Europe.
Similarly, JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said the company is seeing a ""spectacular"" rebound in travel demand between the United States and the United Kingdom. 
The NYSE Arca Airline index was up about 4% in afternoon trade, led by gains in shares of Delta, American Airlines and United Airlines. 
Carriers are counting on strong demand to deal with fuel costs, which have surged after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow has termed a ""special military operation.""
Fuel is their second-biggest expense after labor, but major U.S. airlines do not hedge against volatile oil prices like most European airlines. The industry typically looks to offset fuel costs with higher fares.
HIGHER FARES
Delta said it needs to raise ticket prices by about 10% each way to cover the fuel costs. It intends to do that in the second quarter.
It is not alone. United is passing along a majority of its fuel cost to customers. The company said the resultant higher fares have not impacted demand, thus far.
Tammy Romo, chief financial officer at Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), told an investor conference that the pricing environment has been healthy. The Texas-based carrier has also raised its fares.
Soaring fuel costs have raised concerns among investors about its potential impact on the airline industry, which has spent two years trying to recover from the downturn caused by COVID-19. But industry executives downplayed those concerns.
""We can make money at oil prices of $100 a barrel or higher, and we will,"" said Chief Executive of American Airlines Doug Parker. Delta's Bastian said he was not at ""a point of nervousness"" about rising oil prices.
Capacity constraints at carriers due to staffing shortages and delays in aircraft deliveries along with robust demand have boosted their pricing power. The announcements on Tuesday to trim capacity is expected to further drive up ticket prices and help soften the blow from higher fuel costs.

JetBlue's Hayes, however, sounded cautious about the outlook for travel demand in the second half of the year amid persistent high inflation and expectations of higher interest rates.
""We have to be a little bit cautious as we go into the second half of the year - what do we think the economy is going to do,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of a volatility-tracking exchange-traded note (ETN) soared to a near 10-month high on Tuesday, a day after British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said it had suspended the sales and issuance of the shares due to capacity constraints. 
Shares of iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN jumped as much as 45% to a high of $41.61, before paring gains to trade up 16.4%.
ETNs are debt securities that banks issue with the promise to pay holders a return linked to the performance of underlying securities or benchmarks. Investors are particularly sensitive about the product ever since another volatility-tracking ETN called XIV went bust in a matter of days in February 2018, dealing nearly $2 billion in losses to shareholders.
The sharp rise in VXX shares compounded losses for short sellers who had targeted the volatility ETN. 
Short sellers, who sell borrowed shares, looking to make a profit by buying back the shares at a later date at a lower price, on paper were down $463 million, or 74%, for the year-to-date, according to S3 Partners.
That includes about $189 million in losses on Tuesday alone, S3 Partners data showed.
VXX issuer Barclays, which expects to reopen sales and issuances of VXX and another oil-related ETN as soon as it can accommodate additional capacity, said it does not have sufficient capacity to support further sales from inventory and any further issuances.
The suspension of the share creation process means VXX's shares can stray far from their indicative price - where they should be trading based on the value of their underlying securities.
Typically, large banks buy and sell shares to generally keep the trading price of the ETNs in line with their indicative value. But with the suspension of new shares that process can break.

VXX was last trading up at $33.81, about $7.5 higher than its indicative price. At one point it traded $14 higher than its indicative price. 
""(That's a) massive premium ... this is almost like the AMC short squeeze, buyers attacking the name knowing they can't create shares,"" Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializes in volatility trading, said.

Ukraine is a key exporter of neon gas, which is needed to produce already scarce automotive microchips, while Moscow's invasion is also disrupting transport routes.
""The company has made it clear that ... in recent weeks, the dramatic situation of the war between Russia and Ukraine, with those territories as leading producers of raw material to produce microchips, makes any kind of production planning harder and harder,"" metalworker unions said in a joint statement after meeting the company.
As a consequence, starting from April 4, weekly production shifts will be reduced to 15 from 17, resulting in some 1,500 workers a day being put on furlough, unions said.

The company declined to comment.
The Melfi plant in southern Italy, where Stellantis produces vehicles including Compass and Renegade Jeep models, resumed operations this week after a 10 day stoppage which affected all its over 7,000 workers, amid a global chip shortage and a protest by truck drivers.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 rallied Tuesday, led by a rebound in tech ahead of the Federal Reserve decision on Wednesday.
The S&P 500 rose 1.4%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.2%, or 399 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.8%.
Tech found its footing, climbing more than 2% intraday as the recent weakness in big tech and chip stocks appeared to entice dip-buying action.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) led the gains in big tech, with both up more than 2%, while NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) also racked up gains.
Also helping tech, Treasury yields took a breather somewhat from their recent melt-up just as the Fed kicked off its two-day meeting.
With the odds of the 25-basis point nearly fully priced in, investor attention will be focused on the Fed’s summary of economic projections to gauge the shift in interest rate expectations for this year.  
Commentary on how committed the Fed is on tackling inflation will also be closely watched. If the central bank indicates that it favors a wait and see approach that could stoke worries about whether the Fed is able to get inflation under control at time when slowing growth expectations has increased the risk of recession ahead. 
“I think the market will be disappointed if the Fed strikes a tone that we're going to raise rates by 25 basis points and then see how things go,” Dean Smith, chief strategist and portfolio manager at FolioBeyond said in an interview with Investing.com on Tuesday.
Sentiment on the broader market was also helped by easing concerns that higher for longer oil prices would dent global growth as Crude Oil WTI Futures fell further below $100 a barrel.
 Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO),  Baker Hughes  (NYSE:BKR),  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) were among the biggest decliners in the energy sector, which was the only sector in the red.
The fall in oil prices wasn’t stemmed by signs that an imminent diplomatic solution to end war appears to be some ways off. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly said that “Kyiv is not demonstrating a serious attitude towards finding mutually acceptable solutions.""
Industrials, meanwhile, were pushed higher by the airline stocks after Southwest, United Airline and Delta reported stronger than expected bookings and signaled a quicker than expected recovery in travel demand.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were up more than 7%.

The Swedish automaker maker said that its pilot installations would include as many as 60 Volvo-branded ChargePoint DC fast chargers at up to 15 Starbucks store locations.
Volvo, which plans to have a charger installed at every 100 miles, said it expects the installations to be completed by the end of 2022. The charging stations could be used by all EV drivers for a fee. However, Volvo car owners could use these at no charge or at preferential rates.
The move comes as automakers race to overtake EV maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, with Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co on Monday unveiling plans for seven new electric models that it plans to launch in Europe.

Volvo Cars, which is primarily owned by China's Geely Holding, aims to sell 50% pure electric cars by the middle of this decade and fully electric cars by 2030.
The Biden administration last month also unveiled its plan to award nearly $5 billion over five years to build thousands of electric vehicle charging stations to help combat this issue.

Peter da Silva Vint, an executive director in the shareholder advisory and activism defense group at Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co, will join Barclays as a director in a few months, a Barclays spokesperson said.
Barclays also hired a more junior executive from  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) to join the team next month, the spokesperson added.

The Barclays hires come as more investors prod corporations to consider spinning off business units or even selling the whole company.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks closed higher in New York on Tuesday, with the market resisting continued downward pressure from large-cap Chinese ADRs.
By 4:08 PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 599 points, or 1.8%. The market was cheered by the unwinding of price spikes in oil and other industrial and agricultural commodities. The abrupt rises in commodity prices in the immediate aftermath of Russia's invasion had stoked fears of inflation and of a broad economic slowdown. 
The S&P 500 rose 2.1% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 2.9%. 
The Nasdaq had underperformed on Monday due to intense selling pressure in Chinese ADRs, amid fears of a Covid-induced economic slowdown and the risk that U.S. authorities may forcibly delist them from U.S. exchanges. That threat is long-standing but has acquired extra urgency since U.S. officials warned China that it would face consequences if it chose to help Russia get around Western sanctions. Seven hours of 'intense' talks between National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi failed to clarify which way China will ultimately jump.
The market is turning its attention to the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting which starts later Tuesday and is expected to end with a 25 basis point rise in the fed funds target rate on Wednesday. The Fed is meeting at a time when consumer inflation is running at a 40-year high, while producer price data confirmed that U.S. companies are continuing to raise prices. The annual PPI hit 10% in the 12 months through February, meeting expectations, and rose 0.8% from January, lighter than expected. The Empire State Manufacturing Index fell 11.8, when expectations had been for a reading of 7. 
One company likely to be in the spotlight for its pricing will be Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which earlier announced its second price hike in a week in the U.S.
On the plus side, there are signs that commodity markets may be returning to normal after a wild surge in volatility since the invasion of Ukraine. U.S. crude futures were down 7.5%, while Brent was down 7.5%.
Crude oil was trading back below $100 a barrel for the first time in two weeks after Russia's Foreign Ministry talked up the possibility of a breakthrough on lifting sanctions on Iran. The talks had broken down last week after Russia insisted that its trade with Iran not be included under the sanctions imposed by the West on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. 
Elsewhere, gold futures also retreated 2%, to $1,917 an ounce.

In 2004, Michelin became the first international tyre company to open its own production in Russia, with sales in the country currently representing 2% of the group's total and 1% of its global passenger car tyre production, Michelin said in a statement. 
The group's only plant in Russia, Davydovo, repairs truck tyres and produces up to 2 million new car tyres per year, mainly for the Russian market and some Northern European countries.
""The plant was already working at a very low level since several days. There is a lot of supply difficulties - which means we have disruption of financial flows, and there's a problem of currency instability,"" the company's spokesperson told Reuters.

Michelin was looking for alternative supply sources in Asia and the Middle East, the spokesperson said, adding the group would continue to pay the wages of the more than 1,000 people it employs in Russia, including 750 at the Davydovo plant.
It had stopped sales of plane tyres and mining tyres following U.S. sanctions, before halting exports completely on Tuesday.

""The record drop in the euro-zone ZEW economic sentiment index in March, published today, highlights how much the war in Ukraine has unnerved investors,"" said Jessica Hinds, Europe economist at Capital Economics. 
However, Hinds says a recession at this stage is unlikely given that the relationship between the survey and GDP growth is not close.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Amazon on Tuesday gained unconditional EU antitrust approval for its proposed $8.5 billion acquisition of U.S. movie studio MGM to help it to compete with streaming rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+.
The European Commission said the deal would not pose competition concerns in Europe, confirming a Reuters story on March 9.
The EU competition enforcer said it had looked into overlaps between the world's largest online retailer and MGM in audio-visual content and found that the combined market shares are low and that they have strong rivals.
""The addition of MGM's content into Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime Video offer would not have a significant impact on Amazon's position as provider of marketplace services,"" the Commission said.
Amazon said it was pleased with the EU clearance.
The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has a mid-March deadline to decide on the deal, a person familiar with the matter said.

Analysts said the deal would boost Amazon's video streaming service and attract people to subscribe to Amazon Prime, which also offers fast shipping and encourages consumers to shop more regularly.
MGM has the rights to James Bond, one of the most lucrative franchises in film history having earned nearly $7 billion at the box office globally.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union has banned top credit rating firms from rating Russia and the country's companies as part of its latest sanctions package, the European Commission said on Tuesday. 
""These sanctions https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_22_1761 will further contribute to ramping up economic pressure on the Kremlin and cripple its ability to finance its invasion of Ukraine,"" the Commission said in a statement, adding the package of measures had been ""coordinated with international partners, notably the United States"".
Neither the U.S. Treasury, Britain's Foreign Office nor the UK Financial Conduct Authority which regulates ratings in Europe's largest financial centre responded to requests for comment.
The top three global ratings agencies, S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI), Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch, would risk losing their licences to operate in the EU if they flouted the ban.
All three have already withdrawn or suspended a handful of Russian corporate ratings for firms under the toughest U.S. OFAC sanctions, but Tuesday's step on the face of it would force dozens more.
S&P Global declined to comment on the Commission's announcement when asked by Reuters. Fitch said it ""complies with all relevant regulations for credit rating agencies"", while Moody's did not respond to emails or calls. 
Other measures in the EU's package included an import ban on Russian steel products currently under EU safeguard measures, which it estimated would amount to approximately 3.3 billion euros ($330.15 million) in lost export revenue for Russia. 
There was also an export ban on luxury goods such as luxury cars and jewellery, and an increase in the number of sanctioned wealthy individuals with links to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The measures also come just a day before Russia is due to make its first international market bond payments since being blanketed by Western sanctions.

If the payments are not made by the end of an April 15 'grace period' Russia would be in default on its international debt for the first time since the Bolshevik revolution over a century ago.

The companies raised spending on share repurchases by 2,182% in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period, handily beating the second-place 279% increase by financial firms. The energy industry accounted for 2.8% of a record $881.7 billion in buybacks in all of 2021.
The rapid increase in energy buybacks came before this year’s 28% increase in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices, though energy costs had started to increase in May of 2020. The jump in prices and buybacks represents a bonanza for shareholders, though not necessarily for the long-term industry prospects.

Investing.com – Zoom Video stock (NASDAQ:ZM) traded 3% higher Tuesday after Benchmark upgraded the stock to buy with a target of $124, still more than 26% higher than the prevailing $97.50 level.  
Analyst Matthew Harrigan called the target “conservative,” according to StreetInsider.
The analyst sees a huge opportunity for Zoom as less than 20% of the Global 2000 are currently spending more than $100,000 annually with Zoom.
Zoom was arguably the biggest winner of the pandemic as individuals and corporates turned to its video conferencing app to connect and carry out both personal and official work. As the pandemic waned and more people returned to offices, the need for the services was felt less. The stock is now down nearly 73% in the last year against nearly 6% gains in the S&P 500. 
The brokerage holds “high regard for management, especially CEO Eric Yuan” with the analyst saying the current price attaches nil credibility to Zoom realizing platform “happiness ambitions.""
The analyst pointed out that the company is now deploying more people in non-U.S. markets to push sales while the renewals continue to be very strong, especially for large companies."

MILAN (Reuters) -UniCredit is studying ways to exit Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, but needs to find a solution for its 4,000 local staff and European companies it serves which are also trying to leave, the Italian bank's CEO said.
With France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) and Austria's Raiffeisen, UniCredit is among European lenders most exposed to Russia, where it runs the country's 14th-largest bank.
It has flagged an up to 7.4 billion euro ($8 billion) loss in a worst-case scenario that wiped out its Russian business.
""We're completing an urgent review of the country and we're considering exit,"" CEO Andrea Orcel told the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) European Financial Conference in London.
The former UBS banker said however that leaving was an extremely complex decision which could take time.
""It would be quite easy for me to say that we're leaving Russia. It would be what we all want to do and it is what our minds and bodies demand ... but we need to seriously consider the impact ... of disentangling a full bank from the country.""
UniCredit Russia has around 8 billion euros in loans, locally funded by deposits. 
Relinquishing the business would cost 1.9 billion euros at most. But cross-border and derivatives exposure add up to another 5.5 billion euros to the bill.
Orcel said tackling the latter was a matter of ""unwinding and netting"" and figuring out loan recovery rates at maturity, with clients such as Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) currently paying regularly.
The decision on local operations had wider repercussions, with UniCredit's 1,250 European corporate clients in Russia expecting the bank to ""accompany them in the disentanglement."" 
Exiting ""has an impact on clients and people and that can be very fast if I find a solution or slower if I need to go in another direction which is what we're evaluating,"" he said.
Shutting down its Russian operations would shave 200 million euros off UniCredit's 2022 net income.
STAGFLATION THREAT
Rival Italian heavyweight Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) is also reviewing its presence in Russia, where it has financed major projects but has no retail business. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) are all winding down their operations in Russia.
Less than three months ago, Orcel had looked into swapping UniCredit Russia for a controlling stake in local rival Otkritie, but political risks made him drop the deal. 
Orcel said UniCredit could still deliver on its cash distribution goals, possibly reducing investments and risk weighted assets to offset worsening economic conditions compared with December when he unveiled a new three-year strategy.
""We'll have a shock, we expect recession and we expect inflation,"" he said, adding some of the bank's clients already could not cope with electricity costs and were shutting down.
UniCredit has confirmed its 2021 cash dividends in the worst case scenario. A proposed up to 2.6 billion euro share buyback is contingent on core capital staying above a 13% threshold. [nL2N2VB35N]
""Rough cut, if we recover 40 to 50% of our Russian exposure we will be performing the share buyback in full,"" he said.

With the buyback costing 0.8-1.0 percentage points of core capital, UniCredit could still execute it in part if it recovered less.
Orcel also cautioned that the crisis had further raised the bar for M&A deals given excess capital would be used in part to cushion the shock. ($1 = 0.9094 euros)

NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Dispute settlement talks between Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and India's Future Retail failed over the U.S. group's demand for the return of at least $200 million it had invested in the Indian firm, two sources told Reuters. 
Amazon has for months blocked the $3.4 billion sale of Future's retail assets to rival Reliance, announced in 2020, citing a breach of certain contracts. Future denied any wrongdoing, and hopes had risen recently of an out-of-court settlement after Amazon and Future agreed to talks.
On Tuesday, the two sides told India's Supreme Court, which is hearing the dispute, the talks had collapsed, and Amazon took out newspaper ads criticising both Reliance and Future.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the settlement talks told Reuters that Amazon representatives informed Future the dispute could end if the U.S. company could get back at least $200 million it invested in a Future unit in 2019 - the transaction at the heart of ongoing legal disputes.
Future instead offered a stake of an equivalent amount in one of its remaining group companies after Reliance takes over most of its retail assets, saying it was financially distressed. But Amazon did not accept that, the sources said.
Future and Amazon did not respond to emails seeking comment.
One of the sources said there were more factors at play during the talks, but Amazon's demand for the return of investment was the ""bare minimum"" the U.S. company wanted.
The settlement talks were triggered after Reliance, India's biggest retailer, stunned Amazon when it began taking over key Future Retail outlets on Feb. 25 with its staff suddenly showing up at many of Future's biggest stores to assume control, in what was seen as a de facto takeover.

Earlier on Tuesday, Amazon ran large ads in leading Indian newspapers headlined ""PUBLIC NOTICE"" and alleging actions taken by Reliance and Future had been ""done in a clandestine manner.""
Future, which has $4 billion in overall debt, has said it is staring at insolvency if its deal to sell retail assets to Reliance fails.

LONDON (Reuters) - Coffee traders are scrambling to redirect shipments headed for Russia and Ukraine as trade flows to the two countries collapse due to Western sanctions imposed on Moscow and Kyiv's move to close its ports.
Russia is the world's fourth-largest coffee importer after the European Union, the United States and Japan. 
""(Trade flows) are grinding to a halt. Realistically these contracts will have to be voided. It's as simple as that,"" said a Geneva-based coffee trader at a major international firm.
Russia and Ukraine combined account for nearly 4% of global coffee consumption.
The two countries largely import robusta coffee beans, which are often used to make instant coffee. The beans are a cheaper alternative to smoother-tasting arabica.
The world's biggest container shipping lines, including the top three - MSC, Maersk and CMA CGM - have temporarily suspended cargo shipments to and from Russia, while Ukraine's ports have been closed since Russia invaded.
""Some (shipping) lines have said they'll still (ship to Russia) but the rouble devaluation has effectively frozen that market. (Russian) roasters can't afford (to buy),"" said a Europe-based coffee trader at an international firm.
The rouble has lost more than 30% against the dollar since the invasion and international roasters still operating in the country fear demand will collapse as local prices have roughly tripled.
""We expect to see a significant drop in consumption in (Russia and Ukraine). The combined effect of the war and very high coffee prices will likely lead to a drop in demand,"" Rabobank said in a note.
A Geneva-based trader said he could not even get hold of his buyers in Ukraine and was having to take unilateral decisions on cancelling the contracts and redirecting shipments.

Three coffee exporters at major export firms in Vietnam, the world's top robusta producer, said there were virtually no shipments to Russia last week, with one exporter saying he was working with Russian clients to cancel contracts.
""Based on the current situation and the government's recommendation, agricultural exports to Russia, including coffee, will fall sharply"", said the exporter, who is based in Ho Chi Minh City.

Investing.com – Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) stock edged 0.8% higher on Tuesday after the chipmaker selected sites in Europe to bolster its efforts at reclaiming its past glory in the hi-tech business.
The company said it will build a big chipmaking complex in Germany, boost existing capacity at its Ireland factory, set up a design and research facility in France, and a packaging and assembly site in Italy.
With an initial investment of 33 billion euros ($36 billion), including 17 billion euros for the German plans, the spending will help meet surging demand for chips used in computers, cars, mobiles and other gadgets. Rivals like TSMC, Samsung (KS:005930) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are raising their investments to build capacities at a time when both corporations and individuals are pivoting to a digital life.  
Intel has already committed more than $150 billion in spending on creating new chip-making capacities over 10 years as it attempts to de-risk its business from excessive reliance on China for critical components.

Sberbank has been developing its non-financial businesses, such as e-commerce, technology and cloud services, in an attempt to combat shrinking margins, a process it looks determined to continue even as sanctions shutter its operations elsewhere. 
The lender quit almost all its European markets earlier this month, blaming big cash outflows and threats to its staff and property, a move that seemed inevitable after the European Central Bank ordered the closure of its European arm. 
In partnership with electronics retailer M.Video, Sberbank has started selling the televisions, which use the bank's virtual assistant software and offer services such as online streaming and food delivery from its digital ecosystem.

Sberbank does not disclose how much it spends on technology, but the bank has previously told Reuters it is a huge investment and one that it has increased since it shifted its strategy to focus more on technology devices and solutions.
Majority owned by Russia's government, Sberbank's share price has plummeted since Russia began its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine and Western nations imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia's financial sector.

Rodent activity and Salmonella contamination at a Family Dollar distribution center in Arkansas recently led to a recall of drugs, cosmetics, human and animal foods from 404 stores in six U.S. states, including Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana.
Dollar Tree said earlier this month it incurred a $34.1 million hit due to the recall.
Rodent contamination may cause Salmonella and infectious diseases, which may pose the greatest risk to infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly and immuno-compromised people, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said last month.
The FDA also said conditions observed during the inspection of the facility included live rodents and dead rodents in various states of decay.
A review of Dollar Tree's internal records also indicated the collection of more than 2,300 rodents between March 29 and Sept. 17, demonstrating a history of infestation, the health agency added.
Dollar Tree's regulatory filing on Tuesday showed the Eastern District of Arkansas requested the production of information, documents and records pertaining to pests, sanitation and its compliance with law.

The grand jury subpoena is a powerful investigative tool of the federal government used to identify and gather evidence about a certain federal crime.
""We intend to cooperate fully with the subpoena and any related investigation, however, no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of this matter,"" Dollar Tree said in the filing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday unveiled a new pilot effort to help clear supply chain bottlenecks at congested U.S. ports by getting truckers, shippers, wholesalers, retailers and other businesses to share information.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and National Economic Council Director Brian Deese launched the Freight Logistics Optimization Works (FLOW), an information sharing initiative ""to pilot key freight information exchange between parts of the goods movement supply chain.""
The White House said ""the lack of digital infrastructure and transparency makes our supply chains brittle and unable to adapt when faced with a shock"" and said it was crucial to improve information sharing because a ""lack of information exchange can cause delays as cargo moves from one part of the supply chain to another, driving up costs and increasing goods movement fragility.""
The effort includes 18 initial participants including FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS, Albertsons,  Target  (NYSE:TGT) as well as the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles and Georgia Ports Authority and Ocean Carriers CMA CGM and MSC and Fenix Marine Terminal and Global Container Terminals.
Buttigieg noted U.S. supply chains are mostly private or locally owned and this new effort required a public partnership.
""If it doesn't work on a handshake it doesn't work. Nobody can command this kind of sharing but we also know it needs to happen,"" Buttigieg said at a White House event.
Last week, the National Retail Federation (NRF) said imports at the major U.S. retail container ports are expected to be at near-record levels this spring and summer as consumer demand and supply chain challenges continue to spark congestion.
""Growth rates have slowed down from the off-the-charts numbers we saw last year, but volume is close to the highest we’ve ever seen. Everyone in the supply chain is trying to reduce congestion, but there is still work to be done,"" NRF said.
The White House said the 18 participants will work to develop a ""proof-of-concept freight information exchange by the end of the summer"" aiming ""to ease supply chain congestion.""

President Joe Biden created a task force in June to address high prices and shortages of consumer goods and crucial components, thanks to pandemic-related labor and demand issues.
Buttigieg noted Tuesday that 2021 worst case fears did not materialize. ""Christmas was not in fact canceled."" Buttigieg said.

However, ""Apptopia tracking through early March still suggests NFLX is running ahead of plan,"" said the analyst. Apptopia is a data intelligence platform that provides its users with mobile app analytics.
""If NFLX were to conclude 1Q at its recent pace, we believe Net Adds could be 4M+, down from the 5M+ implied by our regression in mid-February, but above the 2.5M guide,"" stated Anmuth.
He added that the 4 million is before they factored in the suspension of Russia, but they estimate this will reduce subscribers by around 300,000.
Despite the slowdown, Anmuth is still bullish on the stock, keeping an Overweight rating and $605 price target.

BERLIN (Reuters) -A lack of wiring harnesses from Ukraine has overtaken a shortage of semiconductors as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s biggest supply chain headache as the Russia-Ukraine war clouds its prospects for this year, the world's No.2 carmaker warned on Tuesday. 
Rising raw material costs will drive up prices for both electric and internal combustion engine vehicles, Chief Financial Officer Arno Antlitz said, with everything from batteries to catalytic converters set to become more expensive.
In light of rising instability in Europe, boosting sales in China - where Volkswagen currently has 16% market share and aims to double battery-electric car sales this year - is an even higher priority than before, CEO Herbert Diess added.
""The war in the Ukraine has put our existing outlook into question,"" Diess said at the German group's annual press conference following Friday's 2021 results, warning commodity markets are likely to remain volatile until 2026.
Rival Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) on Tuesday raised prices in China and the United States for the second time in days after its CEO noted surging raw materials and logistics costs.
Diess said Volkswagen had become more resilient through the coronavirus pandemic and under normal circumstances would have reason for optimism for 2022.
The group cut overhead costs ahead of schedule last year, leading to 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) of benefits compared with 2019, said Antlitz. 
The potential initial public offering (IPO) of sports car brand Porsche will provide additional flexibility, he said, adding an IPO could still happen as soon as the fourth quarter of 2022, despite current market uncertainties. 
However, a halt in supplies of wire harnesses, which bundle up to 5 km (3.1 miles) of cables in a car and are unique to each model, could force Volkswagen to revise its outlook if alternative sources are not found in 3-4 weeks, Diess said.
The carmaker is relocating production from Ukraine to North Africa and Eastern Europe - a process which is not complicated but time-consuming, the CEO said. 
Volkswagen sold two million fewer cars than planned last year due to semiconductor shortages and said that, while the situation should improve this year, there could still be a drag on growth.
The carmaker said on Friday its operating profit doubled in 2021 to just under 20 billion euros thanks to higher prices and a favourable product mix, despite total unit deliveries hitting a 10-year low of 8.9 million.
Looking forward, it expects to increase deliveries by 5-10% in 2022 and boost revenues by 8-13%, it said on Friday. 

Both Volkswagen and Japan's Toyota suspended production temporarily at some plants in China amid COVID-related lockdowns, with Toyota warning on Tuesday the suspensions could last several more weeks.

At 10:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 161.23 points, or 0.76%, at 21,019.55.

""TSX is definitely overweight in commodities versus other indices so as long as inflation's a theme it should set the TSX to outperform.""
The commodity-heavy Toronto index has declined 1.1% so far this year, but has outperformed many of its global peers like the U.S. benchmark S&P 500, which is down 11.8% year-to-date, as investors embraced commodity stocks to protect their portfolios from the impact of supply shortages and soaring inflation.
Investors await key consumer price data due later in the week, while the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting due on Wednesday was also in focus.
""There's probably not going be much volume today as investors are waiting for the Fed's signals and see if we get any relief in the move higher in yields and the U.S. dollar,"" Taylor said.

(Reuters) -""Saturday Night Live"" comic Pete Davidson has been confirmed as the next celebrity in line for a ride to the edge of space courtesy of Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin astro-tourism company, with his suborbital flight set for next week.
The 28-year-old comedian and boyfriend of socialite and reality TV star Kim Kardashian was announced by Blue Origin on Monday as an ""honorary guest"" joining five paying customers for the company's fourth commercial flight since last summer. 
Davidson, who had no immediate comment on his selection, was reported to have been in discussions with Blue Origin earlier this month.
His five fellow citizen astronauts-to-be are: angel investor Marty Allen, real estate veteran Marc Hagle and his wife Sharon Hagle, University of North Carolina professor Jim Kitchen and George Nield, founder-president of Commercial Space Technologies.
They are slated for liftoff on March 23 aboard Blue Origin's six-story-tall, fully autonomous spacecraft, dubbed New Shepard, from the company launch site outside the rural west Texas town of Van Horn.
The entire flight, from liftoff to touchdown, is expected to last a little over 10 minutes. The crew will experience a few minutes of weightlessness at the very apex of their suborbital joyride, some 350,000 feet (106 km) high, then will fall back to Earth for a parachute landing on the desert floor.
Davidson, a nine-year ""SNL"" cast member who co-wrote and starred in the semi-autobiographical film ""The King of Staten Island,"" is the latest of several celebrities chosen as non-paying promotional Blue Origin passengers.

He follows in the footsteps of 90-year-old ""Star Trek"" actor William Shatner, whose October ride made him the oldest person ever to fly to space, and ""Good Morning America"" co-host Michael Strahan, a former NFL star. Strahan flew in December with 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, eldest daughter of the late pioneering NASA astronaut Alan Shepard, for whom the Blue Origin rocketship is named.
Bezos himself tagged along on Blue Origin's inaugural crewed flight to space in July of last year with his brother Mark Bezos, trailblazing octogenarian female aviator Wally Funk and 18-year-old Oliver Daeman, a Dutch high school graduate and beneficiary of a $28 million auction sweepstakes.

Investing.com – eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) stock traded 3.6% higher Tuesday after  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) initiated coverage with a ‘buy’ and a target of $145, more than 168% higher than its current level of $54.
According to StreetInsider analyst Lee Horowitz, the market is underappreciating eBay's positioning within secular growth trends. He finds the stock’s valuations compelling.
eBay’s fourth-quarter results had disappointed but weren’t a surprise either given that shoppers were bound to log off the site after two years of the pandemic to step out and shop.
Fourth-quarter gross merchandise volume, a key benchmark defining the total value of goods and services sold on an online platform, fell 10% to go below $21 billion. E-commerce firms’ revenue is derived from a percentage of GMV. 
Annual active buyers on the platform also declined 9% to 147 million in the quarter.
The retailer is forecasting annual revenue of $10.4 billion and adjusted profit per share of $4.3 at the midpoint of its guidance range. GMV is seen between $78.3 billion and $80.5 billion, a guidance the analyst called “conservative”.
As the company’s core operations remain under pressure, CEO Jamie Iannone is banking on advertising and payments businesses to make up for it. The company's advertising offerings surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the year. With the complete transition of all sellers to a new payments platform, the company expects the shift to contribute to profits.
According to Horowitz, the market is also underappreciating the focus on execution that Iannone has brought to the company after taking over less than two years ago."

RWE earlier reported final results for 2021, which showed a 25% increase in both adjusted net profit as well as generation from brown coal, or lignite, which is among the most CO2 intense energy sources.
""Given the significantly elevated price of electricity RWE's very solid 2021 results come expected,"" Enkraft said, adding a separation from lignite was ""the only way for RWE to become green in the foreseeable future"".

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday, as the first lower-than-expected price data in months and a sharp drop in oil prices combined to relieve some of the anxiety around galloping inflation.
The producer price index rose by 0.8% on the month in February, a shade less than the 0.9% expected. But the core PPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by only 0.2%, well below expectations and its lowest rise in five months. The last time that the core PPI had risen by less was in December 2020. A string of rapid price increases by U.S. companies still leaves the year-on-year PPI at 10.0%, however, an uncomfortable backdrop for the start of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later Tuesday.
The mood was also helped by more conciliatory statements from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky talking down the prospects of Ukraine joining NATO, a concession to Russia's security demands that may advance the hitherto fruitless peace talks between the two countries.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 151 points, or 0.5% at 33,097 points. The S&P 500 was also up 0.5% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 0.3%. All three indices were paring the gains they had made at the open.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 0.3% after the electric vehicle maker illustrated the problem of producer price inflation at the company level. The company raised its prices for almost all of its output in the U.S. and China for the second time in a week. While it didn't explain why, the moves come after a surge in battery metals Copper and - especially - Nickel since the Russian invasion. Russia is one of the world's largest sources of nickel, and its output would be sorely missed on world markets if Western sanctions bite as they are supposed to. 
Airline stocks rose sharply after Delta (NYSE:DAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) all said they intend to work at slightly lower levels of capacity than foreseen earlier. That reduces the risk of margins being crushed by flying half-full planes at a time when fuel prices have skyrocketed. The sector, which is still struggling to put the wave of Omicron-variant Covid-19 behind it had underperformed badly during the first two weeks of the war, faced not only with soaring fuel costs but also by the closure of Russian airspace, which makes their long-distance routes to Asia more challenging."

A growing list of financial firms are looking to exit Russia, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) winding down business there. Others are under pressure from investors to detail their financial exposure to Russia.
UniCredit Chief Executive Andrea Orcel said the bank was urgently reviewing its Russian business, but needed to find a solution for its 4,000 local staff and European companies it serves which are also trying to leave. 
Orcel also said the economic environment had changed because of the Ukraine crisis and the bank was now assuming there would be stagflation - or a combination of low growth and high inflation.
UniCredit's Russian unit has around 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in loans, locally funded by deposits.
The loss in relinquishing the business would be 1.9 billion euros at most. Cross-border and derivatives exposure however add up to another 5.5 billion euros to the bill.
UniCredit is one of Europe's banks most exposed to Russia.
TP ICAP (LON:NXGN), the world's biggest inter-dealer broker, also said on Tuesday it had stopped all business transactions with Russian banks. 
Credit Suisse last week detailed a gross credit exposure of 1.569 billion Swiss francs ($1.69 billion) to Russia at the end of 2021, which Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said had been ""reduced materially"" by the end of February.
Gottstein told the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Conference in London on Tuesday that the bank had ""roughly 4% of our assets under management in wealth management with Russian clients, (either) Russian-domiciled or Russian nationals who live in the West."" 
The bank had not previously detailed the amount of assets it manages for Russian clients.
Russia is subject to stringent sanctions and has introduced countermeasures following the invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special operation.""
In a sign of the pressure, the Russian central bank said it would suspend the buying of gold from banks from Tuesday to meet increased demand for the precious metal from households.
Russia's second-biggest bank VTB is closing its London-based investment banking unit VTB Capital, it said.
Russia has $117 million in payments due on Wednesday on two dollar-denominated Eurobonds. Its finance ministry has said it will make the payments in roubles if sanctions prevent it from paying in dollars. 
However, the payment due on Wednesday has to be made in dollars and using other currencies could constitute a default.
Russia's economic crisis is likely to cause credit to go unpaid but euro zone banks' exposure to the country is contained, the European Central Bank's top supervisor Andrea Enria said, adding no blanket ban on dividends was on the cards.
Western governments continue to ratchet up the pressure as three European prime ministers rode a train for Kyiv on Tuesday, the first visit by foreign leaders to the Ukrainian capital since Russia launched its invasion.
The European Union has banned top credit rating firms from rating Russia's sovereign debt and the country's companies as part of its latest sanctions package, the European Commission said. 
Britain imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russian individuals and entities, banned the export of luxury goods to Russia and said it had stopped all government-backed export finance to Russia and Belarus.

Commercial insurance market Lloyd's of London said it was looking to apply sanctions pressure on Russia through the cyber, aerospace and political risk insurance markets.

Investing.com – Hycroft Mining (NASDAQ:HYMC) stock was up 97% in premarket trading Tuesday after AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) is reportedly buying a stake in the precious metals development company.
The multiplex operator, along with Canadian fund manager Eric Sprott, is investing $56 million in the miner as part of diversification efforts. AMC was up 4% premarket.
AMC Chairman and CEO Adam Aron, who often takes to Twitter to make announcements and seek the public’s views on the company’s plans, said Hycroft has 15 million ounces of gold and 600 million ounces of silver.   
""AMC is playing on offense again with a bold diversification move,"" Aron tweeted, noting that AMC would help Hycroft bolster its liquidity. The multiplex operator and Eric Sprott will each own 21.8% of Hycroft.
The company said the strength from the release of blockbusters like ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ and ‘The Batman’ has helped it recover from the pandemic-led fall.
The theater-owner will also receive an additional 23.4 million warrants in Hycroft at $1.07 per share and has been granted the right to appoint a representative to Hycroft's board.
Investment firm Mudrick Capital Management is currently the largest shareholder, holding a 40.38% stake, according to Refinitiv data.
AMC was at the heart of the meme stock rally that gripped the markets for more than half of 2021. That frenzy saw the company raise funds, retire debt, accept payment in Bitcoin, and launch non-fungible tokens."

LONDON (Reuters) - Russia's second-biggest bank VTB is closing the London-based arm of its investment banking unit VTB Capital, it said on Tuesday, as Western sanctions continue to throttle the international operations of Russia's lenders.
VTB Capital plc is ""currently proceeding with an orderly wind-down of its positions and obligations,"" the company said, having laid off some of its staff late last week.
VTB's announcement is the latest sign of how U.S., European and British sanctions are hitting Russian financial firms, after the country's biggest lender Sberbank quit Europe blaming cash outflows and threats to its staff and property.
It shows the pressure Russian businesses face from the unprecedented and coordinated action by Western governments to isolate Moscow over its war on Ukraine, including sanctions on its central bank and the exclusion of some lenders from the SWIFT payments system.
Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
Reuters reported earlier this month that regulators were preparing for a possible closure of the European arm of VTB Bank, amid concerns about the impact of Western sanctions on the bank.
The European Union on Tuesday formally approved another barrage of sanctions, including bans on investments in the Russian energy sector, luxury goods exports and imports of steel products from Russia.
ASSETS FROZEN
Britain froze VTB's assets on Feb. 24 as part of its largest-ever package of sanctions against Russia, aimed in part at stopping Russian companies from raising money in London.
As the British-based arm of VTB's investment banking business, VTB Capital Plc lent money to business and advised on mergers and corporate fundraising for Russia-related deals.

It was loss-making prior to the closure announced on Tuesday, a company filing showed, reporting a pretax loss of $213 million in 2020 as it shrank its balance sheet and made provisions for bad loans. 
VTB said that sanctions allowed it to continue paying staff until March 1 next year, as it looks to complete the wind-down of VTB Capital plc.

ZURICH (Reuters) -Credit Suisse is reviewing its operations in Russia, Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein said on Tuesday, as he detailed tens of billions of dollars in assets managed for wealthy Russian customers.
""We're now reviewing the situation. It's a very serious situation,"" Gottstein said during  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s European Financials Conference in London, referring to the impacts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""We will see over the coming months what it means for our operations. I have not taken any decision.""
A growing list of financial firms are looking to exit Russia, with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) winding down business there. 
The comments from Gottstein come just hours after UniCredit's chief executive said the Italian bank was also urgently reviewing its Russian business.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) last week detailed a gross credit exposure of 1.569 billion Swiss francs ($1.69 billion) to Russia at end-2021, which Gottstein said had been reduced ""materially"" by the end of February.
On Tuesday, he outlined for the first time the extent of Credit Suisse's business with wealthy Russian clients, saying roughly 4% of the assets it manages in its core wealth management business belong to Russian clients.
""We have roughly 4% of our assets under management in wealth management with Russian clients, be they Russian-domiciled or Russian nationals who live in the West,"" Gottstein said.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank managed some 1.6 trillion Swiss francs in assets as of end-2021, 827 billion francs of which were related to its wealth management businesses.
While Gottstein did not provide an updated tally for current assets under management, 4% of the year-end wealth management figure would amount to some 33 billion Swiss francs ($35.17 billion) in assets associated with wealthy Russian customers.
The bank last week said it had minimal exposure in terms of loans granted to individuals subject to sanctions in its wealth management division.
Credit Suisse employs some 125 people in its Moscow office across investment banking, wealth management and other operations.

Gottstein said Credit Suisse was also reviewing its broader operations in Eastern Europe.

Investing.com – GitLab Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLB) stock surged 14% in premarket Tuesday after the code-sharing firm’s fourth quarter revenue beat estimates and adjusted loss came in narrower than expected.
Guidance for the current year also boosted the shares.
“We believe these results demonstrate that the market is moving from DIY DevOps composed of different tools to a DevOps Platform. This shift enables organizations to accelerate the time-to-market of their most important software and applications, providing them with a distinct competitive advantage,” CEO Sid Sijbrandij said in a statement.
GitLab’s DevOps platform allows users to work on codes, package them, releasing and monitoring them. The company makes money from its premium products, chargeable on a ‘per user per month’ basis.
Fourth-quarter revenue was up 69% at $78 million as the company signed up new customers and upgraded existing ones which included Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), the US Army, and  Travis Perkins  (LON:TPK). Adjusted gross margin improved by a percentage point.
Adjusted loss per share was 16 cents, almost a third of its year-ago level.
In the current year, the company expects revenue to be at least $385.5 million, up around 53%. It could touch $390.5 million as well, according to the company’s estimated range.
Revenue in the current quarter is seen between $77 million and $78 million."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Acquisition platform Acacia Research Corp, backed by activist fund Starboard Value and a recent bidder for retailer Kohl's Corp (NYSE:KSS), appointed one of the hedge fund's senior executives on Tuesday to oversee all aspects of its takeover business.
The firm, which acquires businesses in sectors including technology, retail, and healthcare, appointed Martin McNulty Jr. as its chief operating officer and head of mergers and acquisitions, Acacia Chief Executive Officer Clifford Press told Reuters.
   The appointment comes after global merger and acquisition activity set new records last year. But the pace of takeovers may be dampened by rising financing costs, expectations of greater regulatory scrutiny mount and as geopolitical unrest unnerves investors.
Acacia also promoted Wesley Golby, its chief of research, to chief investment officer. Golby previously co-founded investment firm Seven Canyons Advisors. The appointments are effective immediately.
McNulty, who goes by MJ, had been CEO of Starboard's special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Starboard Value Acquisition Corp, which combined with data center Cyxtera Technologies Inc last year. The deal valued the company at $3.4 billion. 
    ""Adding MJ to our leadership team completes the build out of our core acquisition platform,"" Press said, adding that McNulty's skills in making operational improvements ""will now be applied to current and prospective portfolio companies.""
Acacia agreed with Starboard two years ago that the hedge fund would provide as much as $400 million in capital for strategic investments and acquisitions.
In late January, Acacia offered to buy Kohl's for $64 a share, making an offer that would have valued the retailer at roughly $9 billion. Kohl's rejected this and another initial offer from private equity firm Sycamore Partners.
    Acacia, which declined to comment on Kohl's, remains in active discussions with the retailer's banker as it runs a sales process, according to sources familiar with the matter.

LONDON (Reuters) - The  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) said on Tuesday it had teamed up with digital private asset platform Floww to enter the market for unlisted companies that want to raise capital.
Britain is reforming its capital market after leaving the European Union to ensure London still attracts global investors.
The UK listings regime has already been eased in a bid to attract more technology firms to the exchange, but the finance ministry also wants to make it easier for private companies to access funds and attract more retail investors.
""LSEG will work with Floww to help launch their private primary capital raising facility, while exploring liquidity and secondary market options, including through the use of new technologies,"" the exchange said in a statement.
Floww allows investors to monitor and track their investments in private companies and already features 7,000 company profiles and 70 venture capital firms.
""With LSEG, we are on course to building a connected network for all market players to share and manage their data, deals and opportunities and the ability to trade shares in companies at any stage,"" Floww CEO Martijn De Wever said.
Many smaller companies have turned their backs on a public listing, citing heavy costs and regulatory requirements, according to a finance ministry consultation paper last year.
Building a bridge between private and public companies is seen as a way to build a pipeline of listings.
""By working together, we can support the widest range of companies through their funding lifecycle including helping them transition from private to public markets,"" LSEG said.

""Our ambition is to be the first global exchange group that is genuinely indifferent as to whether a company is public or private, and Floww is another step in this journey,"" it said.
The finance ministry said this month it was still exploring the idea for a new venue for small and medium sized companies, where trading might take place during regular but limited periods, rather than a full session every week day as on the main market.

Insurers and reinsurers based in London have already stopped providing cover to Russian airlines following sanctions due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""We’ll keep deploying our expertise, resources and networks – covering crucial areas like cyber, space and political risk – to help deliver an effective sanctions regime against Russian assets,"" Lloyd's said in a statement on its website dated March 14.
While Russian firms typically use local insurers for commercial insurance policies, these are often reinsured through Lloyd's, industry sources say.
Companies take out cyber insurance against cyber attacks, while space insurance covers damage to satellites and rockets.
Political risk insurance is typically an add-on to commercial property insurance and can be triggered in the case of issues such as war or nationalisation.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Members Exchange (MEMX), the fastest growing U.S. stock exchange, said on Tuesday it plans to launch an options exchange in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approval, that will seek to reduce industry costs.
MEMX, which counts some of Wall Streets biggest firms among its investors, including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK),  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), launched its stock exchange in September 2020, to address an intense debate over fees between large exchange operators and their customers.
Taking an aggressive approach to pricing, MEMX has gained more than 4% market share, surpassing the volume of some exchanges run by Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc's New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Inc, and Cboe Global Markets (NYSE:CBOE). 
""MEMX Options will use technological advancements to increase determinism, reduce costs and drive competitive improvements for our options members, just as we did in equities,"" said MEMX Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Kellner.
The market operator worked with its members on establishing how to add value to the options space, Kellner said. 
Other MEMX investors include BofA Securities,  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Investments,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), UBS, and Virtu Financial (NASDAQ:VIRT).
The Jersey City, New Jersey-based exchange was founded after years of complaints by brokers and other market participants over what they saw as unjustifiably high fees charged by most exchanges for things like market data and exchange connectivity.

MEMX began charging for market data in February at a significantly lower price than the large incumbent exchanges.

The increases come as costs of raw materials are surging, exacerbated by supply chain disruptions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Prices of metals used in cars have soared, including aluminum that is used in the bodywork, palladium used in catalytic converters, and nickel and lithium that power electric vehicle (EV) batteries.
The costs have raised concerns about EV economics, as legacy automakers and startups prepare to launch new cars on the back of a long semiconductor supply crunch that is still knocking production at companies including Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).

Tesla bought Rusal aluminum for casting parts at its new vehicle assembly plant outside of Berlin for the Tesla Model Y, among other things, CNBC said.
Tesla received a conditional go-ahead for its 5 billion euro ($5.5 billion) German gigafactory earlier this month after months of delay.
Tesla and Rusal did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. carmaker Ford on Monday unveiled plans for seven new electric models in Europe, a battery-assembly site in Germany and a nickel cell manufacturing joint venture in Turkey as part of a major electric vehicle (EV) push on the continent.
""Our march toward an all-electric future is an absolute necessity for Ford to meet the mobility needs of customers across a transforming Europe,"" said Stuart Rowley, chair of Ford of Europe.
Ford said it would introduce three new electric passenger vehicles and four new electric commercial vehicles in Europe by 2024, adding it plans to sell more than 600,000 EVs in the region by 2026.
This, Ford said, would help it reach its global goal of selling more than 2 million EVs a year and achieving an adjusted operating profit margin of 10% by 2026.
The strategy update for Europe comes shortly after Ford announced a $50 billion investment push to kick-start electrification that also includes running its EV unit separately from the group's legacy combustion engine business.
As part of its push, Ford deepened its existing partnership with Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) under which the U.S. carmaker will produce a second electric vehicle for the European market based on its German rival's platform.
Ford will as a result double its planned volume of vehicles to be produced based on Volkswagen's modular electric-drive platform, known as MEB, to 1.2 million units over a six-year timeframe.
This will include investments of $2 billion at Ford's Cologne site in Germany as well as a new battery assembly facility scheduled to start operations in 2024.
Ford also said it has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with SK On Co, a unit of South Korea's SK Innovation, and Turkey's Koc Holding for a joint venture to manufacture high nickel NMC cells for assembly into battery array modules.

Under the strategy update, Ford Otosan, Ford's joint venture with Koc Holding, will buy the U.S. carmaker's plant in Craiova, Romania for 575 million euros ($630 million) to further boost electric and commercial vehicle capacity.

While the final penalty is not known, reports say it could run into billions of yuan.
According to WSJ, there were also lapses in compliance with ‘know your customer’ and ‘know your business’ norms – standard protocols regulators world over mandate entities follow to verify the authenticity of the customer and their eligibility to carry out transactions on the platform.
The breaches were discovered by the country’s central bank in late 2021.
The impending penalty comes as Chinese fintech platforms prepare for stricter regulation of their operations amid their government’s attempts to curb money laundering activities.
The Dutch-listed shares of  Prosus  (AS:PRX), the vehicle that holds South African giant Naspers' Tencent stake, are also bearing the brunt of the impending Chinese action. They are down 10% in today’s trading in Amsterdam after closing as much lower Monday. NYSE-listed shares of Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME), a subsidiary, are down 2.6% in premarket trading after closing 9.3% lower in the previous session.
Tencent has so far been relatively unscathed in Chinese authorities' crackdown on big internet platforms that hurt the likes of  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA), Meituan (OTC:MPNGY), and Didi (NYSE:DIDI). Last year, it complied with the regulators’ demand that it should limit the time children spend on its video games."

""We will shift more into China because of the situation in Europe,"" Diess said. When asked about how the carmaker would respond in the event that China attacked Taiwan, he said that he did not believe the country would take such a step.
""China has a high interest to keep borders open,"" Diess said. ""We think it is an asset for us to be strong in China... China is a stronghold for us.""

The carmaker has suspended production in Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine.
A lack of wire harnesses normally sourced from Ukraine was the most significant supply chain constraint at the moment, Diess said, affecting most German plants. If it could not relocate production in 3-4 weeks, its outlook would need to be revised, Diess said.

(Reuters) -Imperial Brands has started talks to transfer its Russian business to a local third party, the tobacco company said on Tuesday, joining British rival BAT (LON:BATS) in exiting the sanction-hit country following its invasion of Ukraine. 
Imperial, maker of Winston cigarettes and Backwoods cigars, last week stopped all sales and marketing activity in Russia and halted production at its factory in Volgograd, citing challenges arising from sanctions on Moscow. 
The group joins a long list of Western companies that have suspended operations or pulled out of Russia after the United States, the European Union and Britain imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's access to funding.
Russia has hit back with moves towards nationalising assets of firms that leave the country.
Imperial declined to give further details about the third party it is in talks with, or how the deal might be structured. 
The British company, which employs around 1,000 people in Russia, said it would continue to pay its staff there until the transfer of its business is complete.
Camel and Lucky Strike cigarette maker  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) last week also said it would transfer its Russian business, which employs around 2,500 people.
BAT said on Friday exiting its business or stopping sales or manufacturing would be regarded as a criminal bankruptcy by Russia, adding Moscow might under those circumstances take legal action against local management.
Imperial declined to comment on its rationale for transferring the business. 
Imperial, whose operations in Russia and Ukraine accounted for just 2% of its 32.79 billion pounds ($42.69 billion) of net revenue in fiscal 2021, flagged a small hit to annual revenue and profit from the exit. 
It expects revenue growth in 2022 to be flat to up 1% versus a prior forecast of growth of about 1.4% at constant currencies.

Another big tobacco firm, Philip Morris (NYSE:PM), last week also suspended investment in Russia and said it planned to scale down manufacturing in the country that accounts for almost 10% of its total cigarette and heated tobacco volumes.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 06:05AM ET</span>",U.S. banks will keep a toe in Russia despite wind-downs,"By Matt Scuffham and David Henry
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Several of Wall Street's biggest banks are planning on keeping a limited presence and holding on to banking licenses in Russia for the foreseeable future, even as they wind down their broader operations in the country, sources at those banks said. 
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) - the three Wall Street banks with the biggest Russian exposures - have said in the past few days that they plan to pull back their businesses in Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine. 
The banks will continue to have staff and operations on the ground as they work to extricate themselves and some of their clients from contractual obligations, the sources say.
Even when that work is done, however, they are likely to hang on to their banking licenses in the hope that the businesses can be rebuilt at a later date, sources at two of the banks said.
""They are not going to cut and run when there are potential opportunities when this gets resolved,"" said Eric Schiffer, CEO at California-based private equity firm Patriarch Organization and a specialist in risk management strategy. 
A total withdrawal, including handing back licenses, would make it hard for a bank to return, experts say. Obtaining a banking license in Russia is a laborious and lengthy process, experts say, and global banks have often opted to buy a stake in a Russian bank that holds a license.
Citigroup said on Monday it would expand its withdrawal from Russia and not take on new clients as it further cuts its exposure to the country, raising the prospect it could take billions of dollars in losses.
The bank had already planned to exit its Russian consumer business prior to the invasion. It has now decided to expand that exit to include other businesses and to reduce its remaining operations and exposures.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
BANKS TO RETAIN LICENSES 
Citigroup has the most to lose out of U.S. banks withdrawing. It has exposure of nearly $10 billion in Russia, more than any other U.S. bank, and has warned it could lose nearly half of that in the worst-case scenario.
The bank said that its withdrawal would take time to process. It also reiterated a commitment to ""providing assistance to multi-national corporations, many of whom are undergoing the complex task of unwinding their operations.""
Citigroup is likely to keep operations on the ground and retain its banking license in Russia for the foreseeable future, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Citigroup declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs said last week it is ""winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements."" 
But the bank has no current plans to hand back its Russian banking license and, even if it did, would expect that process to take 12 to 18 months, a source familiar with the matter said. 
JPMorgan said last week it has been actively unwinding its business in Russia and is not pursuing new business in the country.
However, it also has no current plans to hand back its banking license in Russia, sources at the bank say.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which faced criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, said on Friday it would wind down its business in the country, reversing an earlier pledge to stay.
However, it is also planning to keep its banking license in Russia for the foreseeable future, sources familiar with the matter say.
One factor preventing JPMorgan and Citigroup from immediate withdrawals is that they are both securities custodians in Russia, said sources at the banks. That means they have obligations to hold securities there for clients. There is no obvious way out of those obligations, the sources said, given restrictions on securities transactions imposed by the Bank of Russia.
JPMorgan and Citigroup also have transaction and treasury services businesses in Russia. They provide cash management, trade services and finance to multinational companies doing business in Russia. Those services will continue to be provided to companies as they suspend or unwind their businesses, sources at both the banks said.
Banks face a lengthy withdrawal that could take years, Reuters reported last week.
However, the slow exit also has its advantages, some experts say, as that method presents an opportunity for banks to change tack and rebuild if the geopolitical situation changes dramatically.

That would not be possible if they had chosen to walk away from Russia entirely, a move that could be seen as hurting Russian citizens.
""There may be a long-term strategy that you don't tarnish the name of the company too much in Russia to the point where Russia will boycott you,"" said Antonia Tzinova, an attorney in global law firm Holland & Knight's Washington, D.C., office.

Investing.com – Stocks of European retailers such as LVMH (PA:LVMH),  Kering  (PA:PRTP), H&M (ST:HMb), Moncler (MI:MONC) and Hermès (PA:HRMS) were all down around 4% Tuesday after the European Union banned exports of luxury goods to Russia.
The ban covers luxury goods worth more than 300 euros ($329.58) and cars costing over 50,000 euros, according to reports. It follows a similar move by the U.S. on Friday.
The new list is part of the fourth set of sanctions brought by the EU against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. Previously sanctioned items include steel, iron ore, and electronic gadgets. 
While Russia is a big market for many of the luxury goods makers, the fear is that China may also get dragged into the sanctions net.
China is one of the biggest makers of these luxury goods, and a key supplier of raw materials that go into making them. The world’s second-largest economy is also a big market for these items.
The bloc is also withdrawing Russia’s ‘most favored nation’ status and pushing for removing the country from the MFN list at the World Trade Organization as well.
The shares were also impacted by a fresh outbreak of Covid-19 in China which has seen several key cities in the country come under fresh lockdowns. These include the economically important regions of Guangdong, Shanghai, Shandong, and Jilin."

SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Manufacturers of everything from flash drives to glass for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone screens are warning of shipment delays as they comply with Chinese controls to curb the spread of COVID-19, further straining global supply chains.
Authorities across China are trying to try stem the spread of the country's worst COVID-19 outbreak in two years, putting millions of people in lockdown, curbing transport and shutting factories. 
Some of the toughest measures have been applied in the key manufacturing hubs of Shenzhen, Dongguan and Changchun, as well as the Chinese financial centre of Shanghai, which is home to the world's busiest container port.
Fabien Gaussorgues, who provides contract manufacturing services from a factory in Dongguan, said he was struggling to procure parts needed for electric scooters, warehouse robots and electric toys because of the shutdowns. 
""It's not critical yet but it's getting more difficult every day,"" Gaussorgues said. ""Suppliers in Shenzhen cannot produce, so they're not delivering goods. So next week we don't have material for production,"" he added. 
Lens Technology, which supplies lenses and glass material to customers such as Apple, said on Monday the production and delivery of some products would be impacted after it suspended work at its Dongguan plant.
And Netac Technology, which makes portable hard drives and USB flash drives, similarly warned of shipment delays as its factory in Shenzhen had to stop work. 
While major ports in Shenzhen and Shanghai said they were operating normally, logistic providers said there were trucking delays due to road and testing restrictions and some firms in Shenzhen had stopped their warehouses from accepting deliveries. 
Refinitiv data showed increased container congestion at key Chinese shipping hubs, with the number of vessels awaiting docking in the outer anchorages of the Yangtze Estuary, Pearl River Delta, Zhoushan and Qingdao port more than double the average of March 2021. 
Chinese share prices, which plunged on Monday, slumped to close at 21-month lows on Tuesday as surging coronavirus cases threatened the outlook for the world's second-largest economy. 
Other companies which have warned that the COVID-19 curbs are impacting their businesses include Chinese automaker BYD, KFC operator Yum China, iPhone assembler Foxconn, Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p). 
BYD, headquartered in Shenzhen where most companies have been told to ask staff to work from home, said that there had been some impact on production at its site. 
""We are actively coordinating a response and carrying out epidemic prevention and control,"" BYD said.

Yum, operator of KFC and Pizza Hut in China, said on Monday during an earnings briefing that its operations had been significantly impacted by the outbreaks, and same-store sales fell 20% year-on-year in the first two weeks of March. 
""It's a very tough month for every food service retailer in China,"" a source at a large Western catering chain told Reuters.

Israel's flag carrier will pay interest of 5.5% to 7% in the loan, in which final details still need to be worked out, it said in a regulatory filing in Tel Aviv.
El Al will put up its Matmid frequent flier club as collateral for the loan. Phoenix will have an option to buy 25% of Matmid by the end of 2027.
Sales plummeted at El Al amid restrictions imposed during the pandemic to curb the spread of COVID-19. Israel only recently opened its borders to foreign tourists, allowing El Al to narrow its net loss in the fourth quarter to $110 million from $140 million a year earlier.

The loan is part of a government bailout package, in which El Al was forced to lay off one-third if of its workforce and trim its fleet. The state, which gave El Al a $210 million aid package last year, also required El Al to inject more cash into the airline, either by selling a stake in Matmid or securing a loan using Matmid as collateral.
The two parties have 90 days to reach a final loan agreement and El Al is restricted from taking out additional loans.

The majority of investors managing about $1 trillion in assets polled between March 4 and 10 now expect an equity bear market in 2022 and allocations to global equities have dropped to their lowest levels since May 2020. 
Cash levels among investors rose to nearly 6% while allocations to commodities soared to a record 33%. Hedge funds net exposure to stock markets is at its lowest level since April 2020, according to the survey. 
The top crowded trade is long oil/commodities, the U.S. investment bank said in the note, with long technology stocks and long ESG ranked second and third respectively. Nearly half of the investors surveyed expect oil will produce the best returns in 2022.
The European edition of the monthly fund manager survey made for grim reading with investors slashing their growth outlook for Europe in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
A net 69% of respondents expect the European economy to weaken over the coming year, the highest share since 2011. The 81 percentage point swing from February's net 12% who still expected to see growth marks the biggest month-on-month drop since BoFA's records began in 1994.
In response to the darkening growth outlook, about 61% of investors think the European market has peaked for this cycle, up from 22% in the previous edition of the survey. 
Investors have also slightly increased their expectations for the number of rate hikes from the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2022 even as liquidity conditions have worsened considerably to their lowest since the coronavirus pandemic hit financial markets in March and April 2020.

""This is notable because central banks have historically been much less inclined to hike when liquidity conditions are very poor,"" BofA said.
A net 44% of European investors expect European inflation to rise over the next twelve months, while last month 38% expected lower inflation. At a global level, a net 5% of investors think global inflation will decline, down from a 13-year high of 56% last month, BoFA said.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - H&M reported a 23% rise in first quarter sales on Tuesday, which was in line with market expectations, as the world's second-biggest fashion retailer attempts to build on its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Shares in Sweden's H&M, which did not give any comment in its statement, were down 3% in early trade as analysts focused on the potential impact of the Ukraine crisis on its business in Central and Eastern Europe and wider global repurcussions. 
Net sales in H&M's fiscal first quarter from December through February, its seasonally slowest, were up by 18% in local currency terms, at 49.2 billion crowns ($5.13 billion), compared to an average forecast from analysts polled by Refinitiv of 49.1 billion crowns. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note the figures implied a slowdown in local-currency sales growth to around 14% in February, from the around 20% flagged previously for December-January.
H&M earlier this month temporarily closed its stores in Russia, which last quarter accounted for 4% of group sales, joining a growing list of international companies shunning the country over its invasion of Ukraine.
RBC analyst Richard Chamberlain said he had cut profit estimates for H&M for this year and next by around 10%, pointing to the Russia store closures but also the fact Central and Eastern Europe account for some 12% of group sales.
Less than a month before Russia invaded Ukraine, H&M had drawn a line under the pandemic, and several tough years before that, reporting a jump in profit and saying it was hiking investments with the aim of doubling sales by 2030.
Credit Suisse analysts noted that while Russia accounts for a small share of H&M's sales, the Ukraine crisis could result in a material effect on global disposable income and demand. 
Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"", has proposed nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave in the wake of economic sanctions.

H&M will publish its full quarterly earnings report on March 31. Its biggest rival  Inditex  (MC:ITX), the owner of Zara, is due to report quarterly results on March 16.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said talks have failed to resolve a bitter dispute over Future Retail stores and accused both it and Reliance Industries of fraud in Indian newspaper ads on Tuesday.
The U.S. e-commerce giant has been contesting a $3.4 billion sale of Future Group's retail assets to the Reliance conglomerate that was announced in 2020, and the case is currently before the Indian Supreme Court.
""I regret to say that we made efforts but I think nothing is possible by way of resolution,"" Amazon's lawyer Gopal Subramanium told the court. ""The conversation is over.""
Reliance, also India's biggest retailer, stunned Amazon when it began taking over prized real estate on Feb.25 with its staff suddenly showing up at many of Future's biggest stores to assume control, sources have told Reuters.
In earlier legal wrangling, Amazon had managed to block the sale of the retail assets.
But Reliance's sudden possession of more than 900 Future stores have landed what some analysts are calling a coup de grace that spoils Amazon's chances of untangling the transfer of Future's assets.
After the first seizures of stores, Amazon proposed talks separate from the Supreme Court hearing to resolve the issue but on Tuesday, lawyers for both Amazon and Future agreed those negotiations had collapsed.
Amazon had at the Supreme Court been seeking to return the legal dispute to arbitration in Singapore after Future had successfully obtained an Indian court order to stay those proceedings. On Tuesday, Future said it was not opposed to arbitration in Singapore.
Earlier in the day, Amazon had run large ads in leading Indian newspapers headlined ""PUBLIC NOTICE"" and saying that actions taken by Reliance and Future ""have been done in a clandestine manner by playing a fraud on the constitutional courts in India.""
Future lawyer Harish Salve told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that the company did not transfer the stores to Reliance voluntarily. 
Future has said in filings this month that it could not pay rent at many outlets given its distressed financial situation and that Reliance, which had taken over many of its leases, had issued it with termination notices.
Reliance has not responded to a Reuters request for comment. 

The newspaper ads were aimed at alerting all stakeholders, including Future's lenders, that the transfer of assets to Reliance is legally prohibited, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter. The source was not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified.

Toyota said it would suspend production on one line at a factory for eight weekdays starting March 22 through the end of the month. That is in addition to the suspension of domestic production at two factories announced last month. 
Production of about 14,000 Noah and Voxy minivans would be affected by the latest suspension, a Toyota spokesperson said.
Last week, Toyota said it would lower production for three months starting April to ease the strain on suppliers, which were struggling with the shortages of chips and other parts.
The news follows Toyota's announcement on Monday that it would halt production at its joint venture plant with FAW Group in the city of Changchun, China, due to fresh COVID-19 curbs. 
Despite the cuts, Toyota would maintain its 8.5 million vehicle production target for the year, the spokesperson said.
A global chip shortage has plagued companies from smartphone makers to consumer electronics firms and car makers, forcing companies including Toyota to repeatedly cut production even as raw material costs rise.
U.S. EV maker Rivian Automotive warned last week that supply-chain issues could force it to cut planned production by half this year. 
German car maker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said on Tuesday it sold 2 million fewer cars than planned last year due to the chip crunch and warned that ongoing supply bottlenecks, high commodity prices and the Russia-Ukraine conflict could hit growth in 2022.

Investing.com -- European stock markets opened lower on Tuesday as a fresh round of EU sanctions, a rebound in Covid-19 cases and more signs of red-hot inflation all weighed on sentiment. 
By 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), The Euro Stoxx 50 was down 53 points or 1.4% while the broader Stoxx 600 Index was down by a similar amount. Germany was the biggest loser among major markets, the DAX losing 1.3%, while Italy's FTSE MIB outperformed with a drop of only 0.8%.
Among individual stocks, Swedish retailer H & M (ST:HMb) fell 3.1% despite reporting in-line first-quarter sales growth of 23%, while U.K.-based tobacco giant Imperial Brands (LON:IMB) fell 1.1% after it trimmed its profit forecast due to the exit from Russia that it announced last week. 
Overnight, the EU agreed to widened its sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, imposing a ban on exports of luxury goods and cars worth over 50,000 euros. The bloc still shied away from an immediate ban on purchases of Russian energy exports, which are opposed by Germany and some others due to the lack of short-term alternatives. 
The luxury sector underperformed on the news: LVMH (PA:LVMH) stock fell 2.4% while Moncler (MI:MONC) fell over 3%.
The euro, however, rose 0.6% against the dollar to $1.1058, supported by better-than-expected industrial production and retail sales data out of China for February. The numbers suggested that the second-most important export market for European businesses is still holding up, although the numbers have been made somewhat obsolete by the lockdowns imposed this week as China battles to contain the Covid-19 virus. The country has locked down both the manufacturing center of Shenzhen and the whole province of Jilin in northeastern China, keeping some 45 million people at home in the biggest lockdowns in over two years.
The dollar, which eased across the board against developed-market currencies in early trading, hit a two-month high against the yuan on fears of an imminent economic slowdown there. 
Europe itself is struggling with a revival of the virus - the BA.2 strain of the Omicron variant. After rushing to drop unpopular public health measures in recent weeks, German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach warned that new infections would likely reach a new all-time high in Europe's largest economy this week. However, the more mild nature of the new dominant strain is ensuring that hospital admissions are still remaining well below previous record highs.
Earlier, the U.K. reported better-than-expected labor market data for February, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.9%, below its pre-pandemic level. Average earnings also outstripped expectations, cementing fears of another interest rate hike from the Bank of England this week. If confirmed, that would be a third hike in as many meetings from the BoE. In the Eurozone, French data showed consumer inflation to be still running well ahead of target at 4.2% on the year in February.
Eurozone industrial production data and the German ZEW Economic Sentiment Index are due later, but the main event on the data calendar will be the release of U.S. producer price inflation at 8:30 AM ET."
997,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 04:15AM ET</span>",Marketmind: More red lines ahead,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao
It was exactly two years ago on March 15 2020 that the U.S. Federal Reserve, in the words of its boss Jerome Powell, ""crossed a lot of red lines that had not been crossed before.""
In the face of a pandemic that threatened recession on a scale not seen since the 1930s, Powell cut interest rates to zero, announced huge asset purchases to deflect bond market stress and opened dollar supply lines for other central banks.
Now, the Fed is about to throw its pandemic emergency measures into reverse. Later on Tuesday, it starts a two-day meeting that should deliver a 25 basis-point rate rise and could signal how far and fast policy tightening might go. 
The challenges, while less monumental than in 2020, are nonetheless daunting. A war is raging, sending food and fuel prices soaring. That could exacerbate inflation, already more than three times the Fed's target; a double-digit factory inflation print is expected on Tuesday. 
A sharp rise in Treasury yields and futures reflect expectations of aggressive policy-tightening ahead, yet stamping on inflation rather than economic growth will be no easy task .
On the other side of the world, China's central bank defied rate cut expectations, perhaps having assessed forecast-beating industrial and retail data. With COVID cases on the rise, and possibly, more lockdowns to come, stocks plunged 4.5% with foreigners especially heading for the exit.
And the prospect of more regulatory hurdles sent Hong Kong tech stocks down as much as 11% in its biggest intraday fall ever.
Finally Europe. Tuesday's UK data showing unemployment falling below pre-pandemic rates and wage gains means a Bank of England rate hike on Thursday is a done deal. A tad later, Germany's March ZEW reading may show a dip, reflecting the confidence hit inflicted by the war. 
And finally, on the Ukraine-Russia front, talks are to continue after Monday discussions yielded no progress. U.S., and European equities are downbeat but oil prices declined further to two-week lows. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Tuesday: 
Australia central bank patient on policy despite inflation shock
German Zew index
Eurozone industrial output

ECB President Christine Lagarde, board members Luis de Guindos and Andrea Enria speak

999,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 03:41AM ET</span>",Boeing 737 MAX jet headed toward China completion plant - sources,"By Stella Qiu and Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) -A Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX jet that took off from Seattle on Monday is en route to the manufacturer's completion plant in China, two industry sources said, in a sign the model is closer to returning to commercial flights there after a three-year grounding.
Flight tracking websites showed the plane, painted in the livery of Shanghai Airlines - a subsidiary of China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) - had landed in Hawaii. 
The source, who was not authorised to speak publicly, said it was the first fuel stop of a multi-day journey.
The Zhoushan plant, used for installing interiors before delivery, opened in December 2018, a few months before a second fatal MAX crash led China to ground the model. 
""If this points to a delivery, it will be the first MAX delivery to China since March 2019, which is material as the country historically has represented 17% of deliveries,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients.
China, the first country to ground the MAX, is the only major global market where the aircraft is still not in commercial service, and its return is taking longer than expected at a time when domestic demand is declining as COVID-19 cases rise.
China's aviation regulator in early December provided airlines with a list of fixes required before its return to commercial flying, which it predicted would occur by the beginning of this year.
So far, however, there have been only test flights, and deliveries of more than 140 MAX jets already built for Chinese customers that are at Boeing sites in the United States have been delayed as a result, one of the industry sources told Reuters.
Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said on Jan. 26 that his company was getting ready to deliver those planes as early as the first quarter, once the fleet already in China returned to service.
The industry source said the initial plan was to deliver all 140-plus planes in 2022, but that was doubtful because the Zhoushan plant lacks capacity and many of the planes still required Chinese approvals.
Boeing declined to comment on the MAX flight to Zhoushan.
The planemaker said in a statement that it continued to work with regulators and customers on the MAX return to service worldwide.
Chinese airlines are in no rush to bring back the MAX because of falling domestic demand amid the biggest COVID-19 outbreaks in two years, three other people familiar with the matter told Reuters on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly.
""There is less urgency to add capacity now,"" one of those people said.

China Southern Airlines is among the Chinese airlines closest to returning the plane to commercial service and might be the first to do so, the person said.
China Southern did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

""What matters is that French companies implement sanctions,"" Attal told France 2 television, when asked about TotalEnergies, which is under pressure from activist investors and NGOs to exit Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
A fourth package of EU sanctions decided on Monday called for no new investments in Russia, which was what TotalEnergies had already decided to do, Attal added.
TotalEnergies has condemned Russia's aggression against Ukraine and has suspended new investments in the country but has not followed the example of British peers BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) which are withdrawing from Russia.
Activist investor Clearway Capital has written to the board of TotalEnergies calling on it to exit its Russian operations in light of the war in Ukraine or face a vote on the issue at its next shareholder meeting.

Two leading French NGOs also plan to take legal action against TotalEnergies over possible human rights abuses unless it cuts its business ties with Russia, they said in a letter to the energy major's CEO. [L5N2VH4W9]

1003,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 02:56AM ET</span>","With Toyota as partner, Mazda hopes to jump-start U.S. market","By Satoshi Sugiyama and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - A decade after Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY)'s cars disappeared from Ford Motor (NYSE:F)'s factory floors in Michigan, the Japanese automaker is once again building in the United States - this time with compatriot  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM). 
When the first Mazda CX-50 crossovers rolled off the assembly line at the joint Alabama plant in January, they were packed with efficiencies hammered out by the two automakers, both known for their cost-cutting smarts and manufacturing prowess.
For Mazda, restarting local production with help from Toyota's deep local knowledge and reputation for reliability is the game-changer it hopes will jump-start sales in the world's second-biggest market.
""It's a huge advantage for us to be able to learn from Toyota's vast experience in the United States,"" Masashi Aihara, head of Mazda Toyota Manufacturing U.S.A. (MTM), told Reuters in an interview last week.
Although the 50-50 venture might seem like a David-and-Goliath partnership, it also provides a glimpse into how Toyota aims to glean fresh skills from its growing number of smaller partners. 
As competition heats up in the industry - not least from prospective new entrants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) Group - Toyota has taken minority stakes in Mazda as well as small-car maker Suzuki Motor and all-wheel-drive specialist Subaru (OTC:FUJHY) Corp in recent years.
Aihara, a 38-year veteran of Mazda, said his selection to lead the $2.3 billion, 300,000-units-a-year factory was evidence that the learning was mutual.
""Under President (Akio) Toyoda, Toyota is constantly looking to change the way it does things, and I think (by putting me in this position) he was saying, 'If there's something to be learned from Mazda, learn it.'""
 BEST  (NYSE:BEST) PRACTICES
The Huntsville, Alabama factory, which opened last year and is designed to add electric vehicles in future, contains many firsts for Mazda.
MTM tows components from on-site suppliers on linked-up tractors, saving time on loading and unloading from trucks. 
The order in which the vehicles are assembled was also streamlined and machinery standardised as much as possible so Mazda and Toyota cars could eventually be built on the same line.
""There were times when we both realised that we were doing things a certain way purely out of habit,"" Aihara said. ""And in some cases, we came up with a hybrid method bringing in techniques from both sides. That's something we wouldn't be able to do at Mazda proper."" 
The operation hasn't been without its hitches. 
A tight labour market has meant the plant is still 900 workers short of the targeted 4,000, keeping it running at one shift instead of two. Mazda wants to boost U.S. sales by about a third to 450,000 by the middle of the decade.

An early plan to train six teams at Mazda and Toyota factories in Japan was derailed by COVID-19, the second team forced to cut their trip short. Still, Toyota's U.S. footprint paid off there too: Kentucky and other local plants helped complete training for the rest, Aihara said.
""Ultimately, the No. 1 mission for this factory is to contribute to the growth of our U.S. business,"" he said.

1005,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2022 01:40AM ET</span>","Analysis - Investors see risks spiking, fear market-wide liquidity crunch","By Davide Barbuscia
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wild swings in asset prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine are prompting some investors to pare risk in their portfolios, fearing that the type of volatility seen in commodities in recent weeks could hit other markets.
At issue is liquidity – or the ease at which investors can buy or sell an asset without affecting its price. While episodes of low liquidity have contributed to sharp gyrations across markets over the last decade, signs of stress have become more plentiful in the last few weeks, exacerbated by everything from sanctions against Russia to expected central bank tightening.
Should liquidity continue to deteriorate throughout markets, investors worry that other assets could be subject to the kind of violent price swings that have wracked commodities this month - which have included a one-day doubling in nickel prices and a surge in oil to 14-year highs. 
""It isn't always clear where the contagion risks lie,"" said Frances Donald, Global Chief Economist at Manulife Investment Management. ""This is why liquidity needs to be monitored, not just daily, but hourly at this point, for signs of challenges.""
Financial indicators are showing increasing signs of stress throughout markets. 
The so-called FRA-OIS spread, which measures the gap between the U.S. three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate was recently at its highest level since May 2020, while another closely-watched short-term funding stress gauge, the spread between the U.S. three-month Libor and the overnight index swap rate was at a similar high. Volatility in stocks, currencies and U.S. Treasury yields has also spiked.
In another potential red flag,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) on Monday suspended sales of two products linked to crude oil and market volatility, which some saw as a sign of lack of liquidity.
Among the assets investors have been cutting are emerging markets bonds, which saw $3.54 billion in net outflows last week, the biggest reduction since April 2020. Treasuries, meanwhile, saw some $5.4 billion in inflows in the past nine weeks, according to BofA Global Research. 
Mike Vogelzang, Chief Investment Officer at CAPTRUST in Boston, said his firm had taken ""aggressive action"" in response to the Ukraine crisis to reduce the risk profile of its portfolios. That included cutting equity exposure and selling mortgages and a number of corporate bonds, replacing them with highly liquid short-term U.S. Treasuries. 
""We're worried about a potential liquidity scare on a global stage,"" he said. ""We were significantly underweight U.S. Treasuries to our benchmarks for years now, and so we really filled that bucket up and reduced the illiquidity potential in our portfolios.""
Vogelzang said events like last week's spike in nickel prices – which came as one of the world's top producers bought large amounts of nickel to cover bets on falling prices and cover costly margin calls - indicate the potential for ""liquidity panic"" in markets.
Investors also highlighted counterparty risk, referring to the probability of defaults in contractual obligations linked, in this case, to an underlying commodity. In a rare warning on Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission said concentrated positions of prime brokerage counterparties pose particular concerns.
Bill Campbell, Global Bond Portfolio Manager at DoubleLine is concerned about the impact the Ukraine crisis is having on a ""systemically important"" part of global supply chains that affects not only energy prices but also vital commodities such as wheat, of which both Ukraine and Russia are major producers.
Campbell has reduced exposure to Eastern European countries in his portfolios and is looking to differentiate investment between commodity importing and commodity exporting countries to reduce risk. 
""We need to become more comfortable that this crisis is going to be contained to the region,"" he said. 

Ryan O'Malley, a fixed income portfolio manager at Sage Advisory said the conflict had accelerated liquidity concerns in the corporate credit market, pushing him to shift his portfolio increasingly towards more liquid assets such as Treasuries.
""We're trying to get more liquid,"" O'Malley said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian refining giant Reliance Industries has acquired the assets of battery maker Lithium Werks for $61 million, its second such deal in less than three months, as it makes a bigger push towards clean energy and transport.
Reliance's investment in Lithium Werks, which manufactures lithium iron phosphate batteries that are mainly used in electric vehicles (EVs), includes funding for future growth, the company said late on Monday. 
The assets, acquired through its subsidiary Reliance New Energy, include Lithium Werks' portfolio of about 219 patents, a manufacturing facility in China, key business contracts and existing employees, it said.
The deal comes as Reliance looks to cut dependence on its mainstay oil-to-chemicals business, with plans to invest $10 billion in clean energy projects to boost its green credentials and meet its goal of net zero carbon by 2035.
Reliance agreed in December to buy Faradion, a UK-based sodium-ion battery company, for an enterprise value of 100 million pounds ($130 million). The two companies will give Reliance access to technology that will be key in its plan to manufacture batteries and battery systems in India. 
""Along with Faradion, Lithium Werks will enable us to accelerate our vision of establishing India at the core of developments in global battery chemistries,"" Reliance's owner, billionaire Mukesh Ambani said in the statement.
It will allow Reliance to provide ""a high-performance supply chain"" to the growing Indian EV and energy storage markets, he added.

India is offering incentives of up to $6 billion to companies to build EVs and batteries locally as the government looks to establish a domestic supply chain for clean transport and renewable energy.

The eurobonds in question, maturing in 2023 and 2043, were both last trading at 20 cents on the dollar or lower and are among the first to have scheduled payments after Russia was hit by sanctions related to its invasion of Ukraine.
The restrictions meant it was unclear whether Russia would be able, or willing, to make the payments.

""And today, on Monday, we prepared a payment document in foreign currency and will give an order to foreign banks to execute this payment.

Reuters could not immediately confirm with bond holders that the payment was under way.
Russia has 15 international bonds with a face value of around $40 billion outstanding. Around half of the bonds are held by foreign investors.

The one-time options grant extends over seven years, at strike prices of $35.65 or greater, according to a Discovery spokesman, which means Zaslav would receive a payout only after fueling a substantial surge in the share price. Discovery's stock closed Monday at $23.88.

Zaslav negotiated an extension of his employment contract in May, after Discovery announced its $43 billion acquisition of AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia. The executive, who will lead the new Warner Bros Discovery, agreed to remain through December 2027. 
The deal is on track to close in the second quarter this year. Last month, it passed the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust review, clearing another key hurdle toward finishing the deal.

U.S. District Judge Ed Kinkeade said he hoped to issue a written ruling in a matter of days. 
ZTE is on probation from its guilty plea in a case tied to illegally shipping American technology to Iran. Kinkeade summoned the company to his courtroom over the possible violation involving an alleged conspiracy to commit visa fraud. 
ZTE's shares declined after word of the hearing surfaced about a week ago, falling more than 12% last week in Hong Kong and then slipping 7% further on Monday.
Chang and Jianjun Yu, a former ZTE research director in New Jersey, are accused of conspiring to bring Chinese nationals to the United States to conduct research at ZTE between at least 2014 and 2018, according to an indictment unsealed in March 2021. 
The Chinese nationals were in the United States on J-1 visas, which are intended for work and study at sponsoring institutions like Georgia Tech.
During his testimony, the FBI's Wondergem said he checked the door logs for the Georgia Tech lab and produced leases for apartments in Morristown. 
On cross-examination by Dallas lawyer Scott Barnard, who represents ZTE, Wondergem acknowledged that the sponsor of the J-1 visas - Georgia Tech, not ZTE - was responsible for the accuracy of the visa applications and that ""research scholars"" are permitted to work at more than one location.
Wondergem also said that, despite years of investigation in the Georgia Tech case, neither ZTE nor a U.S. subsidiary was indicted.
No other witnesses were called at the hearing.
In closing arguments, Robert Buehler, a lawyer for ZTE, said Yu was a professor at Shanghai's Fudan University and, in many cases, recommended former students to Georgia Tech. He described their work at ZTE as an ""informal internship.""
Buehler also argued that Georgia Tech was responsible for the visas and for the conduct of scientists and engineers in the United States.
""If anyone here should have done more, it was Georgia Tech,"" Buehler said.
De la Garza argued that Yu and Chang conspired to use J-1 visas for people to work at ZTE because it was a ""cheaper, faster, easier way"" to get foreign nationals into the United States. 

""It's a sham,"" de la Garza said. 
Chang has pleaded not guilty. A lawyer for Chang, Robert Fisher, declined to comment. Yu's status is unclear. ZTE said he left the company in 2019.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 07:16PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO Scharf's 2021 compensation up by 20% at $24.5 million,"(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf's total compensation for 2021 was $24.5 million, up nearly 20% from a year ago, the Wall Street bank disclosed in a regulatory filing on Monday.
Scharf's compensation consisted of $2.5 million in base salary, a $5.4 million cash bonus, $10.8 million in performance shares awards and $5.8 million in restricted share rights, the filing showed.
The top boss had earned $20.3 million in 2020, a 12% drop from the previous year.
Scharf took over the reins at Wells Fargo in 2019, seeking to turn around the fortunes of the major Wall Street bank which has been in regulators' penalty box since 2016 when details emerged about millions of phony accounts employees had created in customers’ names without their permission, to hit sales targets. 

After a pandemic-induced slump in 2020, Wells Fargo recovered last year, with the bank's shares jumping nearly 59% in 2021.
By comparison, Wall Street peer JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) paid top boss Jamie Dimon $34.5 million for 2021, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) Inc’s CEO Jane Fraser was paid $22.5 million.

In a securities filing, the Warren Buffet-backed star of Latin America's fintechs said the change does not have a significant impact on its ""business model or our ability to grow.""
Nubank's U.S.-listed shares were up nearly 2% at $6.04 after market. Despite Monday's bump, however, Nubank's shares have lost nearly 37% so far this year, in line with souring investor sentiment in the broader tech market.

On Friday, Brazil's central bank announced tougher rules for fintechs, subjecting payment institutions to regulations based on their size and complexity, while also raising standards for required capital.
The new framework, which will start taking effect in January 2023 with full implementation by January 2025, will extend the proportionality of regulatory requirements currently used for conglomerates of financial institutions to include financial conglomerates led by payment institutions.

1014,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 06:32PM ET</span>",Amazon may be days away from closing deal to buy film studio MGM,"WASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) could be days away from closing its deal to buy MGM, the fabled studio behind ""Rocky"" and ""James Bond,"" as a mid-March deadline for regulators to challenge the online retailer's merger plan approaches.
Antitrust agencies in the United States and Europe both have to decide if Amazon's $8.5 billion deal for the nearly century-old studio breaks antitrust law. Amazon announced the transaction in May 2021, saying it offered a trove of content for the company to develop and draw consumers to its Prime fast-shipping and streaming club.
In Europe, EU antitrust regulators are set to clear the planned acquisition without conditions, according to people familiar with the matter. They have a March 15 deadline to act.
Shortly after that, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is approaching its own deadline for making a decision on whether the deal violates antitrust law. The FTC's deadline is in mid-March, at least a day after the European Commission's deadline, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The online retailer substantially complied with the FTC's requests for information about the deal, which started the clock for the FTC to make a decision, the Wall Street Journal previously reported.
Exactly when Amazon might close the deal, subject to whether or not the FTC attempts to stop the MGM merger, was unclear.
The FTC, whose Chair Lina Khan gained internet fame with a law review article entitled ""Amazon's Antitrust Paradox,"" has a broader antitrust probe open into Amazon as part of government antitrust investigations begun under the Trump administration into the four big tech platforms, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

If Amazon wins approval, the online retailer and cloud-computing giant would be able to ramp up competition with streaming rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney +. 
MGM would bolster Amazon Prime Video's offering with more than 4,000 film titles, as well as this year's Oscar-nominated ""Licorice Pizza"" and a long list of television shows.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a rare public warning, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday told broker-dealers and other market participants to ""remain vigilant to market and counterparty risk"" amid heightened volatility and global uncertainties. 
The agency urged broker-dealers to closely monitor counterparty risk, collect ""margin"" or collateral from counterparties to ""the fullest extent possible,"" and stress test their positions. 
Global stock and commodities markets have been unusually volatile in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a slew of Western retaliatory sanctions on Russia's financial system and its oil exports.
Wild swings in the prices of oil, metals and other raw materials last week generated more margin calls at clearing houses and trading firms, forcing counterparties out of the money to stump up liquid collateral they must pledge to secure their trades.
Sudden, large margin calls can put financial stress on counterparties that do not hold sufficiently liquid assets. 
""Staff urges broker-dealers to seek sufficient information to determine counterparties’ aggregate positions in any markets that may experience liquidity concerns and work with the counterparties to mitigate risk,"" the SEC said. 

Regulators are more sensitive to issues with broker dealers’ counterparty risk management controls after several were left nursing around $10 billion in losses last year on derivative trades they had inked with New York family office Archegos. 
On Monday, the SEC said that ""concentrated positions"" among prime broker counterparties ""pose particular concerns"" and that brokers should gather data to determine counterparties’ aggregate exposure, the SEC said

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) -China's efforts to curb its largest COVID-19 outbreak in two years has forced companies from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier Foxconn to automakers Toyota and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) to suspend some operations, raising concerns over supply chain disruptions. 
Multiple Chinese provinces and cities have tightened restrictions in line with Beijing's zero-tolerance goal of suppressing contagion as quickly as possible, among them the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen.
Shenzhen, China's Silicon Valley, is carrying out mass testing after dozens of new local cases were recorded. Officials have suspended public transport and urged people to work at home this week as much as possible.
White House press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Monday that the Biden Administration was monitoring the lockdown of the tech hub ""incredibly closely."" 
""What we're looking at is of course ... the impact on some of these ports around the impacted areas of China,"" she said in a Monday afternoon briefing. 
China has reported more local symptomatic COVID-19 cases so far this year than it recorded in all of 2021. 
Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said its Shenzhen operations would be suspended until further notice, adding it would deploy backup plants to reduce disruption. 
Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Foxconn and its subsidiaries' operations in Shenzhen would be suspended for the first half of the week. 
One of the people said the government was allowing companies to operate if they could create a ""closed management"" system where employees would live and work in a bubble. Such a system was in place during the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Other Taiwan companies which said they had suspended Shenzhen operations included chip substrate and printed circuit board maker Unimicron Technology Corp, which also supplies Apple and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and flexible printed circuit board maker Sunflex Technology Co Ltd.
Sunflex said its plant would be closed until Sunday.
Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Intel declined to comment. 
Paul Weedman, who runs manufacturing consultancy Victure Industrial Co., Ltd in Shenzhen, warned that the restrictions were having a ripple effect beyond Shenzhen to the wider Guangdong province. Production for some of his customers' orders have been suspended, and many factory visits cancelled, he said. 
""Imagine you have a factory of 100 people and all of a sudden you can’t do anything - you can’t fulfil your existing orders, you can’t accept new orders. The impact is not 2 or 3 weeks, but 3-6 months.""
Shenzhen's Yantian International Container Terminal (YICT), one of China's busiest ports, said in a WeChat statement it was operating normally, although two companies with warehouses at the port said they needed to temporarily suspend operations. 
CHANGCHUN LOCKDOWN
Other cities have enacted restrictions to varying extents. Officials have locked down Changchun city, the capital of northeastern Jilin province, shut schools in the financial hub of Shanghai and suspended public transport in the manufacturing centre of Dongguan. 
Toyota said on Monday its joint venture with China's FAW Group had suspended production in Changchun, while its Tianjin city operations remained unaffected. 
Volkswagen, which also has a joint venture with FAW, said it had suspended production at its vehicle and component plants from Monday to Wednesday. FAW, which is headquartered in Changchun, did not respond to a request for comment. 

A factory owner in Dongguan, who gave his surname as Lau, said his plant was forced to shut down from Sunday until Tuesday. They were also experiencing some issues in obtaining materials from suppliers due to the virus restrictions, he added. 
""Hopefully they will let us carry on with the production soon,"" he said. ""There's not much we can do. The whole world has moved on, except for China. They should just let go of the zero-COVID strategy.""

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) allowed three pork plants to increase processing line speeds this month as part of a trial program, reviving a policy that started under the Trump administration.
The approvals will allow meat companies to boost pork production when there are ample supplies of hogs. They also renew concerns about worker injuries and food safety at meat plants.
The USDA said it approved faster line speeds at Clemens Food Group in Hatfield, Pennsylvania; Quality Pork Processors in Austin, Minnesota; and Wholestone Farms Cooperative in Fremont, Nebraska. The companies did not respond to requests for comment. 
Nine plants were eligible to apply for the trial program because they were previously able to accelerate processing under the Trump-era rule.
Last year, a U.S. judge invalidated the 2019 rule after the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Union sued the USDA over safety concerns for workers running faster slaughter lines.
The ruling restricted plants to processing 1,106 hogs per hour.
Line speeds are ""unique"" for plants approved for the trial program, the USDA told Reuters on Monday. The agency declined to provide the specific limits.
Plants approved for the trial program can operate at faster speeds for up to a year and are supposed to collect data on how line speeds affect workers.
The UFCW is comfortable with the program in plants it represents because companies agreed to increase staffing when line speeds accelerate to ensure safety, said Mark Lauritsen, the union's international vice president for meatpacking. The union represents workers at Quality Pork Processors and Wholestone Farms.
The Biden administration has criticized the meat industry for being too concentrated and has tried to incentivize new, smaller meatpacking plants to increase output and lower meat prices.

New York (Reuters) - Oil prices fell and European stocks rose on Monday as investors weighed positive comments from ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine, while U.S. Treasury yields hit two-and-a-half year highs on expectations of a first U.S. rate hike.
U.S. stocks were mostly lower as investors remained cautious on the Ukraine conflict, with the market focus on this week's Federal Reserve meeting.
Russian and Ukrainian officials gave their most upbeat assessments on Sunday of progress in their talks to end the conflict, with some delegates saying draft agreements could be reached within days.
European stocks closed higher on the tentative hopes of progress in the peace talks, while oil prices retreated to their lowest in two weeks on the prospects of increased global supplies.

Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields rose to 2.1419%, the highest since July 2019.
""The Fed is expected to hike rates by 25 basis points (this week) and you're seeing the 10-yields rise, which is positive from a yield curve perspective and implies the flattening may be coming to an end. We may avoid an inversion and a recession in the near term,"" Hayes said.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.2% while the MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.74%. Overnight in Asia, the Nikkei 225 index closed up 0.58%.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department on Monday barred regional carrier  SkyWest  (NASDAQ:SKYW) Inc from ending service to 29 locales until replacement carriers can be found under the government's subsidy program to provide air service to smaller communities.
SkyWest provides regional service for key airlines such as United Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL). SkyWest operates the 29 routes under the United Express name providing regional service for United Airlines.
SkyWest last week announced plans to end service to the 29 communities under the Essential Air Service subsidies program effective on June 8, saying ""the pilot staffing challenges across the airline industry preclude"" the carrier from continuing service.
The Transportation Department said SkyWest cannot terminate service through July 8 ""and for additional 30-day periods as necessary"" in the event federal officials do not secure another air carrier to provide service under the program at any of the 29 communities.
Some of the communities with United Express flights operated by SkyWest being cut include: Cape Girardeau, Joplin and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri; Decatur, Illinois; Clarksburg and Greenbrier/Lewisburg, West Virginia; and Fort Dodge, Mason City and Sioux City, Iowa. Some others include: Muskegon and Houghton/Hancock, Michigan; Hattiesburg/Laurel, Mississippi; Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Kearney, Scottsbluff and North Platte, Nebraska; Salina, Liberal, Hays and Dodge City, Kansas; Eau Claire, Wisconsin; and Victoria, Texas. 
Each route typically has a separate contract. Such contracts. Each contract generally has around $3 million in annual government subsidies.
SkyWest said it is ""eager to work with officials toward solutions that would enable us to reconnect these communities to the National Air Transportation System in the future, and we are committed to remaining flexible and adjusting our plans if the situation improves more quickly than currently expected.""

The Transportation Department said it wants other carriers to file proposals no later than April 11 to offer flights to replace the canceled service.
United Airlines Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told Congress in December the airline had nearly 100 regional airplanes effectively grounded ""because there's not enough pilots to fly them. ... The country is going to need thousands of pilots.""

1021,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 05:31PM ET</span>",Your connected car knows you. The tussle for that data's hitting high gear,"By Nick Carey
LONDON (Reuters) - Where you go. What you pass. Where you stop. What you listen to. What you watch. Your good habits. Your bad habits. 
Companies in Europe and beyond are vying for control of the crown jewels of the connected car era: your vehicle's data. 
The contest is entering a pivotal phase as EU regulators look to hammer out the world's first laws for the ballooning industry around web-enabled vehicles, pitting carmakers against a coalition of insurers, leasing companies and repair shops.
European Commission sources said the EU executive should launch an industry consultation on in-vehicle data this week which could lead to legislation later this year - the first of its kind globally. 
Many companies view data as the gold of the new wired world, though for some it's more akin to air or water.
""If you don't have access to data in the future, eventually you'll be squeezed out,"" says Tim Albertsen, CEO of ALD, Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY)'s car leasing division, which commands millions of vehicles. 
""You'll not be efficient, you'll not have the right services, you just can't operate at the end of the day.""
Car manufacturers, guarding their gatekeeper role in accessing data from their vehicles, have resisted specific regulations for in-vehicle data, saying that protecting consumers is paramount. 
""Europe's auto industry is committed to giving access to the data generated by the vehicles it produces,"" said a spokesperson for the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA). ""However, uncontrolled access to in-vehicle data poses major safety, (cyber) security, data protection and privacy threats."" 
Yet the companies lined up against them say limiting or charging what they deem unfair amounts for access to in-vehicle data could kill off competition for carmakers who already operate their own leasing firms, car subscription services and repair shops.
In some cases, they say carmakers are already restricting access to vehicle data and charging independent repair shops more for access. 
""The manufacturers are in direct contact with the vehicle, so they get all the data,"" says Sylvia Gotzen, CEO of the International Federation of Automotive Aftermarket Distributors, or FIGIEFA, which is part of a broader alliance of repair shops and parts makers that employs 3.5 million people in Europe. 
""They get the full buffet and all we get is some crumbs.""
CARMAKERS: WE SHARE DATA
Vehicle manufacturers have big plans for data.
For example Stellantis, the world's No. 4 carmaker, expects to generate 20 billion euros ($22.4 billion) annually by 2030 from software products and subscription services. Such offerings are also central to General Motors (NYSE:GM)' plan to double annual revenue to around $280 billion.
Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said data is becoming the ""key source of value creation and innovation"", adding that customers have ""full control"" over it, citing vehicle security and customer sovereignty as its main focuses.
BMW rejected suggestions it was withholding data. 
The German company said it can share nearly 100 data points with third parties if drivers requested it and could make more available if companies prove a real business need for them and a willingness to take responsibility for cybersecurity risks. Auto supplier groups like FIGIEFA say carmakers can access thousands of data points. 
A BMW spokesperson said the carmaker would like all sides to sit down with a mediator such as the European Commission and hammer out a list of data points that is acceptable to everyone.
Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares told reporters on Friday that the carmaker aggregated data, which cost money, and so needed to be paid for it. He cited, as an example, data that Stellantis sells to cities to measure how often anti-lock braking systems are engaged at junctions and gauge which are the most dangerous. 
""It is not only collecting the data, it is also about crunching the data in a way that is going to create value for somebody willing to pay for it,"" Tavares said. 
'DATA IS ABSOLUTELY KEY' 
Yet other companies in the auto ecosystem, such as ALD, say they want the European Union to ensure a level playing field
ALD, in the process of buying Dutch rival LeasePlan to give it a combined fleet of 3.5 million vehicles, has a car-sharing platform that needs to run diagnostics, read the odometer, check the fuel gauge and switch cars between users.
It also offers an insurance product that lowers your premium based on good driving behaviour - monitoring how you accelerate and brake. 
""Access to data is absolutely key for us to provide the services we do today,"" CEO Albertsen said. 
To extract car data, ALD plugs a wireless ""dongle"" into the vehicle that transmits information to an in-house developed platform that it pays U.S. startup Vinli to operate. Carmakers running similar services get that data directly, putting ALD at a competitive disadvantage, Albertsen said.
Stellantis, for instance, offers car sharing and rentals through its Free2Move unit. Volkswagen could take over rental company Europcar to take advantage of car sharing and subscription services.
And most major carmakers have their own leasing units, like BMW's Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Mercedes-Benz's Athlon.
ALD's Albertsen said major fleet customers were willing to pay for the data but that he wanted regulations to ensure ALD's car-sharing unit paid the same as, for instance, Stellantis charges its own Free2Move division.
RISKS FOR REPAIR SHOPS
Insurers and car repair shops say it is paramount that the EU let drivers choose who accesses their vehicles' data.
    ""There is a need to regulate this, as you cannot leave this in the hands of car manufacturers,"" said Nicolas Jeanmart, industry group Insurance Europe's head of personal and general insurance. ""It should be for each driver to decide what they want to do with their data.""
FIGIEFA's Gotzen said that would allow car owners to link their preferred repair shop to their car and have it run remote diagnostics if they had car trouble, instead of relying solely on the manufacturer's recommendations.
""All of this is technically possible now, but we are hampered because car manufacturers prevent us from doing this,"" she said.
She said FIGIEFA's members are willing to adopt carmakers' cybersecurity processes and requirements, but added cybersecurity could serve as an excuse for carmakers to restrict access.

Richard Knubben, deputy director general of Leaseurope, which represents Europe's leasing and car rental firms, said the longer the EU took to legislate car data, the more independent repair shops are at risk of going out of business because they lack access to it.
""By the time we get legislation we may already be stuck with an imbalance that we can't fix anymore,"" Knubben said.

""People like to bet on somebody and look someone in their face and see their conviction,"" said Tom Lydon, an asset management veteran. ""That has helped override any concerns that this fund is broken."" 
Wood, one of the few prominent female fund managers on Wall Street, is facing one of the greatest challenges of her professional career: how to show the world that she is simply more than the face of what some are calling the pandemic bubble.
While much has been written about the decline of her ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund, this story is the first to draw on a range of interviews, with about a dozen ARK employees, investors, and others within Wood's world, to show how she is trying to keep her reputation intact as she navigates the flip side of fame. 
Wood related to Lydon a recent conversation she had with an angry client who had millions invested with her fund and was prepared to pull it all out. She listened to their concerns without interrupting. Finally, it was her turn to speak. 
""We have the same commitment to our strategy that we did at the market top, and if you liked it back then you should love it even more because valuations have become more attractive,"" she told the client from her office high above the palm trees of St. Petersburg, Florida, where she recently moved from New York. 
By the end of the conversation, she had not only persuaded him to keep his money invested with her, but to add more to keep his overall allocation to her fund the same. 
Stirring the belief of seasoned investors may never be more critical for Wood. 
In the space of three years she rose from relative obscurity to being hailed as one of America's greatest stock oracles in 2020 after she made gains of about 150% by piling into shares such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) before they hit the stratosphere. 
Yet inflation soon began to sap the life out of the highly valued tech disruptor stocks she's famed for. From there, gravity seemed to take over, pulling the fund lower and lower last year despite a 20%-plus gain in the broad S&P 500. With the Russian invasion of Ukraine compounding losses, Wood's flagship fund is now down nearly 63% from its February 2021 high. 
While Wood declined to be interviewed for this article, those close to her say she is fielding multiple calls a day from financial advisers and investors to convince them to stick with her. 
At the same time, she is making a conscious drive to appear in more public forums, such as TV interviews and conferences, in order to bolster the confidence of retail investors who make up a significant portion of her fund base. 
SHORTING THE STAR
Her conviction does not waiver in private, said Robby Greengold, an analyst at investment research firm Morningstar who regularly speaks with her. ""She doesn't present herself any differently in person than in public,"" he added. 
Wood, a prominent backer of bitcoin, believes technology is advancing at a more rapid pace than many investors realize and will cleave a handful of winners away from a growing trash pile of companies on the losing side of disruption.
Not everyone has faith, though. Not by a long shot.
In fact, a lack of confidence in Wood's long-term prospects led Tuttle Capital to launch an ETF that solely shorts her positions - the first known time that an ETF has specifically shorted the strategy of a single active manager. 
""We wanted to short speculative technology and, lucky for us, ARK had already designed that package,"" said Matthew Tuttle, the head of Tuttle Management, whose fund has swelled to $350 million in assets and is up about 90% since it began trading in November.
More broadly, short-sellers of ARK funds are up $712 million this year through Feb. 16, marked against market prices, a gain that puts them up 22.16% for the year versus a 5.2% gain for shorting the entire domestic ETF market, according to technology and data analytics company S3 Partners. 
On Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, which helped power the retail pandemic trading frenzy of ""meme"" stocks, a recent discussion is entitled ""What's the Consensus on Cathie Wood"".
""She literally took all of the bubble stocks, put them into an ETF, and just expected the bubble to just keep skyrocketing,"" one post says. 
A DAY IN THE LIFE
The interviews with the people close to 66-year-old Wood offer a window upon a day in the life of the celebrated stock picker.
7 a.m: She begins work at her office in a 26-storey tower just a few blocks away from the shimmering waters of Tampa Bay, often listening to earnings calls of companies in her portfolio and potential acquisitions.
8:45 a.m: she joins a call with her analyst team. On Friday mornings, she also holds a two-hour video meeting with her analysts and industry experts on how technology will drive societal change that she occasionally opens to select investors. 
The rest of the day is spent on calls with clients, trading decisions, and increasingly frequent media appearances, whether in the form of a nearly 45-minute grilling of her positions on CNBC or the firm's own YouTube shows and webinars. 
""She is more than willing to speak with any client that's out there to walk through what is happening in the market and just reassure them this is an opportunity,"" said Renato Leggi, a client portfolio manager at ARK. 
Wood might not need to convince her roughly 45-person staff at ARK Invest, where belief in her remains as powerful as the Florida sunshine. 
""People follow and are willing to give their life or entrust in her because of her humility,"" said Alex Cahana, a theme developer at ARK since 2014, helping identify the industry trends that could shape ARK's investment strategy. 
Her conviction in the face of piling losses appears to be resonating with investors.
This year alone, they have entrusted more than half a billion dollars in net inflows to her innovation fund, despite it turning in one of the worst performances of all funds tracked by Morningstar over the same time. 
Despite its recent losses, the fund has returned an annualised average of 27.5% over the last three years, putting it in the top 2% of the 491 U.S. mid-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar. That said, many investors who weren't there from the early days are now underwater. 
The fund's long-term track record is one reason to believe in Wood once inflation subsides, said Jimmy Lee, the head of Las Vegas-based Wealth Consulting Group, which has $2 billion in overall assets under management.
He said his group had added to its ARK investment in recent weeks: ""A lot of their names purchased in the past were way too rich in valuation, but now we're at a good entry point.""
'GO WHERE YOU NEED TO GO'
Woods, who has a deep-seated Christian faith, shot to finance fame relatively late in life after starting her career in 1980 at New York-based investment advisory firm Jennison Associates. She founded ARK in 2014 after other stints at Tupelo Capital Services and AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB).
While the sort of broad, thematic bets that are a hallmark of ARK's investment style has long been a part of her strategy, her willingness to take large positions - approximately 30% of her flagship fund is invested in the shares of five companies - has not always been welcomed at previous firms where she worked.
While she was chief investment officer of thematic portfolios at AllianceBernstein, the firm began to implement new constraints on how she could manage her fund following the market meltdown in 2008, adding limits on position sizes and requiring more sector diversification. 
Frustrated, Wood pitched the idea of a transparent, actively managed ETF to AllianceBernstein in 2013 but was refused, said Leggi. She left the firm and formed ARK Invest the following year. 
""You can't really run a constrained portfolio across innovation. You need to be able to go where you need to go when you want to,"" Leggi said. 
AllianceBernstein declined to comment for this article.
Wood's ability to retain investors despite large losses could be a sign that her fund won't become the pandemic version of the Munder NetNet fund, which soared to more than $11.5 billion in assets in the late 1990s thanks to bets on internet stocks, before falling over 90% once the dotcom bubble burst. Its once-celebrated portfolio manager, Paul Cook, left Wall Street and now works at a human resources software company.

Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF research at CFRA, said he admired Wood and ARK's ability to retain their appeal after a torrid year.
""Performance-chasing is much more common than investors demonstrating loyalty in the face of underperformance,"" he added. ""It is a credit to the shareholder base ARK has built.""

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 05:26PM ET</span>",A quarter of symptomatic kids hit by long COVID; mRNA shots provide best protection in breast milk,"By Nancy Lapid
(Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.
One in four kids with COVID develop lingering problems
One in four children with COVID-19 symptoms develop ""long COVID,"" according to data pooled from 21 earlier studies conducted in Europe, Asia, Australia and South America.
Among the 80,071 children with COVID-19 in the studies, 25% developed symptoms that lasted at least 4-to-12 weeks or new persistent symptoms that appeared within 12 weeks, researchers reported on Sunday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
The most frequent problems were neuropsychiatric (mood symptoms, fatigue, sleep disorders, headaches, cognitive alterations, dizziness, balance problems), cardiorespiratory (breathing difficulty, congestion, exercise intolerance, chest pain and tightness, cough, irregular heart rhythm), skin-related (excessive sweating, itchiness, hair loss) and gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea). Analyses of data pooled from many different studies with different methodologies cannot yield firm conclusions, the researchers acknowledge. What is clear, however, is that ""children and adolescents have also physical and mental health consequences derived from COVID-19,"" said study coauthor Sonia Villapol of Houston Methodist Research Institute in Texas.
""Identifying the main signs and symptoms of pediatric long COVID can help diagnose, develop better treatments, create multidisciplinary teams for optimal clinical management, and find risk factors for prevention.""
Vaccine protection in mother's milk strongest after mRNA shots
Women who wish to pass protective antibodies induced by COVID-19 vaccines to their babies via breast milk should opt for the mRNA shots from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) or Pfizer/BioNTech, according to a study reported on Monday in JAMA Pediatrics.
For the study, 124 lactating women each provided 17 milk samples over a period of 100 days.
The women had received either an mRNA vaccine or a vector-based vaccine from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) or AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN). Researchers measured two types of antibodies in the milk samples - IgA antibodies and IgG antibodies, both of which are thought to play important roles in protecting breastfed infants. Nearly all - 96% to 97% - of the women who received both doses of an mRNA vaccine had detectable IgA antibodies in their milk, while only 39% had antibodies in their milk after two doses of the AstraZeneca shot and 48% after the one-dose J&J vaccine. All the women who received both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccines had IgG antibodies, compared to only 28% of women who received J&J's shot. 
""An mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine is the optimal choice for lactating women when they want to transfer breast milk antibodies to their infants,"" the researchers concluded. 
Omicron is infectious on surfaces longer than original virus
Omicron particles remain infectious on surfaces for longer periods than particles of the original SARS-CoV-2, according to laboratory experiments.
Researchers put droplets of infectious virus from the original coronavirus version and the Omicron BA.1 variant on a variety of surfaces at room temperature.
On smooth surfaces (glass, stainless steel and plastic sheet), Omicron was still infectious after seven days, whereas particles of the original SARS-CoV-2 were no longer infectious on stainless steel and plastic sheets by day 4 and on glass by day 7, the researchers reported on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review.

On tissue paper and printing paper, the original virus was no longer infectious at 30 minutes. Omicron was still infectious at 30 minutes, but no longer after an hour, the researchers said. 
For the most part, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via respiratory droplets in the air. While infection via contact with contaminated surfaces is less common, the new study ""highlights the importance of hand hygiene and cleaning on surfaces that are regularly touched by different persons,"" said study coauthor Leo Poon of the University of Hong Kong. ""For surfaces and settings contaminated by a COVID-19 patient, proper cleaning should be done.""

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 05:10PM ET</span>","Barclays suspends sales of two products linked to oil, volatility","By Iain Withers and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - British bank  Barclays  (LON:BARC) said on Monday it had suspended the sales and issuance of two exchange-traded notes (ETNs) with combined assets of about $1 billion - one linked to crude oil and another to a gauge of market volatility - due to capacity constraints, in a move that some investors said could spur big price swings in the products.
ETNs are debt securities that banks issue with the promise to pay holders a return linked to the performance of underlying securities or benchmarks. Investors are particularly sensitive about the product ever since another volatility-tracking ETN called XIV went bust in a matter of days in February 2018, dealing nearly $2 billion in losses to shareholders.
The ETNs affected are called iPath® Pure Beta Crude Oil ETN and iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN . 
Barclays, which expects to reopen sales and issuances of the ETNs as soon as it can accommodate additional capacity, said the actions were not linked to the crisis in Ukraine or any issue with the market dynamics in the underlying index components. The bank does not have sufficient capacity to support further sales from inventory and any further issuances of the ETNs, it said in a statement. 
Barclays declined to elaborate further on the reasons for the actions, which were effective from the opening of trading on Monday.
""My first reaction is that Barclays is probably trying to de-risk,"" said Brent Kochuba, founder of analytic service SpotGamma, noting a recent jump in trading volume in VXX.
Some 71 million VXX shares changed hands daily over the last month, about double the average daily volume over the past year, as investors placed bets on stock market volatility as the Russia-Ukraine crises roiled global financial markets.
Matt Thompson, managing partner at Chicago-based investment adviser Thompson Capital Management, which specializes in volatility trading, said Barclays' move could have been prompted by a lack of liquidity in the market.
Analysts warned that the suspension of the share creation process for the two ETNs might cause their trading price to stray from their indicative price - where they should be trading based on the value of their underlying securities.
Typically, large banks buy and sell shares to generally keep the trading price of the ETNs in line with their indicative value. But with the suspension of new shares that process can break.
""The trading price of these securities can 'float' up without any effective constraint above the indicative price,"" said Vance Harwood, who runs the alternative investment website Six Figure Investing and is a consultant focused on volatility-linked products.
VXX finished the day up 9.4% at $28.81, or $1.58 higher than its indicative price, the largest this gap has been in more than a year.
But that can collapse fast, analysts warned.
For instance, shares of VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (TVIX) collapsed nearly 60% over the course of four trading sessions in March 2021, after the ETN's issuer,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), reopened issuance of TVIX shares after a one-month suspension. 
SHORT SQUEEZE CANDIDATE
For VXX - a heavily shorted instrument with about 90% of its shares sold short - the halt of share creation makes it a prime candidate for a potential short squeeze, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said.
Short sellers sell borrowed shares, looking to make a profit by buying back the shares at a later date at a lower price. A short squeeze happens when short sellers are unable to find shares to buy to close their bearish bets even as the share price rises.

VXX short sellers are down about $198 million for the year-to-date, according to S3 data.
""VXX shorts are already teetering ... the lack of supply might really put them over the edge,"" Dusaniwsky said.

(Reuters) - The share price of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc reached $500,000 for the first time on Monday, reflecting the company's status as a defensive stock in a market unsettled by events in Ukraine and rising inflation.
Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 10% in 2022, outpacing the Standard & Poor's 500 index, which has fallen 12%.
The Omaha, Nebraska-based company's market value is approximately $731 billion, ranking sixth in the United States, and Buffett's 16.2% stake makes him the world's fifth-richest person at $119.2 billion, according to Forbes magazine.
Berkshire generated a record $27.46 billion of operating profit last year, including gains at Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy.
It also owns dozens of other businesses, including the fast-growing Clayton Homes mobile home unit and the largest U.S. residential real estate brokerage.
Berkshire specializes in ""on the ground, Main Street-esque business activity,"" said Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management Inc in Phoenix, which invests about $4.3 billion and owns Berkshire stock.
""They're big and they're not a tech stock, and investors get comfort from that.""
Berkshire shares also slightly outperformed the S&P 500 in 2021, after lagging in 2019 and 2020. They closed up 0.8% on Monday at $493,785.
Most Berkshire operating units focus on the United States, and about 77% of its approximately 372,000 employees work there.
Among those expanding elsewhere is Dairy Queen, which plans by 2030 to add 600 stores in China, already its largest market outside the United States.
Berkshire traded below $20 when Buffett took over the then-struggling textile company in 1965. Its Class B shares are worth about 1/1500th of Class A shares.

U.S. companies with larger market capitalizations include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL),  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. Apple is also Berkshire's largest common stock holding.
Berkshire ended 2021 with $146.7 billion in cash, though it has since invested well over $5 billion in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) as oil prices soared.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 19 cents on revenue of $193.3 million. Revenue increased 18% compared to the same period last year, while the company reported an adjusted EPS of 17 cents for the same period the previous year.
Subscription revenue for the company was $173 million, an increase of 28% compared to the same period last year. Calculated billings were $318.5 million, an increase of 18% year-on-year.
Full-year fiscal 2022 revenue was $725.3 million, an increase of 34% from last year.
While the company's fourth quarter earnings came in above consensus estimates, its outlook disappointed.
Looking ahead, the company expects fiscal 2023 full-year revenue to be between $836 million and $840 million, with subscription revenues between $756 million and $760 million. As a result, Coupa sees adjusted earnings per share for the year from 15 cents to 19 cents. Analysts surveyed by FactSet estimated earnings per share for the year of 73 cents on revenue of $876.4 million.
""We finished the fiscal year strong, delivering record revenue and free cash flow results in the fourth quarter,"" said Rob Bernshteyn, chairman and CEO at Coupa.

Investing.com – The S&P 500 ended lower Monday, as energy was hurt by a slump in oil prices and tech wobbled on surging Treasury yields ahead of expectations for the Federal Reserve to hikes rates in the coming the days.     
The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0%, or 1 point, the Nasdaq fell 2%. The Nasdaq closed in bear market territory, defined as a 20% loss from a recent peak, for the first time since March 2020. 
Little progress was made on Ukraine-Russia negotiations on Monday, but with talks set to resume on Tuesday, there is hope that both sides' willingness for ongoing dialogue could prove the building blocks toward a ceasefire agreement.
Oil prices, which have been underpinned recently by concerns that a prolonged Ukraine-Russia war would meaningfully disrupt crude supplies, moved sharply lower and took energy stocks along for the ride.     
Sentiment on energy was further soured by downgrades from Morgan Stanley on oil majors including Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) to equal-weight from overweight, citing valuation concerns.
With just days to go until the Federal Reserve is widely expected to begin its rate hiking cycle, Treasury yields surged higher. Rising rates, the enemy of growth sectors of the market like tech wobbled. 
“After a 25 basis point hike at the March meeting, we see the Fed delivering an additional five 25 basis point rate hikes this year, followed by four hikes in 2023 to end the year at 2.625%,” Morgan Stanley said in a note.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) led the move lower suffering a more than 2% decline amid some worries about a shortage of supplies after Foxconn, one of its major suppliers China, said it would suspend operations in Shenzhen following a rise in Covid-19 cases.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) were also 2% lower, while Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) bucked the trend up less than 1%.
But not all sectors are vulnerable to rising rates. Financials started the week on the front foot as investors bet that banks are set to benefit from a rising interest rates environment.
 Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS),  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW), Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF), with the latter up more than 5%.

Investing.com – Stocks fell on Monday in volatile up and down trading on continued worries about Russia’s war on Ukraine.
The Federal Reserve is set to meet beginning Tuesday for its two-day meeting, and expectations are that it will cut interest rates by a quarter-point in the first of a series of rate increases this year at it tries to tame inflation.
The effects of Russia’s war on Ukraine on inflation haven’t fully appeared in the data so far, but the Fed will be acting with that uncertainty lingering. Job gains have been strong, but gasoline prices have surged in recent weeks. 
Russia’s aggression has sent global markets into tumult, though oil prices have plunged in recent days, retreating back to the $100 a barrel level.
Despite efforts at negotiating, there is little news out of talks for a ceasefire in Ukraine, where people continue to stream over the border of Poland and elsewhere seeking refuge from the fighting.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Oil seesaw
Oil prices hit their lowest in two weeks, with U.S. crude briefly breaking the $100 per barrel support, on signs that diplomacy might actually win in the Russia-Ukraine war despite Moscow signaling no commitment to abort its intent to conquer the capital Kyiv.
Reports of new Covid-19 lockdowns in China’s Shenzhen and Jilin areas over ramping Omicron cases also stirred risk aversion among investors, many of whom had thought the pandemic to be over for all intent and purpose.  
2. China EV stocks
Stocks and ADRs of Nio (NYSE:NIO), Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV) and Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) slumped on fears the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was taking a tough stand against any Chinese company that fails to meet the audit requirements of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.
The act allows the SEC to delist and ban companies from trading on U.S. exchanges if regulators are unable to review company audits for three straight years.
Nio, XPeng, and Li Auto are not named in the list of five companies the SEC cited last week for not meeting the audit norms, but investors fear the automakers could come in the line of fire.
3. TV wars
Amid the streaming wars, companies that gather data to deliver to television advertisers are in focus. Nielsen Holdings PLC (NYSE:NLSN) shares jumped on Monday on a WSJ report that a consortium of several private equity groups, including Elliott Management Corp, is in advanced discussions to purchase the TV ratings business. Expect more focus on Nielsen shares this week to see if the deal goes through.

Investing.com -- Nielsen shares jumped 37% on a report in The Wall Street Journal that a consortium of several private equity groups, including Elliott Management Corp., is in advanced discussions to purchase the TV ratings business.
The deal would see Nielsen Holdings PLC (NYSE:NLSN) sold for around $15 billion, including debt, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Discussions with several banks are said to have taken place with a deal possibly completed within weeks. However, there is no assurance that an agreement will be reached, with there still being the potential for negotiations to fall apart.
Nielsen had a market value of $6.2 billion on Monday, with a so-called enterprise value of more than $11 billion due to a large debt of over $5 billion.
Nielsen provides audience estimates for television networks to sell commercial slots. However, with the growth of streaming and traditional TV losing viewers in recent years, the company's services have become less valuable. Elliott has held a stake in Nielsen since 2018."

The group's electronics division currently employs 13,000 workers, of which 8,500 are in Italy. The division designs, develops, produces and supports radar systems, advanced sensor technology and protection and defence systems for aviation, space, land-based and naval platforms. 
""The plan will see Leonardo invest 200 million euros in Italian industry each year, plus an additional 50 million euros will be used to optimise Leonardo's sites in Italy in each of the first three years of the plan,"" the group said in a statement.
In parallel, the Italian group will also invest 300 million euros over three years in its electronics business in Britain.

The company will create a new centralised logistics hub in Pomezia, near Rome, which will enable significant improvements in operational performance, efficiency and quality assurance.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Shareholders at four U.S. oil companies will vote in the coming quarter on proposals for the firms to meet emissions targets set out in Paris in 2015, said climate activist group Follow This. 
The votes will test shareholder willingness to impose new air pollution restrictions amid high energy prices and new energy security fears following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
""We were positively surprised,"" said Follow This founder Mark van Baal. ""This shows that most oil majors accept the winds of change at the SEC."" 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last fall raised the hurdle for companies seeking to exclude environment and social proposals from facing shareholders. 
Follow This is an activist group of 8,000 shareholders who hold stakes in oil companies in Europe and the United States. 
While Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has sought to bar the group's proposal saying the claims have already been ""substantially implemented"",  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM),  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) each have not blocked the group's petition, said van Baal. 
Occidental and Phillips 66 declined to comment. Exxon said it considers feedback and input from shareholders. Chevron said it only asks to exclude any proposal that do not comply with SEC shareholder petition rules. Conoco did not respond to a request for comment.
Follow This previously put similar proposals calling for the oil firms to ""substantially reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."" Those petitions last year were supported by 61% of voting shareholders at Chevron, 58% at Conoco and 80% at Phillips 66, according to company filings.
Follow This now proposes that companies set goals consistent with the 2015 Paris accord, an agreement to reduce emissions in half by 2030.
Oil prices this month have hit 14-year highs https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/global-markets-wrapup-2-pix-2022-03-07 above $130 a barrel as buyers steered clear of Russian products following its invasion of Ukraine. That jump should accelerate investments in renewable energy and away from fossil fuels, he said. [O/R] 

""Maybe in the very short term they have to replace Russia supply with oil from other countries. But in the long term we don't need more oil and gas,"" Van Baal said. 
""There is no time for a slow transition anymore.""

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - State-run Brazilian oil company Petrobras is close to reaching an agreement to sell to U.S. private equity firm EIG Energy Partners control of a natural gas pipeline that connects Bolivia and southern Brazil, three people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, is expected to receive more than $500 million for the 51% stake in TBG, added one of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private negotiations. The bid could reach up to $1 billion depending on details of the talks.
Under negotiation is Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolivia-Brasil (TBG), which operates the Brazilian section of the pipeline, called Gasbol.
The roughly 2,600 km (1,600 mile) pipeline system is the main transportation network for natural gas in the south of Brazil. It generated more than 900 million reais ($180 million) of operating profit for its owners in the first nine months of last year.
Gasbol can transport up to 30 million cubic meters per day (1.1 billion cubic feet per day) of natural gas from Bolivia to consumer markets in Brazil. 
Petrobras declined to comment on the talks. EIG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last year, EIG sold a 27.5% stake in TBG to Fluxys Belgium NV for an undisclosed amount in order to remove a regulatory conflict that could have prevented it from bidding for control of the asset.
TBG will be the third gas pipeline company privatized in recent years in Brazil.
In 2016, Petrobras sold Nova Transportadora do Sudeste (NTS), which runs through southeastern states, for $5.2 billion to a consortium led by Canada's Brookfield Asset Management and Brazil's Itausa SA . 

In 2019, Petrobras sold pipeline company TAG for $8.7 billion to France's Engie and Canadian pension fund CDPQ.

1038,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 02:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Chevron set to trade Venezuelan oil if U.S. relaxes sanctions -sources,"By Marianna Parraga and Matt Spetalnick
HOUSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Chevron Corp. is preparing to take operating control of its joint ventures in Venezuela if Washington relaxes sanctions on Caracas to boost crude supplies after banning Russia's oil imports, according to three people familiar with the situation.
The U.S. oil major has begun assembling a trading team to market oil from Venezuela, two of the people said. If U.S. approvals are received,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) aims to expand its role in the four joint ventures it shares with state-run company PDVSA, they added. 
Chevron has asked the U.S. government for a license broad enough to have a greater say at its joint ventures in Venezuela, a first step to recovering crude output and exports, and to control where oil is sent, the three people said. Since 2020, Chevron has delegated most decision making to state-run PDVSA.
U.S. officials have made clear, however, that any new authorization will depend on whether Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro takes further political steps, two sources said, such as releasing more jailed Americans and setting a firm date for resuming negotiations with the Venezuelan opposition.
Chevron's proposed moves could revitalize Venezuela's oil output and exports after years of underinvestment and sanctions shrank it to about 755,000 barrels per day (bpd) last month from 2.3 million bpd in 2016. Chevron's joint ventures with PDVSA had produced about 200,000 bpd before U.S. sanctions and lack of financing cut their output. 
LOGISTICS TEAM 
A date has not been set for issuing the authorization. But Chevron has begun preparations for employees to get Venezuelan visas in Aruba, ready to head to Caracas if the U.S. Treasury eases restrictions, the people said. 
Last week, U.S. President Joe Biden banned U.S. imports of Russian oil, adding to an array of sanctions after Russia invaded Ukraine, an action Moscow has called a ""special military operation."" 
Chevron aims to begin moving Venezuelan oil to refineries as soon as next month. Last week's U.S. ban on Russian imports allows oil under existing contracts to arrive in the country through April 22. 
""Since Venezuelan barrels were banned in the United States in 2019, and Colombia and Mexico reduced key exports to the United States, Russian barrels have been feeding the Gulf refiners"", said one person involved in the talks. 
Chevron had vastly reduced its presence in Venezuela after Washington tightened sanctions on Venezuela in 2020. For years, Chevron and other PDVSA venture partners have requested more operating oversight. 
The United States is drafting a new license that would allow Chevron to assume a more active role in Venezuela, a person familiar with the matter said. Washington is considering similar oil-for-debt authorizations for Spain's Repsol (OTC:REPYY) and Italy's Eni SpA. They collectively are owed billions of dollars by their Venezuela joint ventures.
Chevron declined to comment, but reiterated in a statement its operations in Venezuela comply with U.S. sanctions and remain ""a constructive presence in Venezuela."" 
PDVSA and Venezuela's oil ministry did not reply to requests for comment.
A State Department spokesperson said the U.S. government ""does not preview sanctions actions"" but added: ""We have made clear that we would review some sanctions policies if the Venezuelan parties made meaningful progress in the Venezuelan-led negotiations in Mexico toward a democratic solution.""
The U.S. Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
POLITICAL TALKS 
This month, Washington quietly restarted diplomatic engagement with Venezuela, a close ally of Russia. Last week, Maduro released two jailed Americans, and Washington has insisted others also be freed. Maduro has expressed a willingness to resume a dialogue with the opposition after he suspended talks in Mexico in October. U.S. officials want a firm commitment to discussing free elections.
On Sunday, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC any sanctions relief for Venezuela must be tied to ""concrete steps"" by Maduro.
The Biden administration had not previously made Venezuela a foreign policy priority. That changed when Middle East and U.S. shale producers would not boost their crude supplies when the White House asked them to do so after the Ukraine invasion.
Congressional Republicans and even some of Biden's fellow Democrats such as U.S. Senator Bob Menendez have opposed any deal that would benefit the socialist president. Washington condemned Maduro's 2018 re-election as a sham.
The United States imported 670,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil and fuel last year. One of the few countries in a position to replace those imports is Venezuela. Before sanctions, its oil went mainly to U.S. Gulf Coast refiners. 
TIMELY APPROVAL 
Chevron-marketed barrels could help PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF),  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO), and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) fill their supply gap, the source said. All have operations geared to run heavy oils. 
Chevron has held parallel talks with PDVSA to expand its joint ventures' governance. Any agreements likely would be temporary unless Venezuela enacts deep reforms of its oil legislation, which require PDVSA to be the majority stakeholder in any joint venture. 

While PDVSA President Asdrubal Chavez supports an expanded operating role for Chevron, some Venezuelan top officials resist the change, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Venezuela holds about 300 billion barrels of oil reserves, the world's largest, but has not been able to hit its production targets due to underinvestment, poor maintenance, lack of supplies and U.S. sanctions.

Saudi Arabia is reviewing Foxconn's offer to build a dual-line semiconductor contract manufacturing facility known as a ""foundry"" in Neom, a tech-focused city-state it is developing in the desert, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. 
The company and Saudi Arabia authorities did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer and a major Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, has expanded into areas including electric vehicles (EVs) and semiconductors in recent years.
The company and other Taiwanese firms like TSMC are looking to diversify their production amid U.S.-China trade tensions, which have impacted the semiconductor industry.
Besides Saudi Arabia, Foxconn is also talking with the United Arab Emirates about potentially situating the project there, the report said.

Riyadh wants the company to guarantee that it would direct at least two-thirds of the foundry's production into Foxconn's existing supply chain, according to the report.
Foxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, has been signing large investment deals, including plans in Taiwan and India. Last year, however, it drastically scaled back a planned $10 billion factory in Wisconsin that former U.S. President Donald Trump once called ""the eighth wonder of the world"".

1044,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 12:56PM ET</span>",Canada's top stock index shines as investors seek inflation hedge,"By Alexander Schummer and Fergal Smith
TORONTO (Reuters) - As Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupts the global economy and drives up oil, gold and industrial metal prices, investors are embracing Canada's commodity-linked stock market to protect their portfolios from the impact of supply shortages and soaring inflation.
Financial markets globally have been rattled in recent months by rising inflation as economies recover from the coronavirus pandemic, with matters made worse by the spike in commodity prices after sanctions against Russia, the world's top wheat exporter and second-biggest oil exporter.
Canada offers a hedge of sorts. It produces many of the energy, metal and agricultural products in short supply, while its main stock index, the S&P/TSX Composite, has a 27% weighting in energy and materials, indicating that the earnings of a large chunk of the market are directly tied to rising commodity prices.
Inflation-linked bonds are a more conventional hedge for investors fearing price spikes, but some prefer to maintain exposure to equity markets.
""The TSX is a preferential allocation within global equities, given the relatively cheap valuation still and the more muted macro economic impact of the war on the Canadian economy,"" said Kurt Reiman, senior investment strategist for North America at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK).
The Toronto market is one of the few major indexes globally that is in positive territory since the start of the year, having advanced 0.5%, compared to a decline of 11.3% for the S&P 500 index, the U.S. equities benchmark.
At 14.6, the 12-month forward price-earnings multiple for the TSX is slightly below its average for the last 10 years, data from Refinitiv Datastream shows, and well below the S&P 500's multiple of about 18.5.
The Toronto market's large concentration of resource shares ""provides a good hedge for global investors against the possibility of a prolonged commodity supply-shock,"" said Angelo Kourkafas, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Missouri.
Foreign investors have taken notice, plowing a net C$46 billion ($36 billion) into Canadian equities last year, the most since 2016, according to data from Statistics Canada.
Among the companies that investors favor are copper miner Hudbay Minerals (NYSE:HBM) Inc, which trades at a forward price-to-book ratio of 1.24 versus the industry average of 1.61, Refinitiv data shows.
Its valuation should play catch-up as the company has ""laid the groundwork"" for growth, said Michael Sprung, president at Sprung Investment Management.
Paul Gardner, a portfolio manager at Avenue Investment Management, says the gold sector is ""generally cheap"" relative to the price of bullion. He sees Agnico Eagle (NYSE:AEM) Mines Ltd as a long-term buy and expects Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources, the country's biggest oil producer, to benefit from the rally in oil prices.
EYE ON DIVIDENDS
But it's not just resource shares that help differentiate the Toronto market. It's also the market's heavy weighting, at 31%, in financials.
""An inflationary environment generally coincides with rising interest rates, which benefit banks and insurers,"" said Elvis Picardo, portfolio manager at Luft Financial, iA Private Wealth.
Earlier this month, the Bank of Canada raised its key interest rate for the first time in three years and made clear that further hikes are on the way. The Federal Reserve is expected to announce a lift-off in U.S. rates on Wednesday.
Adding to the attraction of financial and energy shares in the current environment are high dividend payouts compared to some other sectors such as technology.

""When there are concerns about global growth, the dividend starts to become more important,"" BlackRock's Reiman said. ""You tend to see Canadian stocks delivering because of that sector exposure.""

Investing.com --  Moderna  Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) has dosed the first participant in a clinical trial of an experimental human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) trimer mRNA vaccine, the company said Monday. 
Moderna shares rose 17% after the announcement.
Moderna explained in a press release that the open-label, multicenter, randomized Phase 1 trial is designed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of experimental HIV trimer mRNA vaccines.
The company's idea is that the trimer mRNA vaccines will be safe and well-tolerated by HIV-uninfected individuals and will produce neutralizing antibodies.
The trial, sponsored and funded by the Division of AIDS of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases within the National Institutes of Health, will enroll approximately 100 HIV-negative adults aged 18 to 55 years.
""Developing a vaccine regimen that induces sustained protective levels of HIV neutralizing antibodies in humans has been difficult to achieve. At Moderna, we believe that mRNA offers an opportunity to take a fresh approach to this challenge,"" said Stephen Hoge, president of Moderna.

The act allows the SEC to delist and ban companies from trading on U.S. exchanges if regulators are unable to review company audits for three straight years.
Shares of Li Auto and Xpeng were down 16% and 10%, respectively, while Nio ADRs lost 8%. ADRs are U.S.-listed securities of non-U.S. companies. Their shares may or may not be listed elsewhere.

Zhong Shanshan, known as China’s king of bottled water, led the plunge as his fortune fell by $5 billion, while Tencent Holding Ltd.’s Pony Ma dropped $3.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Shares of Zhong’s Nongfu Spring Co. tumbled 10% in Hong Kong trading -- the most in 18 months -- though he still remains China’s wealthiest person with a fortune of $60.3 billion. Tencent fell the most since 2011 after a report that it’s facing a record fine for violating anti-money laundering rules. Pony Ma, once the country’s wealthiest person, is now third with a net worth of $35.2 billion.
The slide in Chinese stocks accelerated Monday after U.S. officials said Russia asked Beijing to help with the war in Ukraine, raising concerns over a backlash against Chinese companies, potentially even sanctions. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index tracking shares traded in Hong Kong sank the most since November 2008, while the Hang Sang Tech Index tumbled 11% for the worst decline since its inception.
The drop cost the 78 Chinese billionaires among the world’s 500 richest people a cumulative $52.1 billion.

Tencent fell 9.8% to its lowest price since March 2020 on Monday. The Wall Street Journal reported the People’s Bank of China found its WeChat Pay had allowed the transfer of funds for illicit purposes, along with other issues. While China’s industry crackdown has already erased billions from the value of the nation’s tech giants, Tencent had so far mostly managed to avoid regulatory action. 
Zhang Yiming of ByteDance Ltd. -- which is private and therefore more shielded from the recent market volatility -- is the country’s second-richest person, with a fortune of $44.5 billion.
Jack Ma, who was China’s wealthiest before Pony Ma surpassed him, now ranks No. 4 with a net worth of $34.3 billion. His fortune surpassed $60 billion in late 2020, before the government started its anti-monopolistic campaign, halting the listing of his Ant Group Co. payments company just two days before it was scheduled to go public. 
On Friday, Didi Global Inc. shares slumped a record 44% as the ride-hailing giant suspended preparations for a Hong Kong listing. Its founder, Cheng Wei, lost his billionaire status.

Global companies have decided to step back from Russia as pressure mounts from consumers in the West to take a stand against its invasion of Ukraine.
""Ending delivery of medicines, including cancer or cardiovascular therapies, would cause significant patient suffering and potential loss of life, particularly among children and elderly people,"" Pfizer said. 
The drugmaker, however, will not start new clinical trials or recruit patients for ongoing studies in the country. It would also cease all planned investments towards manufacturing in Russia. 
The invasion has left drugmakers scrambling to get enrollments in clinical trials in Ukraine as millions seek shelter from bombardment and flee to neighboring countries.
Germany's Bayer said on Monday it stopped all spending in Russia and its ally Belarus, which is not related to essential products in health and agriculture, in response to Moscow's actions which Russia describes as a ""special operation"". 
Russia accounts for about 2% of the German group's sales. 
Bayer said on Monday it had already provided essential agricultural inputs to farmers in Russia for the 2022 growing season ""to alleviate additional pressure on the global food system"". 
It would, however, decide over supplies for 2023 depending on Russia stopping its attacks on Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Pfizer said it would work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators to transition all clinical trials to alternative sites outside Russia. 

It will continue providing drugs to patients already enrolled in studies. 
Western drugmakers and medical-device companies have warned their plans to keep selling their products to Russia might become complicated due to the sanctions imposed on the country, even though they do not apply to such products.

Instagram access in Russia was cut from Monday in response to Meta's decision last week to allow social media users in Ukraine to post messages such as ""Death to the Russian invaders"". Facebook was already banned over what Moscow said were restrictions on access to Russian media there.
On the eve of the Instagram ban, demand for Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) that encrypt data and obscure where a user is located spiked 2,088% higher than the daily average demand in mid-February, data from monitoring firm Top10VPN showed.
Russia has been targeted by unprecedented western sanctions over its actions in Ukraine and is battling to control the flow of information, stifling foreign social media firms with traffic slowdowns and, in the case of Facebook and Instagram, outright bans. 
Demand for VPNs had already been on the rise in the region as Russian and Ukrainian websites fell victim to cyber attacks.
Russia banned several VPNs last year, but has failed to block them entirely, as part of a wider campaign critics say stifles internet freedom. 
Top10VPN's data analysis of more than 6,000 entries to Russia's central registry of blocked websites found that 203 news sites and 97 foreign exchange and crypto sites are currently blocked in Russia. 

State communications regulator Roskomnadzor on Monday said the number of cyber attacks against the IT systems and infrastructure of the Russian government had sharply increased since Feb. 24.
It warned perpetrators that cyber attacks may lead to criminal consequences.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group of five House Democratic lawmakers on Monday asked a federal watchdog to review if the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) complied with environmental regulations in its next-generation delivery vehicle contract.
House Oversight and Reform Committee chair Carolyn Maloney and other lawmakers asked the Postal Service Office of Inspector General to review USPS's plan to buy a new multibillion-dollar fleet of primarily gasoline-powered delivery vehicles from Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) that has come under fire from the White House and Environmental Protection Agency.
""Given the potential environmental impact of the (delivery vehicle) contract, it is crucial that the Postal Service conduct a robust environmental analysis prior to moving forward,"" said the letter also signed by Representatives Gerald Connolly, Jared Huffman, Stephen Lynch and Brenda Lawrence. 
USPS on Monday said its commitment to ""an electric fleet remains ambitious given the pressing vehicle and safety needs of our aging fleet as well as our fragile financial condition.""
The lawmakers asked why USPS assumed ""an upfront vehicle cost for an electric (delivery vehicle) that is substantially higher than other electric delivery vehicles being sold to private companies.""
Last month, the White House and EPA urged USPS to reconsider its plan. The EPA asked USPS to hold a new hearing on its 10-year contract with Oshkosh initially worth $482 million that could be worth $6 billion or more to build up to 165,000 next-generation delivery vehicles.
In response, USPS said it had completed its environmental obligations and declined to hold a new hearing.

USPS's current plan calls for it to acquire at least 10% of EVs for the new fleet but could boost that with additional funding from Congress.
The EPA last month said USPS's proposed new gas-powered vehicles ""are expected to achieve only 8.6 miles per gallon (mpg), barely improving over the decades-old long-life vehicles that achieve 8.2 mpg.""

ELMS and the SEC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
EV startup Lucid Group, which too went public through merger with a special purpose acquisition company, disclosed in December that it had received a subpoena from the regulator related to an investigation into its blank-check deal.
ELMS also said on Monday that it expects to make its Urban Delivery electric van not before the end of 2022, adding that it would not be able to launch its vehicles without securing additional liquidity.

FRANKFURT/LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Allianz (DE:ALVG) and Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) said on Monday they were cutting back on Russian business as European financial institutions turn their backs on Russia.
The German insurer and Swiss reinsurer join banks Deutsche, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) which have exited Russia following its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western government sanctions.
The moves will pile pressure on others to follow.
Allianz said it had put a stop to insuring new business in Russia and was no longer investing in Russia for its own portfolio.
Swiss Re said it was not taking on new business with Russian and Belarusian clients and was not renewing existing business with Russian clients. In a statement sent via email, Swiss Re said it was reviewing its current business relationships in Russia and Belarus.
The decisions follow similar action by other major European insurers and reinsurers, which provide cover for large projects such as energy installations.
Insurer Zurich no longer takes on new domestic customers in Russia and will not renew existing local business, a spokesperson told Reuters on Monday.
Hannover Re said last week that new business and renewals for customers in Russia and Belarus were on hold, while Italian insurer Generali (MI:GASI) said earlier this month it would pull out of Russia.
Insurance broker Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WTW) also said on Sunday it would withdraw from Russia, following similar moves by rivals Marsh and Aon (NYSE:AON). 
Asset managers have said they will not make new investments in Russia and many Russian-focused funds have frozen because they are unable to trade following the sanctions and counter-measures taken by Russia.
The European Union's markets watchdog ESMA said on Monday it was coordinating the bloc's regulatory response to the Ukraine conflict to ensure markets continued to function in an orderly manner. 
Britain's pensions regulator said the sector had little direct exposure to Russia, but that there were practical difficulties in selling Russian assets.
Ukraine said on Monday it had begun ""hard"" talks with Russia on a ceasefire, immediate withdrawal of troops and security guarantees after both sides reported rare progress in negotiations at the weekend, despite Russian bombardments.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"". 
WINDING DOWN
Deutsche, which had faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, announced late on Friday that it would wind down its business there.
It was a surprise reversal by the Frankfurt-based lender, which had previously argued that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in Russia. 
Britain's  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) also said late on Friday it was suspending all products and services for all customers in Russia, days after suspending the distribution of news and commentary in the country following new laws in Moscow.
Index provider FTSE Russell said on Monday it would delete four UK-listed, Russia-focused companies including Roman Abramovich's Evraz after many brokers refused to trade their shares.
Evraz, along with Polymetal International, Petropavlovsk and Raven (NASDAQ:RAVN) Property Group, would be deleted from all FTSE's indexes during the March review, it said in a statement.
FTSE Russell said it had received feedback from its External Advisory Committees and market participants that trading in the shares was ""severely restricted"" as brokers refused to handle the securities, hitting market liquidity.

JPMorgan says the majority of forecast risk for European banks from the Russia shock will come from commodity and economic spillover effects, with the sector plunging since the end of February.
European banking stocks have come off their lows in recent days, however, and rose 3.8% on Monday.

(Reuters) - Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc Chief Financial Officer Gunnar Wiedenfels on Monday provided the most concrete details to date about the media company's plans to combine its Discovery+ streaming service with HBO Max once the acquisition of WarnerMedia closes.
Wiedenfels said the services would unite to create a more broadly appealing consumer product, with HBO Max's more ""male skewing"" scripted series complementing Discovery's reality shows, with their heavily female viewership.
""The acquisition power of HBO Max, combined with the retention power of the Discovery content, I think, is going to make for a blowout DTC (direct-to-consumer) product,"" Wiedenfels told the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Annual Media, Internet & Telecom Conference, using the industry's term for streaming.
The melding of the two services, following the completion of Discovery's $43 billion acquisition of AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia in a deal announced in May 2021, had long been anticipated. 
Wiedenfels said the company would need to ""harmonize"" the separate technology platforms to offer a single streaming product, with more than 200,000 hours of movies and television episodes. There will be an ad-free service and a less expensive, ad-supported tier. 

The deal, on track to close in the second quarter, last month passed the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust review, clearing another key hurdle toward closing.
Discovery+ has 22 million subscribers, and HBO Max, together with its HBO television network, has 73.8 million subscribers.

""Withholding essential health and agriculture products from the civilian populations – like cancer or cardiovascular treatments, health products for pregnant women and children as well as seeds to grow food – would only multiply the war's ongoing toll on human life,"" the company said.

Same-store sales decreased around 20% from a year earlier for the first two weeks of March and was still trending down in recent days, after falling nearly 4% for the two months combined in January and February, Yum China said.
""Entering March, the situation has rapidly deteriorated with the highly transmissible Omicron variant causing outbreaks across China, including economically important regions of Guangdong, Shanghai, Shandong and Jilin,"" the company said.
The restaurant chain recorded a 1% fall in same-store sales last year, an improvement from the 9% decline in 2020. However, tight curbs on travel and dining out due to the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant have hurt sales this year.
The company projected an operating profit for the first quarter to be in a range of $165 million to $200 million, compared with $342 million a year earlier.
China has reported more local symptomatic COVID-19 cases so far this year than it recorded in all of 2021, as the highly transmissible Omicron variant triggers outbreaks from Shanghai to Shenzhen.

Over 1,100 Yum China restaurants were temporarily closed or offering only takeaway and delivery services, as of Sunday. It had more than 12,000 restaurants, as of February end.
Yum China's shares, which have taken a beating in recent days due to an auditing dispute between Beijing and Washington, fell as much as 10.5% to $33.55, a three-year low.

(Reuters) -Citigroup Inc on Monday followed rival Wall Street banks by accelerating its withdrawal from Russia, saying it is no longer taking on new clients and will further cut its exposure, raising the prospect it could take substantial losses.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C)'s decision follows rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS), which last week said they were unwinding their operations in Russia and not pursuing new business there. European lenders, such as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), have made similar moves.
Citigroup has exposure of nearly $10 billion in Russia, the most of any U.S. bank, and had previously warned it could lose nearly half of that in the worst-case scenario.
Citigroup declined to comment Monday on the financial impact of the decision. The bank's shares rose nearly 2% in early trading, outperforming the broader market. 
The bank had already planned to exit its Russia consumer business prior to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. It said last week that it was operating that business on a more limited basis while sticking with its plan to sell the franchise.
""We have now decided to expand the scope of that exit process to include other lines of business and continue to reduce our remaining operations and exposure,"" Edward Skyler, executive vice president for global affairs said Monday.
The decision means Citigroup will also be giving up its institutional and wealth management clients in Russia.
The bank will stop soliciting any new business or clients in Russia, Skyler said. It reiterated a previous commitment to ""provide assistance to multi-national corporations, many of whom are undergoing the complex task of unwinding their operations."" 
Citigroup's withdrawal will take time to execute, Skyler said, citing ""the nature of banking and financial services operations.""
Before Citi issued its statement,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo on Monday lowered his price target for the stock saying he expects Citi will have to book $1.5 billion of charges in the first quarter for expected losses on its Russian loans and business.
Mayo's new first quarter earnings estimate of $1.10 per share is down from $1.60. He had previously estimated Russia charges of only $300 million.

Wall Street analysts currently estimate, on average, that Citi will earn $1.89 in the first quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
Analysts have said that losses in Russia could restrict the bank's share buyback plans.

Investing.com –  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) stock traded 1.7% higher Monday on prospects of securing an order from Germany for 35 F-35 fighter jets.
The stealth jets will replace the aging Tornado aircraft that Germany plans to phase out between 2025 and 2030.
The Tornado is the only German jet capable of carrying U.S. nuclear bombs, stored in Germany, in case of a conflict.
Chancellor Olaf Scholz has decided to sharply increase the country’s spending on defense to more than 2% of its economic output, a decision heavily influenced by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that has forced many countries to revisit their security preparedness and up the defense spending.
Since the end of the Second World War, Germany has long refrained from getting involved in conflicts, resisting pressure to raise its defense spending in the light of its military past, and resulting in strong pacifism within its population.
Scholz’s government has decided to more than double last year’s military investment to 100 billion euros ($109 billion) in the 2022 budget.
As Germany reverses its policy, pressure on governments in other European nations could mount too, considering the heightened geopolitical risks in the region and the lack of unity among countries on critical security issues.
If the F-35 purchase happens, it will be a blow for Boeing (NYSE:BA), whose F-18 was favored by former German defense minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to replace the Tornado, according to Reuters."

BOSTON (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) on Monday recommended that  Huntsman  (NYSE:HUN) Corp investors elect two of activist investment firm Starboard Value's four director nominees to the chemical maker's 10-member board.
ISS said two Starboard director candidates should be elected to better oversee management after the board for several years failed to hold management accountable for operational stagnation, which translated into a lagging stock price.
James Gallogly, a former CEO of  LyondellBasell Industries  (NYSE:LYB), would bolster the board's independence and Jeffrey Smith, Starboard's managing member, would add the perspective of an independent shareholder, the report said.
ISS acknowledged that Huntsman has made a series of changes, including adding new board members and that its share price has improved dramatically. But ISS wrote that some of these changes were made only after Starboard began pressing for changes.
Investors will vote on March 25.
A Huntsman representative was not immediately available for comment on the ISS report.
""Adding Gallogly and Smith is the least-invasive way to address concerns with management accountability and ensure that the interests of shareholders are prioritized,"" the report said.
Starboard, which owns a 8.6% stake in Huntsman, has argued that the company failed to deliver on its promises and that it would disappoint shareholders again unless its nominees were elected.
Huntsman last year promised to improve margins, return $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases, not to spend more than $500 million on a single acquisition and to run a sales process for the non-core Textile Effects unit.
The ISS report came one day after a smaller advisory firm, Glass Lewis, recommended that shareholders re-elect all of Huntsman's nominees, arguing that the company is now on the right track and that Glass Lewis analysts do not see the need for more changes after the company already refreshed the board earlier this year.

Starboard wants to replace Cynthia Egan, the lead independent director, and Jose Munoz, who joined the board this year. It also is also targeting Mary Beckerle and Daniele Ferrari (NYSE:RACE), two directors Starboard says have conflicts.
ISS wrote that Beckerle is an accomplished cancer researcher but that there are concerns about her independence from Peter Huntsman, the founder's son who is now CEO and chairman. ISS said Jose Munoz is ""unproven as a director.""

In its invitation to the conference call, Intel said that Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger would speak about the company's current plans for investments in research and development as well as manufacturing of semiconductor chips.
A source told Reuters last month that Intel had chosen the east German city of Magdeburg as the site for a new multibillion-euro European chip factory.

The company said in September it could invest as much as $95 billion in Europe over the next decade and announce the locations of two major new European chip fabrication plants by the end of 2021, but no announcement has been made.
The source told Reuters last month that Intel was likely to consider France and Italy for new locations in Europe as it plans to build a design centre and packaging plant.

Investing.com – Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock traded 1.5% lower Monday after Foxconn (TW:2354), a major manufacturer of iPhones, halted production at its Shenzhen plant.
The company is complying with the Chinese government orders that came in after the worst COVID-19 outbreak in several cities of the country in two years.
Officials in Shenzhen, China's Silicon Valley, have temporarily suspended public transport and urged people to work from home as they carry out city-wide testing this week.
According to Reuters, Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, has suspended operations until further notice. The company will deploy backup plants to reduce the disruption of production.
Printed circuit board maker Unimicron Technology (TW:3037), also an Apple supplier, too, has suspended operations, Reuters said.  
Several cities in China including the economically important regions of Guangdong, Shanghai, Shandong, and Jilin are under lockdown.
Mainland China reported 1,337 new domestically transmitted COVID infections with confirmed symptoms on March 13, the National Health Commission said Monday. That brought the registered total this year to more than 9,000 compared with 8,378 in 2021, according to Reuters calculations."

At 9:39 a.m. ET (13:39 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index was down 131.59 points, or 0.61%, at 21,330.24, on track for its worst session in nearly three weeks.
The energy sector dropped 3.8% as oil prices fell by around $5 a barrel as investors pinned hopes on diplomatic efforts by Ukraine and Russia to end their conflict.[O/R]
Diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine have raised market hopes, with Ukrainian and Russian negotiators set to talk again after both sides cited progress.
""We had a lot of headlines that go back and forth regarding the Ukraine-Russia talks, but I think the name of the game is still going to be volatility and really can't trust anything until we see it actually occur in actions,"" said Gregory Taylor, portfolio manager at Purpose Investments. 
Meanwhile, reports on China seeing a surge in COVID-19 cases spooked global equities.
Investors await domestic consumer price data due later in the week, while U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting due later this week was also in focus.

1072,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 09:49AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Mixed as Peace Hopes Falter; Dow up 150 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Monday as hopes for a diplomatic settlement to the war in Ukraine evaporated amid signs that Russia is pursuing its goals with increased ferocity, while lockdowns in China revived fears of supply chain disruptions throughout the world.
By 9:45 AM ET (1345 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 155 points, or 0.5% at 33,099 points,. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% but the Nasdaq Composite was essentially flat from Friday's close, trading markedly weaker than index futures had done in the overnight session. All three indices had lost ground last week amid fears that the war may generate both an economic slowdown and sustained higher inflation.
The market is likely to hold off big moves this week until the Federal Reserve's policy meeting concludes on Wednesday. That's taking place against the backdrop of inflation running at its highest in 40 years, and the central bank's assessment of the interplay between growth and inflation in a wartime scenario is likely to be the cardinal factor driving markets for the rest of the week.
In the absence of big domestic corporate news over the weekend, and with the data and earnings calendars relatively empty, early attention was focused on Chinese ADRs, which were under pressure on a number of fronts. First, the manufacturing hub of Shenzhen and the region of Jilin in northeastern China have both announced week-long lockdowns to try to break the surge in COVID-19 cases. The developments appear to validate fears that the Omicron strain - which is largely impervious to the vaccines that have been most widely deployed in China - could force the authorities into heavy-handed measures that will put fresh strain on global supply chains. Among the companies to confirm the closure of their plants on Monday were Foxconn (TW:2354), which manufactures the iPhone for Apple, and Volkswagen. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 1.3% while Foxconn (OTC:HNHPF) ADRs fell a relatively modest 0.3%.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) stock rose 19% on hopes that the developments could give the company's mRNA-based vaccines access to a vast market that has so far been closed to it.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) stock rose 3.7% and BioNTech (NASDAQ:BNTX) stock rose 17% on similar hopes.
Other Chinese names fell more heavily, amid reports that online giant Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) is facing a record anti-money-laundering fine for allowing its WeChatPay service to be used for illicit purposes, such as gambling. Tencent ADRs fell 7.0% to a two-year low.  
The threat of another burst of regulatory activity had a broader effect on Chinese ADRs, with  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) ADRs falling 8.7% and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs falling 10.5%. The risk is not only from Chinese regulators but U.S. ones after National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan warned China that it would face consequences if it agreed to Russian requests for military assistance. Newswire reports cited Chinese officials as denying that they had received any such information, a day after U.S. security officials claimed to the contrary. Sullivan is to meet later with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi for discussions.  
Invesco's Golden Dragon China ETF (NASDAQ:PGJ), which tracks Chinese tech ADRs, fell another 7.4% to its lowest since July 2013 after J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts told customers to avoid the Chinese Internet sector up to a year.
Elsewhere, oil and gas stocks slid as news of the Chinese lockdowns triggered a quick reappraisal of the supply and demand balance globally.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 3.7% while Occidental (NYSE:OXY) stock fell 4.5% and  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN) stock fell 8.6%."
1073,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 09:45AM ET</span>","Telecom Italia shares rise on KKR, Open Fiber overtures","By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia shares rose on Monday after Italy's biggest phone group said it would pursue a domestic broadband deal, while also engaging in talks with KKR over the U.S. fund's 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) takeover approach.
After a near six-hour board meeting on Sunday where directors strove to reconcile diverging views on the path to take, TIM said it had asked its CEO and chairman to engage in talks with KKR to find out more about its potential bid.
At the same time, the board renewed its support for a plan which new CEO Pietro Labriola presented in early March and said TIM would continue to explore a tie-up with state-backed broadband rival Open Fiber.
Tim's shares rose as much as 10% to 0.30 euros, after hitting an all-time low of 0.22 euros last week as investors unwound bets on KKR's 0.505 euros per share offer ever materialising.
KKR, which has been waiting almost four months for a response to its preliminary approach, declined to comment.
TIM's largest shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) has slammed the offer as too low and the group on Sunday said there was ""untapped value"" in TIM to be considered when weighing alternatives to Labriola's plan.
The long-mooted Open Fiber merger could provide a 1 euro boost to TIM's shares according to internal calculations, sources familiar with the matter have said.
LABRIOLA'S PLAN
Labriola, who got the top job in January with Vivendi's backing, has said his plan is similar to KKR's project. By executing it in-house, TIM would benefit from the gains the private equity firm targets in its turnaround efforts, he said.
Labriola's plan entails separating TIM's services arm from its infrastructure assets, a move that would ease a combination of TIM's network with that of Open Fiber, creating a single wholesale-only broadband provider.
To this end, TIM said it would continue discussions with CDP, Italy's state investor which controls Open Fiber but is also TIM's second-biggest shareholder.
""The KKR potential offer remains the lower probability outcome here,"" Exane BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) analysts said.
""The company are making sure they follow the correct procedures to ensure that they cannot be accused in the future of neglecting shareholders in the future.""
Minority investors in TIM had complained about the company snubbing KKR's offer altogether, and independent directors had also expressed concerns.
Sources have said TIM could seek to reach a compromise with KKR whereby the fund plays a role in the asset revamp without seeking to take control of the group. KKR has already invested 1.8 billion euros in TIM's last-mile network for a 37.5% stake.
TIM had hoped to secure a preliminary agreement with CDP over Open Fiber in time for Sunday's board meeting but discussions over a tie-up that raises competition issues at the European level will require longer, sources have said.
""Management have shifted message ... and are now pushing the Open Fiber merger angle once again,"" Exane BNP Paribas said.

""In the short term the hope of 'something' happening is probably enough to continue to draw a line under the shares.""

The new target is 14% lower than the previous one of $115.
“Our downgrade does not reflect a change in our long-term view of Tyson’s ability to affect internal change through its actions, operational improvements, or capacity expansions, but rather our disciplined approach and a potential reduction to underlying fundamentals outside chicken, particularly beef,” BMO analyst Kenneth Zaslow said in a note.
Zaslow expects lower beef packer margins to offset the improvement in the chicken business.
Tyson is up 16% in the last year compared to just 6.6% gains in S&P 500.

During his tenure at the Austria-based unit, Magna Steyr, Klein oversaw its shift to the electric mobility manufacturing space, including the production of the first electric vehicle made by a contract manufacturer, Rivian said on Monday.
He previously served in various management positions at German carmaker  Daimler  AG (DE:MBGn) for nearly three decades and was responsible for setting up the Mercedes-Benz plant in Kecskemét, Hungary.
Klein will be based in Normal, Illinois, where Rivian currently produces its vehicles. The company last year said it would locate its second U.S-based manufacturing facility in Georgia. Production at the Georgia plant is slated for 2024.
Rivian last week said supply-chain issues could cut its planned production in half in 2022 to 25,000 vehicles. 

Klein succeeds Rod Copes, who retired in December.

Earlier this month, Prada said it had suspended its retail operations in Russia, following a slew of other leading brands, after the European Union and many countries imposed strict economic sanctions on Russia in a response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Russia accounted for around 2% of Prada's total sales in 2021, it said on Monday. 
Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in 2021 jumped to 489 million euros ($535.85 million) from 20 million euros a year earlier and well above the 307 million posted in 2019, before the COVID outbreak. 
Analysts expected a 429 million euro operating profit, according to a Refinitiv consensus.
""Prada Group's start to 2022 has been strong. Our long-term strategy is on track,"" CEO Patrizio Bertelli said in a statement adding he was confident to meet medium-term targets, ""even though it is difficult to predict the impact of the Ukraine conflict on the global economy"". 
The Milan-based, Hong Kong-listed group said it would propose a dividend of 7 euro cents per share, with a payout ratio of 61%. 
The fashion house in January said that sales last year bounced above pre-pandemic levels to 3.36 billion euros. 
In November the group posted a medium-term revenue goal of 4.5 billion euros and said it targeted an operating profit of 20% of total sales in the medium term. 
Last year, operating profit was 14.5% of total sales, up from 9.5% in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic. 
Prada, known for its minimalist designs, was in the middle of a shift upmarket and online to revive sales when the coronavirus crisis hit, forcing retailers to shut stores around the globe and depriving them of tourist spending.

But like other luxury groups, the family-owned company has emerged strongly from the pandemic thanks to a desire among cooped-up consumers to pamper themselves with high-end purchases.

“We must remember how much money has already been lost by investors who had substantial amounts of stocks in Russia and then those who lost money on the Chinese stocks impacted by the Chinese government crackdown,” Mobius wrote in an emailed response to questions.
His comments come as China’s close ties with Russia are emerging as another risk for investors in the Asian nation’s stocks, which have already been battered by Beijing’s regulatory crackdown. Panic selling gripped the market on Monday, with a gauge of Hong Kong-listed Chinese shares tumbling the most since 2008. The rout followed a report that cited U.S. officials as saying that Russia has asked China for military assistance for its war in Ukraine.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian rejected the reports of the Russian request as “disinformation” and “malicious.”
Tech stocks were once again at the forefront of the losses in Hong Kong on Monday, with the Hang Seng Tech Index sinking a record 11%. That’s after the Golden Dragon Index, which tracks American depository receipts of Chinese firms, plunged 10% for two consecutive days last week -- a first in its 22-year history.
The selloff in ADRs “can get worse if there are implications for China as regards to Russian sanctions,” wrote Mobius, who set up Mobius Capital Partners after more than three decades at Franklin Templeton Investments. “But that whole story is up in the air in this case.”

Musk in a tweet on Sunday also asked about inflation rate outlook and said his companies ""are not alone"", retweeting an article saying the Ukraine-Russia conflict sent commodity prices to their highest levels since 2008.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has led to a surge in prices of metals used in cars - from aluminum in the bodywork to palladium in catalytic converters to the high-grade nickel in electric vehicle batteries - and customers are likely to foot the bill.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX were not available for additional comments. 
Soaring raw material prices has raised concerns about EV economics, as legacy automakers and startups prepare to launch new cars this year after overcoming problems related to chip shortages.
Additionally, geopolitical challenges arising from Ukraine's invasion have affected factory operations in the United States and made it difficult for raw material suppliers to quote prices.
""Just as hopes the semi-conductor shortage was easing... the invasion has thrown up fresh disruptions to the supply of essential materials and a worrying surge in prices,""  Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Susannah Streeter said. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analysts noted that prices of nickel, a key material used in batteries, were up 130%, while cobalt, lithium and aluminum surged 16% to 88% this year.

Tesla last week raised prices of its popular SUVs and sedans in China and the United States by $1,000. Rivian Automotive Inc warned it would cut its planned production in half, while  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp said it would scale back production due to supply-chain issues.

Investing.com – Turquoise Hill (NYSE:TRQ) stock surged 30% in premarket Monday after Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO) offered to buy the 49% stake it doesn’t already own in the company.
At C$34 in cash offer (around $26.5), Turquoise Hill is valued at about C$6.84 billion.
No agreement has been reached between the parties, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result from these discussions, Rio Tinto said.
The company’s purchase is expected to breathe life into its much delayed Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project in Mongolia. The proposed transaction follows the recent agreement reached amongst the companies and the Mongolian government to move the project forward.
Rio had in December agreed to write off a $2.3 billion loan to the Mongolian government as part of its plans to accelerate work on the project. The Mongolian government owns 34% of the project company, with the rest held by Turquoise Hill. The financing agreement for the mine was signed in 2015 but the project has been mired in controversy since its inception. Mongolian politicians have often called for the original investment agreement to be renegotiated.
Oyu Tolgoi is one of the largest deposits of copper in the world. Its proximity to the Chinese market, which accounts for over half of global copper consumption, gives the project a particular appeal, given China's status as the world's largest electric vehicle market.
EVs routinely require three to four times more copper than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.
According to a Reuters report, Mongolian Prime Minister Oyun-Erdene Luvsannamsrai has committed to completing the expanded underground section of the mine by 2023."

PARIS (Reuters) - Gucci owner  Kering  (PA:PRTP) is bolstering its high-end eyewear division with a deal to buy U.S.-based label Maui Jim, the French luxury group said Monday. 
European luxury companies have shown growing interest in the eyewear business and have tightened their grip on production capacity amid strong demand for luxury products.
Kering, which bought upscale Danish label Lindberg in July last year, expects the Maui Jim deal to be closed in the second half of 2022.
""This has been a sought-after brand for years and it's a significant achievement for (Kering) to add this to its growing portfolio, making it now, by some distance, the (No.) 1 high-end player globally in the space,"" Jefferies said in a research note.
Kering said the purchase of the Hawaiian eyewear label, known for high-end sunglasses, would push the group's annual eyewear revenues above 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) and improve its profitability.
The value of the deal was not disclosed, but Exane BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) said the purchase price likely came to around 1.5 billion euros, estimating Maui Jim’s annual sales at around 300 million euros with operating profit of around 20% in 2021. 
The analysts peg the profitability of Kering’s eyewear division at between 13% and 15%.
Kering began building an in-house eyewear division in 2014, and wholesale revenues exceeded 700 million euros in 2021.
It makes glasses for its own labels including Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Gucci, as well as Richemont brands Cartier, Dunhill and Chloe, among others. 
The group intends to expand Maui Jim’s presence in Europe and Asia, including through the travel retail channel, and use its lens technology to develop corrective sunglasses for fashion labels, Kering Eyewear's president and chief executive Roberto Vedovotto said in a call with reporters.

Rival LVMH said in December last year it was taking over Thelios, the upscale Italian eyewear manufacturer it launched with Marcolin in 2017.

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 07:01AM ET</span>","AT&T, One America News to keep ad deal even after DirecTV drops network","By John Shiffman
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T’s financial relationship with One America News is deeper than previously known and will continue even after DirecTV drops the far-right network from its satellite service next month, a new court filing shows.
The court filing, made as part of a lawsuit OAN filed against AT&T (NYSE:T) and DirecTV last week, reveals an exclusive contract for an AT&T subsidiary to sell commercials for OAN.
AT&T owns 70% of DirecTV, which announced in January it would drop OAN, a network known for promoting false 2020 election reports. The move came three months after Reuters revealed that AT&T played a pivotal role in creating OAN and has paid tens of millions of dollars to carry the network on DirecTV.
To read the Reuters Special Report, click https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oneamerica-att
OAN’s lawsuit, which seeks $1 billion in damages, alleges that the removal of the network from the satellite service was politically inspired and “could be devastating” financially. Court records show that about 90% of OAN’s revenue is generated from its AT&T/DirecTV deals.
Robert Herring Sr, founder and CEO of San Diego-based Herring Networks, which owns OAN, did not respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit was filed March 7 by Herring Networks on behalf of OAN in state court in San Diego.
DirecTV and AT&T did not respond to specific queries from Reuters about the advertising pact, but issued statements about OAN’s lawsuit.
“These allegations are completely without merit,” AT&T said. The telecommunications giant denied OAN’s claim that the political beliefs of executives influenced the decision to drop the network. DirecTV called the lawsuit “baseless” and said it was “confident that we have fully complied both with the law and our agreement.”
After the Reuters report ran last year, AT&T issued a statement that said it “has never had a financial interest in OAN’s success.”
But the new lawsuit alleges that in addition to helping to create and distribute OAN, AT&T entered into the advertising deal with the network in 2019.
Under that deal, an AT&T subsidiary called Xandr is OAN’s sole advertising vendor and earns a commission on commercials aired by the network, the lawsuit alleges. A pending sale of Xandr to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will not include the portion of the company that sells commercials for DirecTV or OAN.
After DirecTV drops OAN, said a person familiar with the contract, the AT&T subsidiary will continue to serve as the advertising representative for OAN on other platforms, such as regional cable companies and cable and internet provider Verizon (NYSE:VZ) FIOS.
The pact to sell commercials is separate from the deal to air OAN on DirecTV, and does not expire until 2024.
In the lawsuit, Herring alleged that AT&T’s decision to drop OAN from DirecTV is “part and parcel of a larger, coordinated, extremely well-financed political scheme to take down Herring and unlawfully destroy its ability to operate in the media business.”
The business relationship between OAN and AT&T has become fodder for political activists on all sides.
Following the Reuters report about AT&T’s role in OAN’s creation, the NAACP and left-wing groups called for DirecTV to stop airing OAN. After DirecTV announced in January it would drop OAN, former President Donald Trump honored Herring at a rally and asked supporters who use DirecTV to cancel their subscriptions.
“It is a very popular channel, far more popular than most would understand, and they are being treated horribly by the Radical Left lunatics,” Trump said in a February statement.
In the lawsuit, Herring said OAN ranks in the top 10% of DirecTV programming, ahead of CNBC, Newsmax and CNN Headline News. Reuters could not independently verify this claim, and TV ratings services do not release OAN figures.
Herring, who amassed a fortune as a tech entrepreneur, launched OAN in 2013. His family-owned Herring Networks also owns a lifestyle and entertainment channel called AWE.
In the lawsuit, Herring said AT&T has earned “generous commissions via selling advertising on AWE and OAN.” The advertising deal called for AT&T to sell both traditional commercials, which every viewer sees, and targeted ads, which are tailored “to the individual viewer based on data known about the viewer.” The court filings don’t say how much revenue AT&T has garnered from the ad deal.
OAN alleged that after AT&T signed the advertising contract in 2019, the network “reasonably expected” this was “proof of a commitment” for a long term DirecTV deal, at least until 2024, when the ad contract expires. DirecTV’s decision to drop OAN, the lawsuit said, “stunned” Herring and damaged its reputation.

“AT&T and DirecTV signaled to the public that something was wrong, hurting OAN’s business and standing in the news media business,” the lawsuit said.
This is not the first time Herring has sued AT&T. In 2016, a Herring lawsuit alleged that AT&T reneged on an oral agreement to air OAN on DirecTV, a contention AT&T denied. About a month after that lawsuit was settled in 2017, OAN began airing on DirecTV.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) included two Hengchi models made by the unit of heavily indebted property developer China Evergrande Group in a catalogue of electric vehicles it said were recommended for ""promotion and application"".
Electric vehicle models added to this catalogue are deemed eligible for subsidies and can be put on sale. The MIIT statement showed the approval was granted on March 8. 
Evergrande NEV would start selling the cars as soon as April, a person familiar with the matter said.
Without giving figures, the person said the sales target was not too high this year due to production constraints but would rise quickly next year.
China Evergrande Group declined to comment. 
Reuters reported in December that Evergrande NEV had started mass production of its Hengchi 5 SUV ahead of schedule.

The firm, a major unit of China Evergrande Group, has been struggling to secure external investment. [nL1N2TF0EF

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 06:36AM ET</span>","U.S. step to delist Chinese ADRs worsens investment, listing outlook","By Xie Yu and Selena Li
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator's move to identify Chinese firms likely to be delisted from New York for not meeting auditing requirements is pushing more fund managers to exit their holdings and dimming the prospect for new listings in the near term.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week identified for the first time five Chinese companies, including KFC operator Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC), that could face delisting.
The move, amid a long-running auditing standoff between U.S. and Chinese regulators, revived fears among investors and triggered a massive sell-off in Chinese companies' American depositary receipts (ADRs).
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) estimates that U.S. institutional investors currently hold around $200 billion of exposure to Chinese ADRs.
Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms.
""The whole sector is becoming uninvestable ... we simply will give up and get out of any U.S.-listed Chinese companies for now,"" said a portfolio manager with a major New York-based hedge fund. 
The fund started offloading Chinese ADRs since late 2019, and plans to sell off any remaining holdings in the coming weeks, said the portfolio manager, who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index, which tracks Chinese companies traded on Wall Street, fell more than 10% for two consecutive days since last Thursday, extending its losses since the start of the year to 34%. The index shed 43% in 2021.
Those with less exposure to U.S.-listed Chinese firms are weighing other options to stay invested in China.
""We have minimal long exposure to ADRs and have been net short ADRs,"" said Ken Xu, chief investment officer of Strategic Vision Investment, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund with more than $1 billion in assets under management.
Xu expects more headwinds for ADRS and has gone long instead on China's onshore shares, seeing significantly higher growth potential in some segments backed by policy support.
The renewed concerns about Chinese companies listed in the United States also comes at a time when appetite for risky assets has been dampened by rising geopolitical risks and a subdued growth outlook for the world's second-largest economy.
China-focused asset manager Krane Funds Advisors said its $4.9 billion KraneShare CSI China Internet ETF aims to convert all Chinese ADRs in its portfolio into their Hong Kong shares in the coming months.
KraneShares, however, said on Friday it expects that a compromise between U.S. and Chinese regulators on the auditing issue was ""still attainable"".
China's securities regulator also gave investors a measure of assurance on Friday saying it was confident it would reach an agreement with U.S. counterparts to solve the auditing dispute.
The regulatory uncertainty may further deter new listings of Chinese companies in New York, bankers say, with the outlook on fundraising clouded by uncertainties about the auditing requirements as well as China's new rules on offshore listings.

Yingjie Weng, New York-based managing director of Special Purpose Acquisition Company investment banking at Chardan, told Reuters the outlook for future listings of Chinese companies in the United States remains uncertain. 
Companies that adopt a complicated offshore holding structure, widely used to circumvent foreign investment restrictions, are unlikely to win SEC approval, she added.

Annual inspections by the Reserve Bank of India found that the company’s servers were sharing information with China-based entities that indirectly own a stake in Paytm Payments Bank, the person said, asking not to be identified as the details are private. Paytm Payments Bank is a joint venture between Paytm and its founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma. China’s  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and its affiliate, Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co., own shares of Paytm, according to exchange filings.
An email to the RBI wasn’t immediately answered. Paytm didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. 
In a statement late Friday, the RBI had cited “material supervisory concerns” for its action, without elaborating. Shares of Paytm, formally known as One 97 Communications Ltd., tumbled as much as 14.7% Monday.
While the RBI had similarly punished companies including  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Banking Corp. and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). for flouting data-storage rules, the concerns around Paytm Payments Bank are particularly sensitive given India’s hostile political relationship with China. 
India has banned hundreds of apps linked to or originating from China over the past two years following a bloody clash at the nations’ disputed border. Paytm Payments Bank, being a regulated financial institution, was required to maintain a so-called service level agreement with its technology vendor that would ringfence the entity from its owners, the person said. 
Paytm Payments Bank had also onboarded thousands of clients without adequate know-your-customer documentation and the concern was that some of these could have been mules for money laundering, the person added. 
The regulator now wants Paytm Payments Bank to appoint a technology auditor in consultation with the RBI, the person said. The company is taking steps to comply with the RBI’s directive, including the appointment of an external auditor, the company said in a statement on Saturday. Existing customers will be unaffected.
The punishment will make it tough for Paytm Payments Bank to be upgraded to a small finance bank, limiting its ability to attract large deposits, according to Macquarie Capital analyst Suresh Ganapathy. ICICI Securities Ltd. cut its price target on Paytm to to 1,285 rupees from 1,352 rupees. The stock was trading at 680 rupees as of 3 p.m. in Mumbai Monday. 
Paytm Payments Bank has over 300 million wallets and 60 million bank accounts, according to its website. The bank said it has over 100 million KYC-compliant customers and has been adding 0.4 million users every month.

(Reuters) -Sanofi's shares slid 5% on Monday after a drug candidate to fight a common type of breast cancer failed to slow progression of the disease in a clinical trial, knocking confidence in the French drugmaker's drug development prowess.
Results from the Phase II AMEERA-3 clinical trial, keenly awaited by  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) investors, showed the drug amcenestrant, given as a pill, did not have the desired effect when compared to standard endocrine treatment against locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, Sanofi said in a statement.
The stock's decline was the biggest on the French bluechip index CAC40 index, which was up 1.8 % at 0920 GMT.
Sanofi said it would continue with two further trials, AMEERA-5 and AMEERA-6, trying to show amcenestrant could help much larger patient groups of women in early stages of cancer.
JP Morgan analysts said Monday's read-out bode ill for those follow-up trials, saying in a note that the ""data will increase the risk in investors' minds"".
The setback puts more pressure on Sanofi to revive its drug development success rate, after it fell far behind in the race to develop COVID-19 vaccines. 
""Today’s negative result is likely to dent sentiment around Sanofi’s pipeline,"" the JP Morgan analysts added.
Amcenestrant belongs to a drug class known as selective oestrogen receptor degraders (SERD) to fight tumours that grow in response to oestrogen, which are estimated to account for up to 80% of all breast cancer cases.
It has the same mode of action as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s injectable Faslodex, also known as fulvestrant, and a range of generic copy products on the market, but a pill would be a more convenient option for patients than painful monthly shots.
The market opportunity for oral SERDs has attracted a range of drugmakers, with Roche, AstraZeneca and Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS) Inc in partnership with Italy’s Menarini Group working on similar pills. 

Faslodex sales were $431 million in 2021, down 26% as cheaper copies take hold, but analysts have described a future oral SERDs market as a multi-billion dollar opportunity. 
Shares in Oral SERD contender Radius Health soared last October after it announced positive results from its late-stage study.

Goldman economists in a note on Friday trimmed their year-end target for the benchmark index to 4,700 from 4,900, which would have implied a nearly 3% rise in 2022. Goldman's target still implies a nearly 12% jump for the S&P from current levels.

Investing.com –  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) ADRs traded 2.5% lower in premarket Monday after an experimental cancer medicine failed to slow the progression of a common type of breast cancer.
The patients who got the drug, rather than endocrine treatment, didn’t live longer without the disease progressing, according to Sanofi.
The oral pill amcenestrant was one of six “potentially transformative” products Sanofi has touted and prioritized and was seen as the French drugmaker’s next blockbuster.
Hopes were also high from the drug, given most of the alternatives in the market are painful injections.
The disappointing result doesn’t mean it’s the end of the road for amcenestrant, but it increases the risk of failure for the other trials, according to analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence.
In the Phase II trial, the patients had advanced disease and few treatment options remaining, and the medicine wasn’t combined with another as is often the case in cancer. The company said it would press ahead with other trials.
Other trials of the drug include one called AMEERA-5, an advanced study in which it’s combined with Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) IBRANCE as a first line treatment for breast cancer that has spread."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Staff turnover on Wall Street is set to surge in coming weeks as investment bankers who held off job-hunting during the pandemic cash in their record bonus checks and leave for new opportunities in the red-hot labor market, said recruiters.
Bonuses are up 20% to 25% on average across Wall Street thanks to last year's deal-making frenzy, but bankers have been waiting for the checks to hit their accounts -- which typically happens each year between January and March -- to jump ship.
While bonus payouts usually trigger staff turnover, recruiters and experts say 2022 could see twice as much churn as usual due to a confluence of factors: many bankers felt it was too risky to job hop during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now burnt out after working grueling hours on last year's deal bonanza. 
The tight U.S. labor market has also created huge opportunities for bankers and pushed up salaries.
""We have been telling our clients for over a year now that they would have a 'double year' in 2022 in terms of turnover,"" said Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a Wall Street compensation consultancy. 
""You're getting two years' worth of people who wanted to quit.""
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) paid bumper bonuses for 2021, with Goldman increasing top-performing bankers' incentive compensation by 40% to 50% and JPMorgan by 30% to 40%, Reuters reported. 
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) raised that figure by more than 20%. Overall, 2021 bonuses on average rose by 20%-25%, Johnson Associates estimated.
That jump was largely thanks to U.S. deal volumes nearly doubling to $2.61 trillion in 2021, according to Dealogic, as corporations rushed to raise funds and take advantage of record share prices to snap up acquisitions.
Market volatility this year, which has been compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has weighed on dealmaking generally and dampened CEO sentiment toward taking companies public. With chances for big 2022 bonuses reduced, some investment bankers have little incentive to stick with their current roles, recruiters added. 
This is especially true for workers who may be considering jobs outside banking, such as in Silicon Valley, where many former finance executives have found lucrative opportunities.
PAIN FOR SOME, GAIN FOR OTHERS
The pain will be felt most by banks whose staff believe they were paid less than their peers, said one New York-based recruiter who works placing analysts and associates.
Those junior bankers, who support senior dealmakers, have been quick to circulate complaints about their pay and working conditions, including 100-plus hour work weeks, on social media, pressuring Wall Street employers to raise their compensation.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) are two banks likely to suffer, said the recruiter who asked not to be named discussing sensitive pay issues.
""Litquidity,"" a popular Instagram and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) account run by an anonymous financial services worker, in late January posted comments it said were from Citigroup first-year analysts complaining their 2021 bonuses were ""significantly lower"" than rival banks. 
Citigroup declined to comment. 
Scandal-hit Swiss lender Credit Suisse meanwhile was so worried about retaining top talent that it boosted immediate cash payouts for senior bankers, provided they stuck around for three years. 
Credit Suisse declined to comment, although the bank has recently made some senior investment banking hires.
""The banks that didn't pay above average are going to lose a lot of talent and are probably going to struggle to recruit new talent,"" said the recruiter, adding that some junior bankers are now beginning their job hunt just six months into their current role. 

However, turnover works both ways, experts and executives said.
""This is the recruiting moment,"" said Marc Cooper, chief executive of the boutique investment bank Solomon Partners. ""We have plenty of offers out, we'll see what happens.""

1097,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 06:16AM ET</span>",Rhode Island takes Teva to trial in multibillion-dollar opioid case,"By Dietrich Knauth
(Reuters) - Rhode Island is set to square off on Monday against Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) Ltd, as a multibillion-dollar trial begins over whether the Israeli company contributed to an opioid crisis that has caused more than 500,000 deaths over the past two decades.
Rhode Island says Teva created a ""public nuisance"" by downplaying the risks of opioid addiction and promoting the off-label use of powerful fentanyl-based opioids that were approved only for certain types of cancer pain.
Rhode Island is seeking $5.9 billion from the companies, according to a Teva court filing. Rhode Island officials declined to comment on the specific amount. 
Teva subsidiaries  Actavis  (NYSE:AGN) Pharma and Cephalon Inc are also defendants in the case in Rhode Island Superior Court in Providence.
The companies have denied the allegations, saying they sold drugs that were legal and approved for pain treatment.
In court filings by Teva, it calls Rhode Island's lawsuit an improper attempt to blame a wide-ranging public health crisis on ""a small subset of opioid manufacturers"" that make ""niche"" medicines like Actiq and Fentora. According to Teva's filings, those cancer drugs account for just 0.02% percent of all opioid prescriptions in the state since 1998.
The company also sells generic opioids such as oxycodone.
The Rhode Island lawsuit is one of more than 3,300 filed by state, local and Native American tribal governments across the country accusing drugmakers of minimizing the addictiveness of opioid pain medications. The lawsuits also accuse distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that the drugs were being diverted into illegal channels.
The trial will begin as Teva attempts to negotiate a nationwide settlement of its opioid liability. After a recent $225 million settlement with the state of Texas, Teva Chief Executive Kåre Schultz told Reuters the company will likely end up paying $2.7 billion to $3.6 billion to resolve opioid claims.
Other defendants in the Rhode Island case settled before trial, including drug distributors McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp and  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), which joined a nationwide $21 billion settlement.
Purdue Pharma LP, which was also a defendant, won initial approval last week for a $6 billion settlement funded by its Sackler family owners that would resolve litigation over its role in the opioid crisis.
The public nuisance theory has been used with mixed results in cases against other opioid distributors, manufacturers and pharmacies. 
The Rhode Island trial comes more than two months after a New York jury found Teva liable for creating a public nuisance in the state. And a federal jury in November found that pharmacy chain operators CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) Inc and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc created a public nuisance in two Ohio counties, in the first trial against those companies over the opioid epidemic. 

Damages have not yet been decided in either the New York or Ohio cases.

The deal is part of a multi-year restructuring by HSBC, which included axing its loss-making U.S. retail bank last year.
HSBC said the in-principle agreement to sell its Greek retail business by its HSBC Continental Europe unit was expected to complete in the first half of 2023. 
HSBC, which has operated in Greece since 1981, has assets of around 2 billion euros ($2.19 billion) in the country.
The bank said it served 90,000 retail customers and around 500 business customers through 15 branches in Greece.
All 320 employees of the retail business will transfer to Pancreta as part of the sale once completed.

Investing.com – Tencent Holdings stock (OTC:TCEHY) (HK:0700) closed nearly 10% lower in Hong Kong Monday on a report in The Wall Street Journal that the Chinese tech giant faces a potential record fine for violations of some central bank regulations by its WeChat Pay mobile network.
The violations relate to China’s anti-money-laundering rules. According to WSJ, there were also lapses in compliance with ‘know your customer’ and ‘know your business’ regulations – rules implemented by regulators the world over that require entities to verify the authenticity of the customer and their eligibility to undertake that transaction on the platform.
The breaches were discovered by the country’s central bank during a routine inspection that concluded in late 2021. Tencent’s mobile payments network was also found to have allowed the transfer and laundering of funds with illicit transactions such as gambling, the report said.
The impending penalty comes as Chinese fintech platforms prepare for tighter oversight of their business amid the government’s attempts to curb money laundering activities.
The Dutch-listed shares of  Prosus  (AS:PRX), the vehicle that holds South African giant Naspers' Tencent stake, were hurt too. They fell 11% in Amsterdam. NYSE-listed shares of Tencent Music Entertainment (NYSE:TME), a subsidiary, were down 5.2% in premarket trading.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Monday on raised hopes for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine war, but investors remain wary as fighting continues, a number of central banks hold meetings this week and Covid returns to China.
By 4:10 AM ET (0810 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France traded 1.1% higher and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.3%.
The next round of the talks on the war in Ukraine between the two principals takes place Monday, but the noises emerging from the last session were reasonably upbeat.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman said on Sunday that Russia was showing signs it might be willing to have substantive negotiations, while Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said Russia was ""beginning to talk constructively."" 
That said, despite the optimistic tone, the fighting rages on near Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, following Sunday’s bombardment by Russia of a large training base near the border with NATO member Poland on Sunday.
U.S. officials claimed over the weekend that Russia had asked China for military assistance, potentially heightening the diplomatic tensions significantly. The U.S. and China plan to hold their first high-level, in-person talks since Moscow’s invasion later Monday.
Another factor prompting caution was China’s decision to place the over 17 million residents of Shenzhen, the country’s technology hub, into lockdown for at least a week after Covid cases soared once more. 
This has the potential to weigh heavily on economic growth in China, as well as further disrupt global supply chains.
Elsewhere, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate hike since 2018 on Wednesday as policymakers try to balance the twin threats of inflation, which is running at a four-decade high, and economic uncertainty arising from the war in Ukraine. 
The Bank of England is also expected to hike rates again this week, while central banks in Japan, Turkey, and Brazil will also hold meetings.

""We are pretty realistic that over a month, two month period this will come to a gradual, if not normal phasing out of the business,"" CEO Thierry Vanlancker said about Akzo's Russian operations.
""It's either because the raw materials aren't available anymore, or it is because somewhere the main customer may not be able to pay.""
The products Akzo produces for retail and industrial clients in Russia do not fall under any sanctions regime, company spokeswoman Diana Abrahams told Reuters.
However, she said the company's supply chain in Russia was being affected by the impact of the war in Ukraine and sanctions imposed by Western countries against Russia.
""... it is clear that even products that are not sanctioned are and will be hit. The whole chain from supplies to customers is disrupted,"" she said.

Abrahams said Akzo looks on a daily basis to see what it can do to help its 640 employees in Russia and its staff of 17 in Ukraine, without giving further details.

MILAN (Reuters) -Telecom Italia said on Sunday it would start formal talks with KKR to assess the U.S. fund's potential 10.8 billion euro ($11.8 billion) offer for Italy's biggest phone group, almost four months after the approach.
 Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM), however, said it would also explore a possible tie-up with state-backed broadband rival Open Fiber as it pursues an in-house revamp new CEO Pietro Labriola presented in early March.
Discussions with KKR to assess ""the attractiveness and deliverability"" of its proposal would also seek to define the ""length and scope"" of confirmatory due diligence the private equity firm had requested before formalising its non-binding bid, TIM said. 
KKR aims to secure control of the debt-laden former phone monopoly, delist it and attempt to relaunch it by carving out its network infrastructure assets, sources have previously said.
Labriola, whose appointment was sponsored by TIM's largest investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) which deems KKR's initial offer as too low, has presented his own plan to revive the company. Labriola's plan also centres on separating network assets from TIM's services arm.
""TIM's board confirmed the will to execute the business plan and explore the revamp, through a reorganisation of the group's operations and a possible integration with Open Fiber,"" the company said in a statement released after a special board meeting on Sunday.
""The board also confirmed the conviction there is hidden value in TIM ... which must be taken into due consideration when assessing any alternatives to the business plan.""
TIM said Labriola and Chairman Salvatore Rossi would hold formal talks with KKR, following informal contacts between advisers in recent months, to gather more details on the KKR proposals.
TIM has recorded falling revenue and shrinking margins in recent years amid cut-throat competition in its core domestic market. Its shares last week hit an all-time low after the company reported a record 2021 loss and Labriola unveiled his revamp plan.
KKR's bid of 0.505 euros a share is a 75% premium to the stock's closing level on Friday, compared with a 46% premium when it was first announced.
Italy's government, which has special powers to shield companies of strategic relevance for the country such as TIM from unwanted foreign interest, is yet to take a formal stance on KKR's proposal.
The U.S. fund has said it wanted the backing of both TIM and the government. KKR is already involved with TIM, having paid 1.8 billion euros last year for a 37.5% stake in its secondary network.
OPEN FIBER TALKS
Rome has become the second biggest investor in TIM through state lender CDP, which owns 60% of Open Fiber, to oversee TIM's fixed line assets - Italy's biggest telecoms infrastructure.
TIM said it would continue negotiations with CDP and discussions with all relevant authorities over the Open Fiber merger, which would create a single broadband champion in Italy.
TIM had hoped to secure a preliminary agreement with CDP over Open Fiber in time for Sunday's board meeting but discussions over a tie-up that raises regulatory issues will require longer, sources have said.
In an attempt to revive the tie-up with Open Fiber, Labriola has said TIM is ready to relinquish a majority of its prized fixed landline assets.

A merger with Open Fiber could provide TIM's investors with an upside of 1 euro a share versus the current set up, sources have previously said.

There's arguably never a good time for the COVID-19 pandemic to make a comeback but the surging cases in China over the weekend come at a moment when the global economy could do without another layer of stress to its already stretched supply chains.
Ukraine's two leading providers of neon, which produce about half the world's supply of the key ingredient for making chips, have halted operations, threatening to raise prices and to aggravate the semiconductor shortage.
This morning, Chinese stocks fell as domestic COVID-19 cases jumped to a two-year high, prompting Beijing's technology and financial hubs to impose restrictions. 
How severe the outbreak will prove and how much pain it will bring to the global economy is anyone's guess, but the economic fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine is already taking a heavy toll. 
Analysts have started trimming corporate earnings' estimates and on Thursday, the European Central Bank cut its 2022 growth target to 3.7% from 4.2% while raising its inflation forecast to 5.1%.
This week all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve and U.S. producer price index (PPI) data expected to show an annual 10% jump on Tuesday, will set the stage nicely for a rate hike. 
A quick look at the fast-ascending popularity of search queries for 'stagflation' on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trends confirms that central banks hawks and doves are not the only ones worrying about sky-rocketing oil prices and higher rates slowing the economy.
In the meantime, both the pan-European STOXX 600 and Wall Street's S&P 500 are down over 11% year-to-date but this morning futures are pointing to a positive start of the week. 
With low visibility on the macro front, trading these past weeks has focused on news from the war in Ukraine and on diplomatic efforts to put an end to it. 
On Friday, stocks jumped when Russian President Vladimir Putin noted ""certain positive shifts"" in the negotiations and investors and trading algorithms will be on the lookout for any sign that the crisis could somehow de-escalate as talks continue today.
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Monday:
- India's February WPI inflation accelerates to 13.11% y/y

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 03:00AM ET</span>",Defence firms ramp up pitch to exit sustainability wilderness,"By Simon Jessop, Tommy Wilkes and Tim Hepher
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) -Largely ignored by the growing ranks of Europe's socially minded investors, defence firms see a fresh chance to argue for a place in portfolios after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
One asset manager announced last week that it would re-allow investment in defence, a sign that cracks are emerging in widespread opposition to owning defence firms from sustainable investors in Europe. 
Analysts expect more to follow. But for many with a sustainable tilt - defined by some as investing in companies that aim to have a positive impact on the world - it will prove a tough ask.
Rolls Royce (LON:RR), Thales and Airbus have joined a chorus of companies over the last two weeks calling for investors to treat the sector more favourably, arguing security and stability are key to sustainability.
That comes after a year of the industry lobbying European authorities not to exclude defence from an upcoming framework or ""taxonomy"" on socially good investments. 
It also follows years in which investors across Europe have avoided the sector in favour of firms with stronger environmental, social and governance (ESG) profiles, hurting defence shares and raising financing costs.
Most of the funds focused on sustainability that Reuters has spoken to remain cold on defence. But some are eyeing the returns on offer from the region's push to raise security spending.
Sweden's SEB Investment Management announced last week it had overturned a blanket ban on any company deriving more than 5% of its revenue from defence for six of its funds, although the majority of its product range is unchanged, including sustainable funds.
SEB attributed the change to pressure from customers for exposure to defence as Russian troops amassed on the Ukraine border, underlining that fund houses must answer to clients as well as their own sustainability promises.
""We are seeing evidence that a number of large European asset managers are re-evaluating the sector,"" said Luke Sussams, head of ESG in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for investment bank Jefferies. ""The Ukraine-Russia conflict has been a real wake-up call for ESG investors in general.""
Yet others say the sudden redrawing of Europe's security architecture does not mean makers of fighters, missiles and tanks are suddenly sustainable.
""Sustainable investments must fulfil the criterion ""Do no significant harm"" – this is not the case with armaments,"" said Henrik Pontzen, head of ESG at Union Investment. It is sticking to excluding from its sustainable funds any company that earns more than 5% of revenue from arms.
Sasja Beslik, head of sustainability at Danish pension fund PFA, said investors were wrong if they believed they could ensure that any investment in defence went solely towards defending borders.
""What are we going to include tomorrow? Let's include chemical companies that are polluting certain parts of the world, but not the rest. Come on, it's ridiculous,"" he told Reuters.
While funds with a specific sustainable or ethical mandate may find it hard to change tack, others with a looser requirement to ""integrate ESG risks"" have more flexibility.
Sustainable managers typically avoid businesses that earn 5%-plus of revenue from defence, while the vast majority of risk-focused funds just ban those involved with unconventional weapons such as cluster munitions.
UBS analysts noted that rather than outright exclusions some ESG managers prefer engagement. 
According to Morningstar, sustainable funds have a 0.2% weighting to aerospace and defence against the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF's 1.1%. In Europe the underweighting is starker -- 0.2% against 1.6%.
SOCIALLY GOOD OR BAD?
Still, defence lobbyists believe they are now winning the argument, especially after a strong indication that Europe's drive to help funnel investment to socially and environmentally friendly activities would not exclude their industry. 
A report prepared for the European Commission on its 'Social Taxonomy' last month omitted an earlier reference of defence as socially harmful. Lobbyists had feared it would lead to widespread fund exclusions.
With Germany, Sweden and others announcing bigger defence spending since the war in Ukraine, analysts have rushed to upgrade forecasts and share prices have soared.
Calling ESG concerns ""spurious and morally weak"", Agency Partners said in a note that the EU taxonomy debate had clouded the investability and valuations of defence stocks. 
And French warplane manufacturer Dassault Aviation hit out at a ""schizophrenic"" situation that saw European defence spending rising only for U.S. rivals to benefit, because European suppliers were being harmed by the EU taxonomy drive.
""Taxonomy is not an effective weapon against current threats,"" CEO Eric Trappier, who also represents the French defence industry, told reporters. ""It is a weapon used against us, the defence industry, and the proof is that... its small suppliers are starting to have problems with their banks."" 
FIGHTBACK
The defence industry's fight is far from over, however. 
Including defence in the EU social's taxonomy would ""fly in the face of the 'Do No Significant Harm principle'"", said Hortense Bioy, sustainable research director at Morningstar.
European technical advisers are also backing a 5% revenue threshold to exclude defence companies from the bloc's planned 'EU Ecolabel', which is designed to help consumers identify more environmentally friendly and socially good products.
A spokesperson said the Commission would ""carefully reflect on all the implications of those exclusions for defence-related activities"", but stressed no final decision had been made. 
For a fragmented industry that can struggle to compete against rivals in the United States where ESG concerns are less commonplace, winning hearts and minds of investors is crucial.

""Even if some banks and investors are coming back to defence, it doesn't mean they all are,"" said Jan Pie, secretary general of European defence industry lobby ASD, arguing that longer term, defence needed more reliable financial backers.
""It shouldn't be public opinion that decides whether to finance the defence industry.""

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Deutsche Bank, which faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, said on Friday in a surprise move that it would wind down its business in the country.
Deutsche joins the ranks of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which were the first major U.S. banks to exit after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Those moves put pressure on rivals to follow..
Deutsche had resisted pressure to sever ties, arguing that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in Russia. 
But on Friday evening in Frankfurt, the bank suddenly reversed course.
""We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said.
""There won't be any new business in Russia,"" Deutsche said. 
A day earlier,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Chief Executive Christian Sewing explained to staff why the bank was not withdrawing.
""The answer is that this would go against our values,"" he wrote. ""We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight.""
Bill Browder, an investor who has spent years campaigning to expose corruption in Russia, said that Deutsche Bank staying was ""completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the West.""
""I would be surprised if they are able to maintain this position as the situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate,"" Browder told Reuters earlier on Friday.
The criticism came as Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv were regrouping northwest of the Ukrainian capital and Britain said that Moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days.
Fabio De Masi, a former member of the Bundestag and a prominent campaigner against financial crime, said that Deutsche Bank had close ties to the Russian elite, many of whom faced sanctions and that the relationship, where it involved criminal Russian activity, had to end.
'MONITORING'
Deutsche Bank has said that it has pared down its Russian footprint in recent years. This week it disclosed 2.9 billion euros in credit risk to the country, and said exposure is ""very limited"". 
It also operates a technology centre with about 1,500 employees in Russia and opened a new main office in Moscow in December, which it said at the time represented ""a significant investment and commitment to the Russian market"".
Russia has landed Deutsche Bank in hot water in the past.
The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating it for years over trades that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia, which has led to the German bank being fined nearly $700 million. 
Deutsche Bank said on Friday that the DOJ probe ""is understood to be ongoing"".
The row over Russia came as Deutsche Bank disclosed in its annual report that it paid Sewing 8.8 million euros ($9.68 million) in 2021, a 20% increase from a year earlier. 

Overall, the lender paid 14% more, or 2.1 billion euros, in bonuses for 2021, rewarding staff for the bank's most profitable year in a decade.

1112,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2022 02:35AM ET</span>",Europe's carmakers scramble to replace Ukrainian auto parts,"By Christina Amann and Nick Carey
BERLIN (Reuters) - Carmakers including Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW are scrambling to find alternative sources of vital parts made in Ukraine from as far afield as China and Mexico, as Russia's invasion halts assembly lines and breaks complex supply chains.
The hunt for new supplies is the latest challenge for an auto industry already reeling from soaring metal and energy prices, supply chains snarled by the pandemic, and a shortage of semiconductor chips. 
The fighting in Ukraine has now disrupted output of wire harnesses, which bundle up to 5 km (3.1 miles) of cables in the average car. Unique to each model, vehicles cannot be built without them. 
As a result, world No. 2 automaker Volkwagen and rival BMW have cut output and temporarily closed some assembly lines, while Mercedes-Benz has warned its production will be affected soon.
VW's premium brand Audi said the entire Volkswagen group is working to get major suppliers to relocate their Ukrainian wire harness production to other plants, or find alternative suppliers. That search includes Eastern Europe, North Africa, Mexico and ""possibly"" China, it said.
""We have been working successfully with various suppliers from these regions for our models for years,"" it said. ""It is possible, for example, that suppliers will split production across several locations.""
BMW also said it is in ""intensive talks"" with suppliers to find alternative sources for parts, while world no. 4 carmaker Stellantis said it has already shifted its sourcing from Ukraine to elsewhere in Europe, declining to say where.
Nick Klein, a vice president at global logistics firm OEC Group, said carmakers who have relied on Ukraine will need to move fast.
""You'll need to order way ahead of time, because you'll face delays, and carmakers will be competing against each other for the same sources,"" said Klein, who specialises in automotive logistics.
'MESSED-UP' SUPPLY CHAINS
Western Ukraine, with its low-cost, highly-skilled workforce and proximity to Europe's car factories and a wealth of raw materials, has grown into a major production hub for wire harnesses, with Japan's Fujikura and France's Nexans among those producing there. 
Some manufacturers, like Fujikura, have suspended Ukrainian production altogether since the invasion, while others are operating at reduced capacity. Neither Fujikura nor Nexans replied to requests for comment on their plans.
Moving production to plants in other low-cost markets with a vibrant wire harness industry, like Romania, Serbia or Tunisia, involves buying new equipment to boost capacity, which could take months to install. 
According to industry sources, suppliers and carmakers are discussing who will foot the bill. Carmakers interviewed for this story would not name their suppliers.
Some wire harness manufacturers in Ukraine, such as Kromberg & Schubert, Japan's Yazaki and Leoni, already have alternative plants in other countries. Leoni declined to comment on its plans, and K&S and Yazaki did not respond to requests for comment.
There is still a trickle of supply out of Ukraine. One wire harness manufacturer in the country's west, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for the safety of workers, said some production continues during the day, though it is shuttered at night due to curfews.
Some trucking companies are hauling wire harnesses south across the border into Romania because for now the fighting has not reached that region, OEC Group's Klein said. That could soon change.
""The number of truckers who are willing to drive those routes as this continues will be less and less,"" Klein said. ""There's going to be a point where you can't get anything out of there safely."" 

Facing a ""messed-up"" global supply chain, European carmakers need as many sources of parts as possible, Klein said.
""Right now you cannot have enough suppliers and you cannot have enough shipping partners, because of the climate we're in.""

By Praveen Menon, Min Zhang and Fransiska Nangoy
(Reuters) - Chinese tycoon Xiang Guangda has to find a way to bail his Tsingshan Holding Group out of a crisis after its bet on nickel prices backfired, fuelling more volatility in a metal essential for the electric vehicles industry. One of the world's top nickel producers faces massive losses on its short positions after prices soared over $100,000 per tonne last week and forced the London Metal Exchange to halt nickel trading.
Tsingshan has to either pay off the outstanding short positions, which could be as high as $8 billion, or prove it has sufficient deliverable nickel to repay in kind. 
Beijing could step in to rescue Tsingshan, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. China could swap some of its high grade nickel reserves for low grade nickel pig iron (NPI) that Tsingshan produces to help it meet LME quality standards. China is estimated to hold around 100,000 tonnes of nickel in state stocks, two analysts said.
Tsingshan and China's state reserves administration did not respond to requests for comment.
Tsingshan has figured in market swings before. 
Last year, it triggered a price drop with surprise news that it would provide nickel matte to battery materials makers, potentially solving a key bottleneck for electric vehicles by boosting battery-grade supply in a cheaper way. 
Betting prices would fall, Tsingshan started building a short position last year. The bet backfired partly as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent metals prices soaring, putting pressure on holders of big short positions, including Tsingshan.
""Markets were sensing that (Tsingshan) were going to make a move, but they probably made it too early ... a quarter or so too early and nobody was anticipating what happened in Ukraine,"" said Angela Durrant, Wood Mackenzie's principal nickel analyst.
Tsingshan has suggested foreign elements may be driving up nickel prices. ""Foreigners do have some actions and we are actively co­­ordinating [with related parties],"" China Business News quoted Xiang as saying on March 8. The market gyrations have had no impact on Tsingshan's Indonesia operations, a corporate mining source familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
For Indonesia, Tsingshan is a means to fulfill its ambition to become a one-stop shop for EV battery ingredients and the company has executed projects at lightning speed. Western firms often privately complained about the access and resources Tsingshan got in the country. ""Government has ambition in Indonesia, they want to build the hub for battery for electrical car. That's why you see the policy to support the industry,"" the source said. ""We are affected by COVID, but not affected by this (short exposure)."" Tsingshan is also seen as a poster child in Southeast Asia for China’s Belt and Road Initiative, President Xi Jinping's vast infrastructure programme. 
In contrast to privately-held Tsingshan, several high profile projects led by Chinese state-backed firms have been mothballed amid overpricing, corruption and debt sustainability concerns. https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-belt-road-plans-losing-momentum-opposition-debt-mount-study-2021-09-29
MARKET DISRUPTOR 
Founded in 1988 in Wenzhou, Tsingshan started out in stainless steel production and making automobile windows and doors. 
But its fortunes changed when Xiang, 64, started exploring Indonesian markets in 2009. Over the next decade, it shook the global nickel industry with low-cost nickel pig iron. It set up facilities in Indonesia, the world's largest nickel producer, with output ranging from nickel sulphate to nickel matte, an intermediate product that can be used in both stainless steel and batteries. Tsingshan is spearheading Indonesia’s two major nickel hubs, including the Morowali industrial park, which employs over 40,000 people and spans 2,000 hectares with an airport, mineral processing plants, a port and executive visitors hotel.
The company has said it aims to produce 850,000 tonnes of nickel equivalents this year and 1.1 million tonnes in 2023. ""There was nothing there on that site in 2015 ... so they did something absolutely miraculous,"" Durrant said. ""Getting away from higher Chinese power (costs), moving everything over to Indonesia was a masterstroke for them."" The industry credits much of this success to Xiang. He became known as a market disruptor who could ""take the world by storm"", said Steven Brown, an independent nickel consultant in Canberra who spent two days touring Tsingshan’s production facilities with Xiang in 2014. 
Xiang opposes high nickel prices and is fixed on being a low-cost producer of nickel and stainless steel, Brown said. 
""I don't think this crisis will result in too much of a change in strategy from Tsingshan,"" he added. 
Market sources said though Tsingshan has cut its exposure it is unlikely to have fully covered all its positions. 

State-backed Chinese newspaper Securities Daily said on March 9 that Tsingshan had deployed ""enough spot products"" for delivery by swapping its nickel matte with nickel plates in the domestic market.
The LME allows delivery of nickel cathodes, including plate, and briquettes. ""There isn't much spot nickel product in the market, it's not even likely that Tsingshan could get 100,000 tonnes,"" said a Guangdong-based analyst who declined to be named.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Monday morning. Inflation risks from commodity-supply disruptions continue, with the U.S. Federal Reserve widely expected to hike interest rates in its latest policy decision.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 gained 0.57% by 10:37 PM ET (2:37 AM GMT) while South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.96%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 jumped 1.13%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 3.16%. China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.78% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.71%.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index sank 10% during the previous week, which dampened the mood in Hong Kong alongside the persistently high number of cases in the city’s fifth wave of COVID-19. China is also dealing with a growing outbreak which put the southern city of Shenzhen under a lockdown.
Chinese data, including fixed-asset investment, industrial production, retail sales, and the unemployment rate, is due on Tuesday.
Global shares eased a selloff driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict continue, with senior U.S. and China officials to meet on Monday for discussions.
However, Russian missiles hit a military training facility in western Ukraine close to Poland and U.S. officials claimed that Russia asked China for military equipment. With Russia losing access to almost half of its foreign exchange reserves, it remains to be seen if the country can continue to service its international debt.
U.S. Treasuries extended a downward trend, with the five-year U.S. yield above 2% for the first time since May 2019. This, and a 12% drop in global stocks this year, continue to drive worries that tightening monetary policy and soaring energy, grain, and metal costs could slow down the economic recovery.
“We are experiencing extraordinary volatility in global equities compounded by wavering market sentiment, and the risk of recession intensifies on spiraling commodity prices,” Federated Hermes portfolio manager for global equities Louise Dudley said in a note.
“We expect ongoing swings in the short term as geopolitical uncertainty over Russian crude persists.”
Investors now await the Fed’s policy decision, due to be handed down on Wednesday. However, the central bank “is really stuck between the real economy and the financial economy,” Bain & Co. global head of macro research Karen Harris told Bloomberg.
“You have mainstream struggling with inflation, that’s why we are set to see these rises coming in March. On the other side, we are trying not to prick the financial economy. Either path is deflationary, recessionary.”
The Bank of England will hand down its policy decision on Thursday, with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel, Governing Council member Ignazio Visco, and Chief Economist Philip Lane speaking at a conference on the same day.

The Hang Seng Tech Index fell as much as 5.1% in early trade, with the sector again at the forefront of losses in Hong Kong and China stocks. The Golden Dragon Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese stocks, plunged 10% on consecutive days last week -- something that’s never happened before in its 22-year history. 
The tumble follows a Friday report that Didi Global Inc. has suspended preparations for its planned Hong Kong listing after failing to appease regulatory demands, reigniting fears over Beijing’s crackdown.

LONDON (Reuters) - Investors stepped up pressure on corporate climate lobbying on Monday, launching a new 14-point action plan for companies to stick to or risk having their actions put to a shareholder vote.
The Global Standard on Responsible Climate Lobbying urges companies to commit to responsible climate lobbying, disclose the support given to trade groups lobbying on their behalf and take action if it runs counter to the world's climate goal.
That goal, to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms by mid-century, is moving increasingly out of reach, scientists say, with urgent action needed in the short-term to have any hope of reaching it.
Developed by Swedish pension scheme AP7, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management and the Church of England Pensions Board, the standard is backed by investor groups leading on climate talks with companies whose members manage a collective $130 trillion.
""Time must be called on negative climate lobbying. Investors will no longer tolerate a glaring gap between a company’s words and their actions on climate,"" said AP7, Sustainability Strategist Charlotta Dawidowski Sydstrand.
""As active owners we are committed to engaging collectively and individually with companies globally to highlight and improve their climate lobbying accountability and performance and to escalate this stewardship where required.""
In a statement, the investors said that lobbying that sought to delay, dilute or block climate action by governments ran counter to their interests and could result in resolutions being filed at the shareholder meetings of firms that failed to act.

""Corporate lobbying can significantly influence public climate policy,"" said Clare Richards, Senior Engagement Manager at the Church of England Pensions Board.
""We want the standard to set a high bar for companies, and to encourage a move away from ‘negative lobbying’ towards actively engaging in ‘responsible lobbying’ through supporting policies aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.""

(Reuters) - Lawyers for ZTE Corp (HK:0763) have been summoned to U.S. federal court in Texas on Monday for a hearing over whether the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker violated probation in connection with an alleged conspiracy to commit visa fraud.
ZTE is on probation in the United States after pleading guilty in Dallas in 2017 to illegally shipping U.S. technology to Iran and North Korea.
The alleged visa fraud stems from a 2021 case in Atlanta, Georgia. ZTE was not charged in that indictment. 
A former ZTE research director in New Jersey and a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology allegedly conspired to bring Chinese nationals to the United States to conduct research at ZTE between at least 2014 and 2018, according to the indictment.
The Chinese nationals came to the United States on J-1 visas, designed for work and study at institutions like Georgia Tech, but allegedly conducted research for ZTE in New Jersey. 
The professor, Gee-Kung Chang, has pleaded not guilty. The status of the former ZTE research director, Jianjun Yu, is unclear. 
Shares of ZTE Corp in both Hong Kong and Shenzhen fell more than 12% last week after news of the hearing.
In a March 4 notice to the Hong Kong stock exchange, ZTE said Yu left the company years ago, and that no current employee had been charged in the visa case. ZTE said production and operation activities were being carried out normally.

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Atlanta, where the visa case is pending, declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington. A lawyer for ZTE did not respond to a request for comment. 
ZTE paid $892 million and pleaded guilty in Texas in 2017 to criminal charges for violating U.S. laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) -South Africa's civil aviation regulator grounded Comair's planes indefinitely on Sunday over unresolved safety issues, in a move that also affects low-cost airline Kulula and British Airways, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.
A spokesperson for the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) said it had extended a 24-hour precautionary suspension of Comair's operator certificate indefinitely.
The suspension was meant to end on Sunday, but Comair has not adequately addressed all the necessary safety issues, the SACAA said.
""This morning we communicated to them (Comair) that their air operator certificate is now indefinitely suspended until they close all of the findings,"" SACAA spokesperson Phindiwe Gwebu told Reuters, effectively grounding the company's fleet of Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft.
Comair said it was unable to confirm when it would start flying again, after working through the night to provide documentation to SACAA following a review of certain policies, systems and procedures.
""This is a huge blow to our customers, employees and the flying public as it effectively takes 40% of the capacity out of the market,"" Glenn Orsmond, Comair chief executive said in a statement.
There would be considerable implications for the aviation sector and the country should the suspension be prolonged, he added.
CHARTERED FLIGHTS
Airports Company SA (ACSA), which runs the country's largest airports, said some of the stranded passengers were placed on chartered flights arranged by BA and Comair, specifically for commuters on the popular Johannesburg and Cape Town route.
""Priority is also given to those passengers who have onward international connecting flights,"" Terence Delomoney, ACSA's group executive operations manager said.
Issuing the precautionary notice on Saturday, the regulator said in the past month Comair had experienced safety problems ranging from ""engine failures, engine malfunction and landing gear malfunctions,"" among others.
In its investigations, SACAA said it had discovered three so-called ""level 1"" findings ""which pose an immediate risk"" and must be addressed immediately. 
Gwebu did not elaborate on what outstanding safety issues Comair, which flies local and regional routes from South Africa under the British Airways (BA) livery as part of a licence agreement, needed to address before flying again. Besides flying BA planes, Comair also operates the Kulula brand.

A notice on Kulula's website showed that Comair had been aiming to resume its schedule by 12 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Sunday, subject to SACAA's approval.
""We will do everything we can to accommodate customers affected by the suspension on other flights, prioritising vulnerable customers and those who most urgently needed to travel,"" Comair said, adding that customers would also be kept informed via text.

1123,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2022 09:00AM ET</span>",Investors jump into commodities while keeping eye on recession risk,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Investors are rushing to recalibrate their portfolios for a potentially extended period of elevated commodity prices, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparks eye-popping moves in raw materials that threaten to exacerbate inflation and hurt growth. 
Wild moves have been the norm in commodities over the last few weeks, as the war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russia helped lift oil prices to 14-year highs and natural gas prices near records. Prices for wheat and copper stand near all-time highs, while a doubling of the price of nickel earlier this week forced the London Metals Exchange to halt trading in the metal. [L2N2VE09Q][L2N2VE0JL]
With the U.S. economy already feeling the stress of a broad, post-COVID-19 boost in demand and a quick resolution to the West’s standoff with Russia in doubt, some investors are betting high commodity prices are likely to remain for the foreseeable future. 
Investors have sent $10.5 billion into commodities-focused ETFs and mutual funds since the start of the year, including a $2.8 billion gain in the week that ended March 2 that was the largest one-week positive inflow since July 2020, according to ICI data. 
""This is a very unique environment that we’re in because you have both demand shocks and supply shocks to the system at the same time,"" said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital. 
Marshall believes demand for commodities is likely to remain strong even if geopolitical tensions ebb, fueled by factors like electric car battery production, which requires metals such as copper and nickel. A $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill passed in November is increasing demand for steel, cement and other commodities, he said. 
He is increasing his stake in steel producer Cleveland Cliffs Inc and agricultural companies  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) Co, while cutting positions in consumer companies most likely to feel the brunt of higher gas and materials costs. 
Massive rallies in commodities have increased pressure on the Federal Reserve and other central banks to tighten monetary policy and fight inflation. This has ramped up worries that doing so will hurt economic growth as rising prices already weigh on consumers. 
Investors widely expect the Fed to announce the first rate increase since 2018 at the end of its monetary policy meeting next week and have priced in 1.75 percentage points in tightening this year. Data this week showed consumer prices grew at their fastest pace last month in 40 years. [L2N2VC2QK][FEDWATCH] 
Matthew Schwab, portfolio manager of the Harbor Capital All-Weather Inflation Focus ETF, has increased his exposure to oil and metals futures. Prices for industrial metals are likely to stay high due to underproduction during the coronavirus pandemic, while oil companies appear content to trade lower production for higher prices, he said. 
""You are able to see the signs of a commodity price rally in the lack of investment over the last decade,"" Schwab said. 
Mark Khalamayzer, lead manager of the Columbia Commodity Strategy Fund, has increased his exposure to oil and agricultural commodities to the highest limits allowed by his fund prospectus, betting that the conflict in Ukraine will lead to prices spiraling higher. 
Brent crude settled at $112.67 a barrel on Friday and is up 44% since the start of the year.
Even as investors try to align their portfolios to expectations of higher raw materials prices, they are worried about how the rally in commodities could hurt growth. 

The risk of a recession led by a sharp cutback in consumer spending rises the longer that oil prices stay high, said Robert Schein, chief investment officer, Blanke Schein Wealth Management. 
""If oil prices stay well above $100 per barrel for a few months, the consumer and economy can withstand this, but if $100-plus oil prices last for more than six months, that's when we will see recession risk surge,"" he said.

His car was involved in an accident with a senior police official's car, both vehicles were impounded and the case was under investigation, local news agency IANS reported.
Media reports said Sharma's Jaguar Land Rover allegedly rammed into a senior police official's car. It was not clear who was driving the car during the incident.
A senior Delhi police official involved in the probe said Sharma was interrogated by the police regarding a minor offence and allowed to leave the police station.
Asked about the incident, a Paytm spokesperson said a complaint had been filed in connection with an alleged minor motor vehicle incident. No person or property was harmed, the spokesperson said, adding that the media reports were ""exaggerated"" and that required procedures had been completed.

The spokesperson did not immediately clarify who was driving the vehicle.
Paytm, which counts China's Ant Group and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp among its backers, raised $2.5 billion in India's biggest initial public offering in November, but made a dismal debut on the stock exchanges and has lost over 50% since then.

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2022 07:15AM ET</span>",Alzheimer's patient groups pressure U.S. to pay for Biogen drug,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) - Patient groups are mounting a public pressure campaign aimed at persuading the U.S. government to loosen proposed restrictions on new Alzheimer's treatments, spending millions of dollars on television and local advertisements that began running during the Sunday morning political shows. 
The unusual ad campaign comes after a high-profile disagreement between government health agencies over who should have access to Biogen’s Aduhelm, the first treatment for the mind-wasting disease to be approved in 20 years.
The government’s Medicare program, which provides health benefits for Americans aged 65 and older, in January proposed paying for Biogen’s drug and similar treatments in development only for patients enrolled in years-long government studies.
The drugs being considered remove amyloid plaques from the brain of people with Alzheimer's. The agency has until April 11 to issue a final coverage decision.
The highly restrictive move came after Aduhelm was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last June, even though only one of two late-stage trials showed that it helped slow cognitive decline. As written, the Medicare plan would also apply to plaque-clearing drugs in advanced development by Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Co, Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF) and Eisai Co (OTC:ESALY) Ltd.
USAgainstAlzheimer's, one of the largest U.S.-based groups representing patients with the disease, said it is funding ads in the Washington D.C. and Baltimore areas targeting the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the White House and Congress.
    ""We want to put a face on the individuals that are affected by this Medicare decision,"" said USAgainstAlzheimer's Chairman George Vradenburg. ""We tend to talk about big numbers. We don't talk about individual people."" 
He said the group is spending millions on the campaign, which will feature Alzheimer's patients, including social media outreach and print ads on bus stops and other transportation in the Washington area. Many have the tag line ""Alzheimer's patients can't wait.""
Thousands of patients and doctors have already pressured the Medicare agency with letters, echoing the companies’ assertions that patients should not be cut off from the new drugs once they have been approved. At the same time, many comments praised Medicare for putting curbs on Aduhelm's use.
Aduhelm's price - cut in December to $28,200 from $56,000 per year - sparked concerns about Medicare's budget since Alzheimer's is an age-related disease and around 85% of people eligible for the drug are covered by the government plan.
    The number of Americans with Alzheimer's is expected to rise to 13 million by 2050 from more than 6 million currently.

Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) has estimated that around 1 million should be eligible for Aduhelm, which is approved for people in the early stages of the memory-robbing illness.
    The Alliance for Aging Research said it has organized a protest for Tuesday across the street from HHS headquarters in Washington, during which patients, their caregivers and others will call for Medicare to reconsider its restrictive plan.

By Richa Naidu
LONDON (Reuters) - At least six independent Nike stores in Russia were open on Friday afternoon, according to checks made by Reuters, more than a week after the world's biggest sports retailer said it was temporarily closing all its shops in the country.
Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike said the stores that were open are owned and operated by independent partners. 
Nike said on March 3 that it would temporarily suspend operations at all its Nike-owned and -operated stores in Russia, joining several Western brands that did so following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
Reuters could not immediately determine the total number of independent, partner stores that were open on Friday. Nike has roughly 100 stores in the Russian Federation, according to the store directory on its website, which showed that all of them were ""open."" A Nike spokesperson said Friday that Nike is ""updating"" its online store locator ""to reflect our store closures."" 

Days prior to Nike's announcement that stores would temporarily close, Nike made merchandise purchases on its website and app unavailable in Russia and directed its customers in the country to brick-and-mortar stores instead. 
Nike is providing continuity pay for employees in the stores it closed, the Nike spokesperson said Friday.

Russia's economy faces its deepest crisis since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, as the West imposes severe sanctions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Some western allies have encouraged India to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine, after New Delhi abstained from voting against Moscow, a long-standing arms supplier, at the United Nations.
""Russia's oil and petroleum product exports to India have approached $1 billion, and there are clear opportunities to increase this figure,"" said Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, according to a statement shared by Russia's embassy in India late on Friday.
""We are interested in further attracting Indian investment to the Russian oil and gas sector and expanding Russian companies' sales networks in India,"" Novak told Indian Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri.
The United States this week banned Russian oil imports and Britain said it will phase them out by year end, decisions expected to further disrupt the global energy market, where Russia is the second-largest exporter of crude.

Indian state-run companies hold stakes in Russian oil and gas fields, while Russian entities including Rosneft own a majority stake in Indian refiner Nayara Energy. Some Indian companies also buy Russian oil.
Russia expects both countries to continue cooperation on civilian nuclear power, including building new units at a nuclear power plant in the south Indian town of Kudankulam, Novak said.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 08:30PM ET</span>",Investors jump into commodities while keeping eye on recession risk,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are rushing to recalibrate their portfolios for a potentially extended period of elevated commodity prices, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparks eye-popping moves in raw materials that threaten to exacerbate inflation and hurt growth. 
Wild moves have been the norm in commodities over the last few weeks, as the war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on Russia helped lift oil prices to 14-year highs and natural gas prices near records. Prices for wheat and copper stand near all-time highs, while a doubling of the price of nickel earlier this week forced the London Metals Exchange to halt trading in the metal. [L2N2VE09Q][L2N2VE0JL]
With the U.S. economy already feeling the stress of a broad, post-COVID-19 boost in demand and a quick resolution to the West’s standoff with Russia in doubt, some investors are betting high commodity prices are likely to remain for the foreseeable future. 
Investors have sent $10.5 billion into commodities-focused ETFs and mutual funds since the start of the year, including a $2.8 billion gain in the week that ended March 2 that was the largest one-week positive inflow since July 2020, according to ICI data. 
""This is a very unique environment that we’re in because you have both demand shocks and supply shocks to the system at the same time,"" said Eric Marshall, a portfolio manager at Hodges Capital. 
Marshall believes demand for commodities is likely to remain strong even if geopolitical tensions ebb, fueled by factors like electric car battery production, which requires metals such as copper and nickel. A $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill passed in November is increasing demand for steel, cement and other commodities, he said. 
He is increasing his stake in steel producer Cleveland Cliffs Inc and agricultural companies  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) and Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) Co, while cutting positions in consumer companies most likely to feel the brunt of higher gas and materials costs. 
Massive rallies in commodities have increased pressure on the Federal Reserve and other central banks to tighten monetary policy and fight inflation. This has ramped up worries that doing so will hurt economic growth as rising prices already weigh on consumers. 
Investors widely expect the Fed to announce the first rate increase since 2018 at the end of its monetary policy meeting next week and have priced in 1.75 percentage points in tightening this year. Data this week showed consumer prices grew at their fastest pace last month in 40 years. [L2N2VC2QK][FEDWATCH] 
Matthew Schwab, portfolio manager of the Harbor Capital All-Weather Inflation Focus ETF, has increased his exposure to oil and metals futures. Prices for industrial metals are likely to stay high due to underproduction during the coronavirus pandemic, while oil companies appear content to trade lower production for higher prices, he said. 
""You are able to see the signs of a commodity price rally in the lack of investment over the last decade,"" Schwab said. 
Mark Khalamayzer, lead manager of the Columbia Commodity Strategy Fund, has increased his exposure to oil and agricultural commodities to the highest limits allowed by his fund prospectus, betting that the conflict in Ukraine will lead to prices spiraling higher. 
Brent crude settled at $112.67 a barrel on Friday and is up 44% since the start of the year.
Even as investors try to align their portfolios to expectations of higher raw materials prices, they are worried about how the rally in commodities could hurt growth. 

The risk of a recession led by a sharp cutback in consumer spending rises the longer that oil prices stay high, said Robert Schein, chief investment officer, Blanke Schein Wealth Management. 
""If oil prices stay well above $100 per barrel for a few months, the consumer and economy can withstand this, but if $100-plus oil prices last for more than six months, that's when we will see recession risk surge,"" he said.

A spokesman for the New York asset manager said via e-mail that the impact on clients would ""depend on their initial asset allocation and the timing of their allocations to or away from this market during the period"".

BlackRock last week said it had suspended the purchase of all Russian securities and given the figure that Russian securities accounted for less than 0.01% of its $10 trillion in assets. Most of BlackRock's remaining exposure is through index strategies. 

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Wednesday said moves by Western companies to break commercial and financial ties means ""Russia has been essentially cut off from global capital markets"".
""BlackRock will continue actively consulting with regulators, index providers and other market participants to help ensure our clients can exit their positions in Russian securities, whenever and wherever regulatory and market conditions allow,"" the spokesman said via e-mail on Friday.

(Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes stumbled on Friday as tech and growth shares led a broad decline and investors worried about the conflict in Ukraine while attention turned to the Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week. 
At the end of a volatile week, indexes had opened higher after Russian President Vladimir Putin said there were ""certain positive shifts"" in talks with Ukraine, without providing any details, but stocks then faded during the session.
All 11 S&P 500 sectors ended down, with communication services falling 1.9% and technology dropping 1.8%. 
“After we saw a bounce in the middle of the week, there is still too much uncertainty out there,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. ""The market has had a tough couple of Mondays so I think the short-term players want to take some chips off the table.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 229.88 points, or 0.69%, to 32,944.19, the S&P 500 lost 55.21 points, or 1.30%, to 4,204.31 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 286.15 points, or 2.18%, to 12,843.81.
The benchmark S&P 500 fell 2.9% for the week, and logged its second straight weekly decline. The Dow fell for a fifth straight week.
  On Friday, declines in shares of megacap growth companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc dragged on the S&P 500. Apple fell 2.4% while Tesla dropped 5.1%.
Meta Platforms shares fell 3.9% as Russia opened a criminal case against the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent after the social network changed its hate speech rules to allow users to call for ""death to the Russian invaders"" in the context of the war with Ukraine.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine had reached a ""strategic turning point"" in the conflict with Russia, but Russian forces bombarded cities across the country and appeared to be regrouping for a possible assault on the capital Kyiv.
Regarding developments in the Ukraine crisis, “you just don’t know what you are going to see so there’s no reason to go into the weekend with a risk-on attitude,” said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
Growth stocks also came under pressure as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hovered near 2%. 
Stocks have struggled this year as concerns about the Russia-Ukraine crisis have deepened a sell-off initially fueled by worries over higher bond yields as the Fed is expected to tighten monetary policy this year to fight inflation. The S&P 500 is down 11.8% in 2022.
The U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates at its March 15-16 meeting. 
A survey showed U.S. consumer sentiment fell more than expected in early March as gasoline prices surged to a record high in the aftermath of Russia's war against Ukraine.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.83-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.54-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 36 new highs and 274 new lows.
About 13 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the 13.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

LONDON (Reuters) -Facebook owner Meta Platforms said Friday that a temporary change in its content policy, only for Ukraine, was needed to let users voice opposition to Russia's attack, as Russia opened a criminal case after the company said it would allow posts such as ""death to the Russian invaders.""
Russian prosecutors asked a court to designate the U.S. tech giant as an ""extremist organisation,"" and the communications regulator said it would restrict access to Meta's Instagram starting March 14. The company said the decision would affect 80 million users in Russia.
""A criminal case has been initiated ... in connection with illegal calls for murder and violence against citizens of the Russian Federation by employees of the American company Meta, which owns the social networks Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said.
The committee reports directly to President Vladimir Putin. It was not immediately clear what the consequences of the criminal case might be.
Meta Global Affairs President Nick Clegg responded after the Russian government action with a tweeted statement saying that the company aimed to protect rights to speech as an expression of self-defense reacting to the invasion of Ukraine and that the policy only applied to Ukraine.
""If we applied our standard content policies without any adjustments we would now be removing content from ordinary Ukrainians expressing their resistance and fury at the invading military forces, which would rightly be viewed as unacceptable,"" Clegg wrote.
""We have no quarrel with the Russian people. There is no change at all in our policies on hate speech as far as the Russian people are concerned,"" he added.
Two weeks into Russia's war in Ukraine, a Meta spokesperson said on Thursday the company had temporarily altered its rules for political speech, allowing posts such as ""death to the Russian invaders,"" although it would not allow calls for violence against Russian civilians.
Meta said the temporary change aimed to allow for forms of political expression that would normally violate its rules.
Its oversight board said on Friday that it had been briefed by the company on Ukraine-related policies and that context was important for content policies and enforcement.
Internal Meta emails previously seen by Reuters said the temporary policy changes on calls for violence to Russian soldiers had applied to the markets of: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine. 
A Meta spokesperson declined to provide comment other than Clegg's statement.
The emails seen by Reuters also showed the U.S. company had temporarily allowed posts that call for the death of Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
""We hope it is not true because if it is true then it will mean that there will have to be the most decisive measures to end the activities of this company,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
INFORMATION WARS
Russia has for more than a year been striving to curb the influence of U.S. tech giants including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), repeatedly fining them for allowing what it deems to be illegal content.
But the invasion of Ukraine - met by a storm of international condemnation and unprecedented sanctions - has sharply raised the stakes in the information war.
Social media provide an opportunity for dissent against Putin's line - loyally followed by the tightly controlled state media - that Moscow was forced to launch its ""special military operation"" to defend Russian-speakers in Ukraine against genocide and to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country.
The Investigative Committee said the Facebook move could violate articles of the Russian criminal law against public calls for extremist activities.
""Such actions of the (Meta) company's management not only form an idea that terrorist activity is permissible, but are aimed at inciting hatred and enmity towards the citizens of the Russian Federation,"" the state prosecutor's office said.
It said it had applied to a court to recognise Meta as an extremist organisation and prohibit its activities in Russia.
Meta's other services also are popular in Russia. Facebook last year had an estimated 7.5 million users and WhatsApp 67 million, according to researcher Insider Intelligence. 
Last week, Russia said it was banning Facebook in the country in response to what it said were restrictions of access to Russian media on the platform.

Instagram is a favoured tool of jailed Putin opponent Alexei Navalny, who used it in a message posted via his lawyers and supporters on Friday to call for Russians to join protests against the Ukraine war and ""mad maniac Putin"" this weekend.
WhatsApp will not be affected by the legal moves, Russia's RIA news agency cited a source as saying, as the messaging app is considered a means of communication not a way to post information.

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell, weighed down by tech and growth stocks. Oil prices settled up for the day but down for the week in volatile trading.
Investors kept their focus on Ukraine, where Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv regrouped northwest of the capital. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his country had ""already reached a strategic turning point"" in the conflict.

U.S. consumer sentiment fell in early March by more than expected on inflation concerns, according to a Friday report, while data released Thursday showed consumer prices in February notched their largest annual increase in 40 years.
Next week, the Fed is expected to begin raising interest rates, and the Bank of England is expected to continue its rate-hikes, especially after January's economic growth numbers from the U.K. came in stronger than expected.

(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc on Friday urged the rejection of four shareholder proposals recommending that it replace Warren Buffett as chairman, report on its plans to handle climate risk and reduce greenhouse gases, and improve diversity.
The company, run by Buffett since 1965, also said the 91-year-old received $373,204 in compensation for 2021, down from $380,328 a year earlier, comprising his usual $100,000 salary plus personal and home security.
Though Buffett's salary is low for a chief executive officer of a major company, his 16.2% Berkshire stake comprises most of his $117.9 billion net worth, which Forbes magazine said makes him the world's fifth-richest person.
Berkshire disclosed Buffett's pay and recommendations on shareholder proposals in its annual proxy filing, ahead of the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's April 30 annual meeting.
It also said Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, who respectively oversee Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance operations, were in 2021 each awarded $19 million for a third straight year. Buffett sets their pay.
Berkshire has said Abel would become CEO and Buffett's son Howard Buffett would become non-executive chairman if Warren Buffett could not continue in those roles.
One shareholder proposal, from the National Legal and Policy Center, said those roles are ""greatly diminished"" because Buffett holds both, weakening governance, and an independent director should become chairman.
According to the filing, Berkshire's directors agree that is a good idea, but only after Buffett is no longer CEO.
In urging rejections of the environmental proposals, Berkshire said many operating units already make disclosures concerning climate risks, and its insurance operations appropriately manage risks from greenhouse gases.
It also said its operating businesses have committed to diversity, equity and inclusion without needing direction from Buffett.
Berkshire's dozens of business units include Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, Brooks running and See's candies, among others.

Buffett controls 32.1% of Berkshire's voting power. Shareholder proposals he opposes normally fail by big margins.

Customers will have to pay a surcharge fee of either 45 cents or 55 cents on each Uber trip and 35 cents or 45 cents on each Uber Eats order, depending on their location. The money charged will go directly to the workers, Uber said.
The surcharge will last for at least 60 days after which it will make adjustments based on feedback from workers and customers.

The move comes as many Uber drivers have been protesting on social media over high gas costs that have been eating into their earnings even as the company raised its profitability outlook, with some asking if it was still worth getting behind the wheel.
Western sanctions following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, a major oil producer, had crippled global oil trade and could further lift gasoline prices.

Agriculture firms have been slower than oil companies and retailers to announce they are curtailing Russian operations following Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which has been near universally condemned around the world.
""Food is a basic human right and should never be used as a weapon,"" Cargill, a U.S.-based privately held company, said in a statement.
Cargill this week removed details on its businesses in Russia and Ukraine from its website. The site previously said Cargill employs about 2,500 people in Russia, with investments of more than $1.1 billion in agro-processing. 
A Cargill spokesperson said the information was removed because the investment figure was not correct. The company declined to provide an updated figure on Russian investments. 
Rival ADM said in a statement its footprint in Russia was very limited and it would ""scale down operations in Russia not related to the production and transport of essential food commodities and ingredients."" 
ADM has an arm of its WILD flavorings business in Russia and a 50% stake in Aston Foods and Food Ingredients, a sweeteners and starches business.

Rival  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd said on Thursday it had suspended any new export business from Russia, but its oilseed crush plant is still operating there and serving the domestic market. Bunge has $121 million in total assets in the country, according to an SEC filing.
Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC), the fourth in the quartet of the so-called ABCD companies that dominate global grain trading, said it suspended Russian operations on March 4.

The stock fell 2.4%, ending at its lowest since November in a broad selloff of technology shares. It dropped 5.2% for the week, the fifth straight week of losses, declining more than 10% over that period. The Nasdaq 100 Index slid 2.1% and posted a weekly loss of 3.9%.
Tech stocks have come under pressure this year on concern growth will slow as the Federal Reserve starts raising interest rates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which caused commodity prices to jump and heightened worries about inflation, has also weighed on the group.
Apple remains a relative outperformer so far this year. Its loss of nearly 13% is less than the Nasdaq 100’s 18% drop. Investors have gravitated toward it as something of a haven, although that hasn’t been enough to offset the macroeconomic factors that are expected to continue weighing on the sector.
“Investors see macro indicators pointing to a slowdown, and Apple is getting swept up in that broad selling,” said Jordan Kahn, chief investment officer of ACM Funds. “I don’t think tech is in a position where it will immediately bounce back, but even if Apple is unlikely to see a lot of multiple expansion from here, it shouldn’t see much compression either, given the stability of its earnings and the growth in its services business.”
Apple is trading at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 6.2, compared with its five-year average of 4.6. The forward P/E is 24.5, above the long-term average of 20.3.
Kahn, whose fund owns the stock, described this valuation as “more neutral than compelling, which does make it something of a safety play, as there are parts of tech that saw bubble-like multiples and should continue to see compression.”

Investing.com – The S&P 500 fell for the second-straight week Friday as selling intensified into the close on signs elevated inflation is hurting the consumer as the Russia-Ukraine war is set roll into its third week ahead of the Federal Reserve rate hike.    
The S&P 500 fell 1.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%, or 230 points, the Nasdaq fell 2.2%.
Consumer discretionary stocks led the broader market lower as investors digested data pointing to a wobble in consumer sentiment in the wake of surging inflation that ratcheted up a notch following the Russia-Ukraine war.  
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA),  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS), and  Etsy Inc  (NASDAQ:ETSY) led the losses in consumer discretionary stocks, with the latter falling by more than 11%.
The March University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index, which is negatively correlated with inflation, fell to 59.7 from 62.8, the lowest level since September 2011.
“This latest leg down [in the survey] surely reflects the recent spike in gasoline prices since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war,” Jefferies said in a note.
Signs of weakness in consumer, which is a key driver of economic growth, overshadowed hopes for a Ukraine-Russia agreement on a ceasefire after Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly signaled positive developments in peace talks with Ukraine.
President Joe Biden continued to up the ante on Moscow, calling on lawmakers to revoke Russia’s “most favored nation” status, which could end normal trade with Russia, leading to higher tariffs.
Technology gains a day earlier proved short-lived as the sector resumed its selloff. Big tech as mostly in the red, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) the biggest decliners.
Meta was also pressured by concerns that user growth could slow even further after Russia restricted access to the social media giant’s Instagram platform and launched a criminal probe in the company.
The investigation was opened after the social media giant changed its policy on hate speech to allow statements such as “death to Russian invaders” on its platforms.
The weakness in the broader market comes just a week ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting, which gets underway on March 15.
Ahead of the meeting, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has backed a quarter point rate hike and said that the Fed would likely begin talks about how to reduce its balance sheet.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Deutsche Bank, which faced stinging criticism from some investors and politicians for its ongoing ties to Russia, said on Friday in a surprise move that it would wind down its business in the country.
Deutsche joins the ranks of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), which were the first major U.S. banks to exit after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Those moves put pressure on rivals to follow..
Deutsche had resisted pressure to sever ties, arguing that it needed to support multinational firms doing business in Russia. 
But on Friday evening in Frankfurt, the bank suddenly reversed course.
""We are in the process of winding down our remaining business in Russia while we help our non-Russian multinational clients in reducing their operations,"" the bank said.
""There won't be any new business in Russia,"" Deutsche said. 
A day earlier,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s Chief Executive Christian Sewing explained to staff why the bank was not withdrawing.
""The answer is that this would go against our values,"" he wrote. ""We have clients who cannot exit Russia overnight.""
Bill Browder, an investor who has spent years campaigning to expose corruption in Russia, said that Deutsche Bank staying was ""completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the West.""
""I would be surprised if they are able to maintain this position as the situation in Ukraine continues to deteriorate,"" Browder told Reuters earlier on Friday.
The criticism came as Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv were regrouping northwest of the Ukrainian capital and Britain said that Moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days.
Fabio De Masi, a former member of the Bundestag and a prominent campaigner against financial crime, said that Deutsche Bank had close ties to the Russian elite, many of whom faced sanctions and that the relationship, where it involved criminal Russian activity, had to end.
'MONITORING'
Deutsche Bank has said that it has pared down its Russian footprint in recent years. This week it disclosed 2.9 billion euros in credit risk to the country, and said exposure is ""very limited"". 
It also operates a technology centre with about 1,500 employees in Russia and opened a new main office in Moscow in December, which it said at the time represented ""a significant investment and commitment to the Russian market"".
Russia has landed Deutsche Bank in hot water in the past.
The U.S. Department of Justice has been investigating it for years over trades that authorities said were used to launder $10 billion out of Russia, which has led to the German bank being fined nearly $700 million. 
Deutsche Bank said on Friday that the DOJ probe ""is understood to be ongoing"".
The row over Russia came as Deutsche Bank disclosed in its annual report that it paid Sewing 8.8 million euros ($9.68 million) in 2021, a 20% increase from a year earlier. 

Overall, the lender paid 14% more, or 2.1 billion euros, in bonuses for 2021, rewarding staff for the bank's most profitable year in a decade.

""We continue to support our employees in the region. We are also engaging with our customers outside Russia who depend on us for data and pricing information inside Russia. We are evaluating alternative options to continue providing these services.""
The company joins an exodus of Western firms severing ties with Russia after it was slapped with heavy sanctions in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) had already suspended access in Russia to products containing news and commentary since Wednesday this week, and had suspended all new sales of products and services.
However, at the time it did not suspend access to data products for existing customers in Russia. 
LSEG distributes news and commentary from Reuters as part of its products.  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), the parent of Reuters News, holds a minority stake in the LSE after the exchange bought data and analytics company Refinitiv from it.
A new Russian law makes it possible to jail journalists who report any event that could discredit the Russian military.
Ukraine's central bank the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) wrote to data platform Refinitiv and rival Bloomberg last week to urge them to ban Russian and Belarussian financial institutions from accessing their platforms.

The NBU argued such a move would ""cripple their access to the international financial markets"".

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Volkswagen AG, Europe's top carmaker, doubled its operating profit in 2021 but warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its impact on supply chains could hit business this year in unforeseen ways.
Carmakers are scrambling to find alternative sources of vital parts made in Ukraine, including wire harnesses, from as far afield as China and Mexico, as Russia's invasion halts assembly lines and breaks complex supply chains.
""The conflict ... has an impact on the entire global economy, on raw materials, on supply chains and therefore on our company,"" Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) finance chief Arno Antlitz told journalists on Friday after publishing preliminary 2021 results.
""The impact of this cannot be conclusively assessed at this point in time,"" he said, adding the group was currently working on tapping other suppliers in Eastern Europe and North Africa to obtain wire harnesses.
Volkswagen said there was a risk that the latest developments in the war in Ukraine will have a negative impact on its business. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
The company still proposed to raise its annual dividend by more than half to 7.50 euros per ordinary share and 7.56 euros per preferred share for 2021, after operating profit doubled to 19.3 billion euros ($21.1 billion) last year.
The doubling of operating profit in 2021 was thanks to higher prices and a more favorable product mix, Volkswagen said, adding it expects an operating margin on sales of 7.0%-8.5% in 2022, compared with 7.7% in 2021.
Sales are forecast to rise 8%-13% in 2022, compared with a 12.3% increase to 250 billion euros in 2021.

""However, this guidance is subject to the further development of the war in Ukraine and in particular the impact on the group's supply chains and the global economy as a whole,"" the company said.

The agreement to extend the monitoring of the bank comes as the Justice Department ratchets up scrutiny of corporate misconduct and repeat offenders. 
In October, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco laid out policies that included heightened scrutiny of repeat corporate offenders. The agency has been questioning how broadly to continue deferring prosecutions in exchange for penalties and promises of compliance. 
The issue at Deutsche Bank revolves around claims by the former head of sustainability at DWS saying the investment firm overstated how it used sustainable investing criteria to manage investments. DWS has rejected the allegations of so-called greenwashing.
The DOJ, which had already installed a monitor at Deutsche for other issues, found that the bank violated a deferred prosecution agreement, Deutsche Bank said.
The violation was based on ""untimely reporting"" of the allegations, Deutsche said.
As a result, on Feb. 28, Deutsche agreed to extend the monitor until February 2023.
Deutsche Bank, DWS and the DOJ declined to comment.
Last year, the agency agreed with Deutsche Bank it would hold off prosecuting the bank over alleged corruption and fraud in exchange for a stiff penalty and promises to disclose any future misconduct and cooperate with any ongoing investigation.

Though agreement breaches have been historically rare, the Justice Department has issued such notices in recent months as it seeks to root out corporate misconduct. 
Sweden's Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) has also recently disclosed getting a DOJ notice of a breach, underscoring the growing legal risks for corporate actors accused of repeat offenses.

(Reuters) -Camel and Lucky Strike cigarette maker  British American Tobacco  (NYSE:BTI) Plc said on Friday it would exit Russia and cut its fiscal 2022 guidance as a result, the latest company to leave the country due to worries about the safety of its employees.
Western companies have pulled out of Russia en masse as the United States, the European Union and Britain imposed sanctions aimed at curbing Moscow's access to funding.
In response, a government commission approved this week the first step towards nationalising assets of foreign firms that leave the country.
To exit the business or stop selling or manufacturing would be regarded as a criminal bankruptcy by Russia, and they may enforce criminal actions on local management, BAT (LON:BATS) Chief Executive Officer Kingsley Wheaton told Reuters in an interview. 
""There's no way, consciously, we can expose our people to criminal repercussions.""
The company employs about 2,500 people in Russia, and Wheaton said it would continue to pay their salaries until it transfers its business in the country to another entity.
He said potential parties that could be interested include its Russian distributor of 30 years, which he declined to name. 
In 2021, Ukraine and Russia accounted for 3% of revenue, and a slightly lower proportion of adjusted profit from operations.
The company represents just under a quarter of Russia's tobacco market.
The exit prompted the cigarette maker to cut its annual revenue growth outlook to 2%-4% from 3%-5% announced last month.
It now also expects mid-single figure growth for adjusted earnings per share in 2022 on a constant currency basis, down from its previous high-single figure forecast.
Shares of the company ended the day down more than 1% on the news.
The decision to exit Russia comes two days after the company said it had suspended all its planned capital investment in the country.

Stating that ""the context is highly complex, exceptionally fast-moving and volatile"" after reviewing its presence in Russia, BAT said it had started the process to rapidly transfer the Russian business ""in full compliance with international and local laws"".

1157,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 01:07PM ET</span>","Exclusive-BP, Eni clinch deal on Angola joint venture","By Ron Bousso and Stephen Jewkes
LONDON (Reuters) - Eni and BP (NYSE:BP) have completed a deal to merge their oil and gas operations in Angola, the groups said on Friday, confirming what sources earlier exclusively told Reuters.
The deal will create a company called Azule Energy that is expected to be Angola’s largest producer with stakes in 16 licences and in the Angola LNG joint venture. 
Azule Energy will also take over Eni’s stake in Solenova, a solar company jointly held with Angola's Sonangol.
Earlier three sources said the two energy groups were close to raising around $2.5 billion in financing to help fund the joint venture and were also close to a separate agreement for Eni to buy stakes in Algerian gas plants. The two companies last year announced plans to combine their Angolan businesses into a self-funded company with oil and gas production of around 200,000 barrels of oil equivalentper day. The merger is part of the two companies' overhaul of their oil and gas businesses as they shift towards renewables and low-carbon energy in the coming decades. It will also help them to reduce debt. 
ALGERIAN GAS Under a separate deal, BP is close to selling to Eni its stakes in two major gas ‎developments in Algeria - In Salah Gas and In Amenas, the sources said. The value of such a deal is unclear.
One of the sources said the companies were in advanced talks. BP and Eni declined to comment on Algeria. The two sides have struggled to agree on a way to balance the value of their Angolan assets since Eni's operations and oil and gas reserves are bigger and hold a larger value than BP's, two of the sources said.

The statements issued by both companies on Friday said BP's gross assets in the deal were worth about $6.8 billion at the end of 2021, while those of Eni were worth $7.3 billion. The change of ownership at the two gas plants in the south of Algeria will help Eni develop Algeria's energy infrastructure and export gas to southern Europe via pipelines, the sources said. Italy is looking to ramp up gas imports from Algeria to help reduce its reliance on flows from Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. To do that Algeria needs to increase its upstream gas production. Eni, which holds long-term gas contracts with state-owned energy giant Sonatrach, has historic ties with Algeria. Last year it signed a series of accords aimed at increasing production in the country.
With one of Europe's biggest gas transport networks, Italy is seen as a future bridgehead into Europe for gas - and zero emissions hydrogen - produced in North Africa and beyond.

(Reuters) -European shares marked their biggest weekly gain this year, as signals from Russian President Vladimir Putin about a positive shift in talks with Ukraine helped markets end a volatile week on a firmer footing on Friday.
The pan-European STOXX 600 index closed 1% higher, and snapped three weeks of losses, adding 4% on the week as stellar gains for beaten down stocks outweighed declines from worries over the fallout from the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. 
Putin said on Friday there had been some progress and ""positive shifts"" in Moscow's talks with Ukraine, without elaborating, immediately lifting investor sentiment.
""Investors might find that trying to build a rally on comments from Vladimir Putin is a bit of a fool's errand, but that has been the theme of the day,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.
The German DAX surged 1.4%, logging its best week in a year, while Spain's IBEX and France's CAC 40 were up 0.9% each.

""European markets, like the DAX, already were pricing quite a big profit hit,"" said Dhaval Joshi, chief strategist at BCA Research.
""So any sort of positive news gives a sharp reversal because there's already quite a lot of bad news priced in,"" he said, but warned that markets are not fully pricing in second round effects such as the cutting off of important exports from Ukraine like agricultural exports.
The European Central Bank on Thursday paved the way for an interest rate hike as soaring inflation outweighed concerns about the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Euro zone banks recovered 4.5% this week, posting their best week in two months, after dropping nearly 19% last week due to their large exposure to Russia.

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 12:25PM ET</span>",Rental car giants embark on electric after pandemic bonanza,"(This March 9 story Corrects attribution of data for graphics and U.S. monthly revenue to Auto Rental News, instead of the American Car Rental Association)
By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - The $100 billion Western rental car industry, flush with cash from a profitable pandemic, is gradually getting its electric show on the road, and Chinese-made vehicles are poised to play a starring role. 
The electric transition could see car fleets, long dominated by famed marques from the United States and Europe, increasingly switch towards Asian automakers, according to a European executive. 
""Historically, European and American manufacturers had an edge, but the shift towards electric is reshuffling the cards,"" said Olivier Baldassari, group chief countries and operations officer at rental giant Europcar.
He said electric cars from Chinese and Asian makers were comparable to Western models in terms of quality, citing Great Wall Motor's Ora line, but generally cost less.
Even small savings are significant in the vast rental industry, which buys millions of new cars a year - a tenth of all new cars in the United States alone - and provides a leading indicator of wider auto trends in society.
Companies in the sector have long resisted a rush to electrify because of weak demand for electric vehicles (EVs) among customers worried about being stranded out of power. 
Yet several analysts said now is the best time to start as companies have fortified their coffers with bumper profits during a pandemic that emptied public transit and airports, and led to more holidaying within driving distance.
In the United States, rental car companies received record monthly revenue of $1,320 per vehicle in 2021, according to Auto Rental News. That compares to around $1,000 pre-pandemic.
""In the past, companies have kind of stuck their head in the sand,"" said Nick Mountfield, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants, which advises rental car companies, said about electrification. ""We're now starting to see people say that they'll have to do something about and put in place plans.""

WATCH YOUR SPEED
Hertz was an early mover last October when it announced the planned purchase of 100,000 vehicles from U.S. trailblazer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), upping the pressure on rivals to spell out transition plans.
French-based Europcar, meanwhile, pledged to make 20% of its fleet electric or low-emission hybrid by 2024, from 3% now, which means it will need to buy up to 70,000 cleaner vehicles in the coming two years if it restocks its fleet to the 350,000 vehicles it owned pre-pandemic. 
Rental companies sold off their fleets as demand plummeted at the start of the pandemic and have struggled to regain volumes amid a global shortage of semiconductors that has hampered vehicle production. 
Baldassari said Europcar was increasingly sourcing EVs from Great Wall Motors, SAIC Motor and Polestar, which is owned by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, though it was also buying from traditional partners, including  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Stellantis. 
The company's China strategy might shift, however, if German carmaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) manages to close its offer to buy the company in the second quarter.
Industry players are running at different speeds, with each making their own calculations based on their markets. 
In the United States, where many customers prefer SUV and pickup models that have yet to be electrified and public charging infrastructure lags much of Asia and Europe, Enterprise Holdings is striking a more cautious tone.
Electrifying just a quarter of Enterprise's fleet at Orlando airport - its largest consumer rental location - would require the same amount of daily electricity as is needed to power more than 1,000 homes, said Enterprise's assistant vice president of innovation, Chris Haffenreffer.
Haffenreffer said the group currently had several thousand EVs in North America, including from Tesla, Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Hyundai, Kia and Polestar. While the company said it has conversations with all global automakers, it has no immediate plans to boost that share. 
""At a high level, we want to let our consumers guide us in terms of what they're looking for,"" he added. ""Many car rental companies have historically taken that wait-and-see approach because we are still in the early phases of the transition."" 
Graphic on U.S. industry vehicle purchases: https://tmsnrt.rs/3gXAVnj
FOOTHOLD IN THE WEST
The varied pace of change, and the timeline for vast fleet overhauls means gasoline-powered vehicles are expected to remain the bulk of purchases for some years to come. Global automakers' transition plans as a whole would see electric vehicles make up at least 40% of their sales by 2040. 
Yet eventually the shift could prove far-reaching for the fortunes of Chinese in carmakers in Europe, a crowded, competitive auto market dominated by storied brands that has proved elusive for them to crack in the past. 
In years gone by, they have contended with a perception that China, associated with cheap mass-production, could not compete on quality. Yet such arguments are challenged in a new reality that sees top Western carmakers like BMW and Tesla now produce cars in the country, which is a technology powerhouse and the world's biggest auto market. 

Great Wall Motor, one of Europcar's suppliers, is expected to launch its Ora Cat compact electric car in Europe this year priced at around 20,000 euros ($22,260) with a range of around 250 miles (400 km), joining a growing number of Chinese EV makers trying their luck on the continent.
Chinese manufacturers using the rental channel to establish brand awareness and increase sales volumes would follow a playbook Kia and Hyundai used in the 1990s to gain a foothold in Western markets, said Mountfield at OC&C Strategy.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) -European Union and British antitrust authorities launched parallel investigations on Friday into a 2018 online display advertising deal between Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), adding to a long list of regulatory challenges facing the U.S. tech giants.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) unit Google and Facebook, whose parent company is now called Meta, defended the ""Jedi Blue"" deal, which the EU said may thwart ad tech rivals and disadvantage publishers in online display advertising.
So-called header bidding allows publishers, such as news providers, to offer ad space to multiple ad exchanges and networks simultaneously, potentially generating more ad revenue.
The Jedi Blue agreement enables Meta via its Meta Audience Network, to participate in Google's Open Bidding programme, which is a rival to header bidding.
""A competing technology to Google's Open Bidding may have been targeted with the aim to weaken it and exclude it from the market for displaying ads on publisher websites and apps,"" EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
While one angle of the EU investigation focuses on the deal, another looks at whether Google abuses its dominance which could mean that Facebook is off the hook if this is found to be the case.
""This is a publicly documented, pro-competitive agreement that enables Facebook Audience Network (FAN) to participate in our Open Bidding program, along with dozens of other companies,"" Google said in response to the investigations.
""Meta's non-exclusive bidding agreement with Google and the similar agreements we have with other bidding platforms, have helped to increase competition for ad placements,"" Meta said in a statement.
Google, which has already been hit by more than 8 billion euros ($8.8 billion) in EU antitrust fines in the past decade, and Facebook are both being investigated by the bloc's executive over other issues and could face fines as much as 10% of their global turnover for breaching its rules.
Britain's antitrust authority is also investigating the deal and the EU competition watchdog said it intends to cooperate closely with its British counterpart.

Texas and 15 other U.S. states alleged in an antitrust complaint against Google that the deal with Facebook was struck as part of its effort to counter header bidding, which publishers wanted to use to make more money from advertising on their websites.

1165,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 11:27AM ET</span>","As EV demand rises, Biden officials warm to new mines","By Ernest Scheyder
HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are warming to approving new domestic sources of electric vehicle battery metals, as Washington bids to avoid a reliance on strategic minerals imports similar to that on crude oil.
U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm and other officials speaking at this week's CERAWeek energy conference in Houston said the need to domestically produce more metals is rising as EVs go mainstream, but that new mines must not harm the environment. 
Granholm told conference attendees she would work to streamline permitting for new sources of EV minerals, eliciting loud applause. 
""It takes forever to get a new permit. How crazy is that?"" said Granholm.
Granholm's department has already received applications for $2 billion in loans to fund U.S. strategic minerals projects from Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) Corp, ioneer, Piedmont Lithium Inc and others. 
The department is also proactively contacting junior miners to discuss potential loans.
""The goal here is to make sure that people know that it's not a lack of capital that's holding back the development of these assets in the United States,"" said Jigar Shah, head of the Energy Department's Loan Programs Office. ""
While the loan office is reviewing loan applications from some lithium projects that have faced opposition, funds will not be distributed to proposed mines that have not passed full regulatory review.
""We know that there will be some domestic mining,"" U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Michael Regan said on the sidelines of the conference. ""But it can't take place in the ways that it has in the past, which skirted some of the environmental laws and disproportionately impact communities of color and tribal communities.""

To be sure, President Joe Biden's administration is not moving carte blanche to approve all mines. Last month, for instance, it effectively killed  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO) Plc's Twin Metals copper project in Minnesota due to concerns the mine would harm an important watershed.
But mining executives said comments from Regan, Granholm and others show the White House is beginning to view mining with a more-nuanced lens and understand its role in a clean energy transition.

Shareholders approved various measures, such as charter amendments and a share issuance proposal, related to the transaction. They also supported golden parachute payments to executives, in case the transaction fails to close. 
The outcome was all but assured, as two of Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA)'s major investors, John C. Malone and Advance/Newhouse, agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger. They together represent 43% of Discovery's voting shares.
In May, AT&T (NYSE:T) announced it would spin-off WarnerMedia, whose assets include HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros studio, and merge it with Discovery. The combination would create one of the world's largest media companies with a breadth of well-known film franchises and television series, including Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings, ""Succession"" and the reality-series ""90 Day Fiance"" and ""Property Brothers."" 

The transaction has cleared regulatory reviews by the U.S. Department of Justice and the European Commission. Earlier this week, AT&T and Discovery secured funding for the deal through a $30 billion bond offering. 
The merger is expected to close as soon as April, with Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav leading the new Warner Brothers Discovery.

""Now that the close of the WarnerMedia deal is approaching, we are near the starting line of a new era for AT&T,"" CEO John Stankey said in a statement ahead of a presentation to analysts.
AT&T is merging its media business with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) in a $43 billion deal. The new combined entity is projected to have approximately $52 billion in revenue by 2023 and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of around $14 billion.
AT&T said it will focus on building out its 5G and fiber network. It said the $48 billion capex will be split equally over two years and will taper to the $20 billion range starting 2024.
The company wants to raise fiber internet availability to 30 million homes in the U.S. and expand its 5G network to cover over 200 million people.
By 2025, AT&T expects that 75% of its network will be served by fiber and 5G and that it will have reduced its copper services footprint by 50%.

After facing skepticism from shareholders over its expensive quest to become a media and entertainment company, AT&T (NYSE:T) is working to merge its WarnerMedia unit with Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Inc in a deal that is expected to close in the second quarter. The company plans to refocus on its core business of offering internet and phone services.

Shares of AT&T rose over 3% to $24.09 in pre-market trading.
AT&T said it expects annual capital investment to be in the $24 billion range both this year and in 2023. It will then taper to the $20 billion range beginning in 2024. 
The company is working to double its fiber internet availability to 30 million homes in the United States and expand its 5G network to cover over 200 million people.
AT&T on Friday also provided full-year financial guidance that excludes the WarnerMedia business and advertising unit Xandr, which AT&T agreed to sell to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in December.
The company said it expects low single-digit percentage growth for total revenue in 2022, unchanged from its previous outlook.
It also provided an outlook for 2023 for the first time, with continued low single-digit percentage revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share between $2.50 to $2.60. 

After closing the WarnerMedia and Discovery deal, the company expects to pay just over $8 billion in annual total dividends, AT&T said. 
Free cash flow for the standalone AT&T is expected to be in the $16 billion range this year and in the $20 billion range in 2023.

Investing.com --  Deutsche Bank  initiated coverage on Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX) Friday, assigning a buy rating and a $60 price target, implying an approximately 45% upside to the stock's closing price on Thursday.
Roblox shares are down 3.8% Friday, with its year-to-date decline now just under 61%. 
Analyst Benjamin Black told investors in a note that they see Roblox as an ""early leader in the interactive digital creator marketplace, with growing moats and strong network effects.""
Black pointed to the number of daily active users (DAUs) Roblox now has, which is approximately 50 million, with the analyst saying it represents a 56% compound annual growth rate over the last three years.
The analyst believes that growth will slow in 2022 compared to the growth during the pandemic, but they see multiple paths to 96 million DAUs by 2025.
""Similar to other large marketplaces like Amazon, Uber, or YouTube, Roblox's large supply base (developers), in our opinion, is one of its key competitive advantages,"" added the analyst.
""Over the last 3 years, Roblox has more than doubled its developer community, with almost 10mn on the platform today.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz has 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in assets that could be threatened by Russian proposals to nationalise the property of foreign firms that leave because of its invasion of Ukraine, the German premium carmaker said.
The company said in its annual report released on Friday that the war in Ukraine raised a range of risks from disruptions to parts to energy supply or even cyber attacks.
""These risks could be exacerbated by the potential expropriation of assets of Russian subsidiaries,"" Mercedes-Benz said.
Russia's ruling party, United Russia, said this week a government commission had approved the first step towards nationalising the assets of firms more than 25% owned by foreigners from ""unfriendly states.""
Mercedes-Benz has a car plant in the town of Esipovo 40 km (25 miles) northwest of Moscow with over 1,000 employees that produces E-class sedans and SUVs.
It was opened in April 2019 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in attendance. It was the first plant in years to be opened by a foreign carmaker in Russia, where investment into the formerly burgeoning auto industry had dried up amid western sanctions and a stagnant economy.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Putin said the plant would produce 25,000 cars a year and that investment in the project had totaled just under $300 million.

Mercedes-Benz said its Russian units, which were valued at 2 billion euros as of the end of 2021, have liabilities to banks of approximately 1 billion euros, for which the carmaker has issued a global guarantee.

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS aims to cut its financing of fossil fuel emissions by more than two-thirds by 2030, Switzerland's biggest bank said on Friday, joining lenders setting targets for the first time this year.
More than 100 banks have pledged to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and are under pressure to provide details on the deep shorter-term cuts needed if they are to have any chance of meeting their goal.
UBS unveiled plans on Friday to cut its loan book financing of emissions caused by the oil and gas sector by 71% through 2030 from a baseline of 3.781 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2020. That amounted to a steeper cut than those announced by competitors, but off a comparatively smaller lending book.
The bank said its target was for a reduction in absolute emissions, as opposed to the more flexible 'carbon intensity' metrics used by some rivals, which links emissions to the quantity of oil or gas produced.
Swiss rival  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said on Thursday it planned to cut its exposure to ""financed emissions"" in the oil, gas and coal sector by 49% through 2030 from a baseline of 37.1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2020.
UBS' plan does not include coal, which it said was a marginal area for the bank.
HSBC in February outlined aims to cut emissions associated with loans to oil and gas clients by 34% this decade, while  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) in January vowed to reduce its energy-sector emissions by 29% over the same period.
Other lenders, including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Natwest and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), have also set goals.

UBS' lending volume to fossil fuels dipped to $0.7 billion in 2021, it said on Friday. Its overall lending exposure to carbon-related assets was $45.6 billion, or 9.9% of its total customer lending.
UBS also aims to reduce the emissions intensity of its lending to power generation firms and to residential and commercial real estate lending. Together with fossil fuels, these accounted for a sizeable share of the emissions it financed, UBS said, making these priority sectors.

Brent crude oil jumped this week to a 14-year high as U.S. President Joe Biden's announcement of a ban on Russian oil and energy imports on Tuesday raised further concerns over surging crude prices.
However, crude prices eased later in the week, after the United Arab Emirates pledged to boost oil supply and it became clear the European Union would not join the United States and Britain in banning Russian oil. [O/R]
European bond funds suffered net selling of $8.2 billion, while U.S. funds and Asian bond funds witnessed outflows of $7.85 billion and $0.35 billion respectively.
Global high yield and, short- and medium-term bond funds posted outflows of $5.07 billion and $4.44 billion respectively.
However, government bond funds obtained $1.29 billion, while inflation-linked funds received $1.94 billion in inflows, a two-fold jump in purchases over the previous week.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 10:47AM ET</span>",Telecom Italia to give KKR bid verdict in Sunday board showdown,"By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT)'s board meets on Sunday to give its long-delayed response to a 10.8 billion euro ($12 billion) takeover approach from U.S. fund KKR amid mounting pressure to enter talks after an in-house turnaround plan failed to convince investors.
KKR made the non-binding offer last November to take the former phone monopoly private at a price of 0.505 euro per share. Telecom Italia (TIM) shares are now trading at 0.30 euro, after touching a record low of 0.22 euro on Monday.
The choice facing TIM appears simple enough - agree to talks with the U.S. private equity fund or reject its approach.
However, a compromise is also possible whereby TIM, whose leading shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) sees the approach as undervalued, seeks to enter talks on deepening existing cooperation with KKR while remaining independent.
KKR has been left on hold for more than three months as debt-laden TIM, in which state lender CDP is also a major investor, has been caught in its latest boardroom crisis.
New chief Pietro Labriola, a veteran TIM executive, last week revealed his own standalone plan aimed at unlocking value by separating TIM's wholesale operations from its service arm to pursue with M&A deals.
Backed by Vivendi, Labriola said KKR's intentions for TIM were broadly similar but he was convinced doing it internally could generate more value for investors.
COMPROMISE POSSIBLE?
Labriola's strategy received unanimous support from the board of directors but some independent members representing institutional investors are wary of dismissing KKR out of hand.
Some minority investors are also pressing the company to engage with KKR. The fund is seeking the backing of the company and the government, as well as a four-week due diligence process before it formalises a bid.
KKR is already involved with TIM, having paid 1.8 billion euros last year for a 37.5% stake in its secondary network. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and LionTree, advisers for the TIM board of directors, are due to complete a review of KKR's proposal weighed against TIM's in-house overhaul by the weekend.

Labriola's plan would facilitate a long-mooted merger of TIM's fixed assets network with those of fibre optic rival Open Fiber, a move advocated by CDP which owns a 10% stake in TIM and controls Open Fiber.
Under such a scenario, TIM's investors could see an upside of 1 euro a share versus the current set up, two sources familiar with the matter said.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish oil operator Meroil has no plans to sell its 50% stake in a joint venture with Russia's Lukoil in a Barcelona oil terminal due to the conflict in Ukraine, a top executive told Reuters on Friday.
Meroil is confident its 10-year-old project will not be affected by any potential new sanctions against Moscow and is not concerned about any reputational damage, Director General Miguel Paya said, arguing that the tie-up with Lukoil was very limited and the terminal did not receive Russian oil or ships.
Many Western companies have broken business ties with Russian firms or shunned their products or wound up Russian operations following the country's invasion of Ukraine. 
Shell (LON:RDSa), the world's largest petroleum trader, and Italy's Eni are among energy groups which have suspended the purchase of oil from Russia, while British oil major BP (NYSE:BP) exited its 19.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft.
Lukoil, Russia's second-largest oil producer, said earlier this month it was concerned by the ""tragic events in Ukraine"" and supported the negotiations to end the conflict.
The Meroil-Lukoil deal was sealed in 2010 and the Barcelona terminal - with a storage capacity of 360,000 cubic meters of refined oil and with a concession until 2047 - opened in 2012. 
""Everything remains the same ... they are calm. They continue working and so do we,"" Paya said referring to Litasco, Lukoil's Swiss trading arm that holds a 50% stake in the Barcelona plant.
He said his understanding is that any potential sanctions against Lukoil would not affect their JV, but conceded the situation was unpredictable. 
""There is not much we can do about it,"" he said, adding Meroil had no say over Lukoil's stake.

The joint venture company, named Meroil Tank, reported a 1.5 million euro ($1.64 million) net profit in 2020, according to the latest public records.

Investing.com – Zumiez (NASDAQ:ZUMZ) stock plunged 13% Friday after the company projected its current quarter sales to erode by more than a fifth from a year ago.
It also missed estimates for both sales and earnings in the fourth quarter ended January 29. The company is blaming last year’s stimulus that produced record annual sales for its lackluster forecast, saying sales will be “down meaningfully to the prior year.”
Net sales for the first quarter are seen between $215 million and $221 million, down by around 21% at the top end. At the pessimistic end, they could fall by as much as 23%, coming in after a record 2021.
Evidence of the sales weakening is already visible, according to the company. Total first quarter-to-date sales for the 35 days ended March 5 fell about 2%.
The company warned that fixed costs could come to hurt it as sales reduce. Expenses like store wages and travel expenses, all of which it was able to avoid during the pandemic, could return to weigh on earnings, it said.
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter are expected to be break-even to positive 10 cents per diluted share.
Zumiez said it will open around 34 new stores in the current financial year as it seeks to attract more young women and men to its apparel, footwear, and hard goods.
Sales in the fourth quarter were up a mere 4.6% to around $347 million. Quarterly profit on per share basis rose by 2 cents to $1.7.
The company closed the year with lower cash and current marketable securities, using the money for share repurchases and capital expenditures."

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Atlantia expects its core profit to rise by 27% by 2024, it said on Friday, as traffic on motorways and in airports it operates recovers and the infrastructure group expands into adjacent sectors.
Unveiling a new multi-year strategy, the conglomerate controlled by Italy's powerful Benetton family set a 2024 profit goal of 5.1 billion euros ($5.6 billion), a figure matching the investments it expects to deploy over the same period. 
Atlantia, preparing to draw a line under a lengthy legal dispute with Italy's government following the deadly collapse in 2018 of a bridge it operated, projected a 20% rise in revenue to around 7.7 billion euros in 2024 from 6.4 billion in 2021.
""We continue to see ourselves as an infrastructure group, active in a portfolio of assets geographically diversified,"" CEO Carlo Bertazzo told an online investor presentation.
""We want to continue to allocate our capital mainly in our core assets – motorways through [Spanish unit] Abertis, airports and railways,"" he added. 
Bertazzo told analysts Atlantia was ready to provide financial support to Abertis to help it clinch a sizeable transaction in the ""brownfield"" toll-road business - meaning toll roads that are already built and don't need development.
Abertis CEO Francisco Aljaro Navarro told the same presentation the Spanish group was reviewing opportunities in countries where it operated and would only select geographies with a ""robust"" regulatory framework.
Atlantia CEO Bertazzo said it was also important for the group to ""enlarge and diversify"" its portfolio of assets away from its core business.
He indicated Atlantia may be ready to part ways in the future with its 16% stake in German builder Hochtief, which Bertazzo said was not strategic.
The group by June will complete the sale of its domestic motorway subsidiary which was in charge of the bridge that collapsed in 2018.
It has already started using some of the 8 billion euros-plus in proceeds as it adapts its business model to more sustainable and technologically advanced mobility. 
In January it agreed to buy smart mobility company Yunex Traffic for 950 million euros.
""We see business opportunities in e-mobility, energy transition, smart parking, vehicles-to-grid, rail intermodality, all markets that are expected to grow fast by 2030,"" Bertazzo said.
Atlantia is also returning cash to shareholders. It will pay out 900 million euros in dividends this year, two thirds relating to 2021 results and the rest as an interim dividend on 2022 earnings. It also plans a share buyback of up to 2 billion euros.

It said dividends would grow by 3%-5% a year under its new plan.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukraine's two leading suppliers of neon, which produce about half the world's supply of the key ingredient for making chips, have halted their operations as Moscow has sharpened its attack on the country, threatening to raise prices and aggravate the semiconductor shortage.
Some 45% to 54% of the world's semiconductor-grade neon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, comes from two Ukrainian companies, Ingas and Cryoin, according to Reuters calculations based on figures from the companies and market research firm Techcet. Global neon consumption for chip production reached about 540 metric tons last year, Techcet estimates. 
Both firms have shuttered their operations, according to company representatives contacted by Reuters, as Russian troops have escalated their attacks on cities throughout Ukraine, killing civilians and destroying key infrastructure.
The stoppage casts a cloud over the worldwide output of chips, already in short supply after the coronavirus pandemic drove up demand for cellphones, laptops and later cars, forcing some firms to scale back production.
While estimates vary widely about the amount of neon stocks chipmakers keep on hand, production could take a hit if the conflict drags on, according to Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA.
""If stockpiles are depleted by April and chipmakers don't have orders locked up in other regions of the world, it likely means further constraints for the broader supply chain and inability to manufacture the end-product for many key customers,"" he said. 
Before the invasion, Ingas produced 15,000 to 20,000 cubic meters of neon per month for customers in Taiwan, Korea, China, the United States and Germany, with about 75% going to the chip industry, Nikolay Avdzhy, the company's chief commercial officer, said in an email to Reuters. 
The company is based in Mariupol, which has been under siege by Russian forces. On Wednesday, Russian forces destroyed a maternity hospital there, in what Kyiv and Western allies called a war crime. Moscow said the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters.
""Civilians are suffering,"" Avdzhy said by email last Friday, noting that the company's marketing officer could not respond because he had no internet or phone access. 
Cryoin, which produced roughly 10,000 to 15,000 cubic meters of neon per month, and is located in Odessa, halted operations on Feb. 24 when the invasion began to keep employees safe, according to business development director Larissa Bondarenko.
Bondarenko said the company would be unable to fill orders for 13,000 cubic meter of neon in March unless the violence stopped. She said the company could weather at least three months with the plant closed, but warned that if equipment were damaged, that would prove a bigger drag on company finances and make it harder to restart operations quickly. 
She also said she was unsure the company could access additional raw materials for purifying neon.
The Economy Ministry of Taiwan, home to the world's largest contract chip maker TSMC, said that Taiwanese firms had already made advanced preparations and had ""safety stocks"" of neon, so it did not see any supply chain problems in the near term. The statement to Reuters echoed similar remarks from Taiwan's central bank earlier on Friday.
But smaller chipmakers may be harder hit, according to Lita Shon-Roy, president of Techcet.
""The largest chip fabricators, like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Samsung (KS:005930) and TSMC, have greater buying power and access to inventories that may cover them for longer periods of time, two months or more,"" she said. ""However, many other chip fabs do not have this kind of buffer,"" she added, noting that rumors of companies trying to build up inventory have begun to circulate. ""This will compound the issue of supply availability.”
Ukrainian neon is a byproduct of Russian steel manufacturing. The gas, which is also used in laser eye surgery, is produced in China as well, but Chinese prices are rising steadily.
Bondarenko says prices, already under pressure after the pandemic, had climbed by up to 500% from December. According to a Chinese media report that cited Chinese commodity market information provider biiinfo.com, the price of neon gas (99.9% content) in China has quadrupled from 400 yuan/cubic meter in October last year to more than 1,600 yuan/cubic meter in late February. 
Neon prices rose 600% in the run-up to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.

Companies elsewhere could initiate neon production but it would take nine months to two years to ramp up, according to Richard Barnett, chief marketing officer of Supplyframe, which provides market intelligence to companies across the global electronics sectors.
But CFRA's Angelo Zino noted that companies may be unwilling to invest in that process if the supply crunch is seen as temporary.

Investing.com -- Electric vehicle charging firm Blink Charging Co. (NASDAQ:BLNK) shares are down Friday after the company reported lower than expected earnings per share after the close Thursday evening.
The company, which provides Level 2 EV charging stations and networks for homes and businesses, reported a loss per share of 45 cents, below consensus expectations of a 39 cents loss per share. The number also widened from the 24 cents loss per share reported in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Blink shares have fallen over 9% Friday off the back of the earnings miss, putting its share price down around 10% for the year-to-date.
Q4 revenue, however, beat expectations, coming in at $7.95 million, above the $6.9 million anticipated. This was a record for the company, up 224% over the prior-year period and increasing 24% sequentially compared to Q3 2021. In addition, Q4 service revenues increased 471% year-over-year.
2021 revenue grew 236% to $20.9 million compared to 2020 revenue of $6.2 million.
When it comes to charging stations specifically, the company contracted or sold 3,733 in Q4, an increase of 253%.
The company put its robust revenue growth down to strong product sales and service revenues after solid momentum throughout the year.
""As we move through 2022, we are excited about the opportunities we’re seeing to bring our industry-leading charging technology to a broader audience, both in the U.S. and internationally,"" stated Michael Farkas, Blink’s Chairman and CEO."

(Reuters) - The world's biggest eyewear company EssilorLuxottica reported strong sales growth in the fourth quarter, rising further above pre-pandemic levels and boosted by its performance in the United States and its GrandVision acquisition.
Shares in EssilorLuxottica, which owns the Oakley and Ray-Ban sunglass brands and makes sunglasses and spectacle frames for labels including Chanel and Prada (OTC:PRDSY), were up 2.3% after the quarterly results, which slightly beat analysts' forecasts.
The company said fourth-quarter revenue came to 5.58 billion euros ($6.14 billion), including GrandVision, up around 32% from a year earlier and up nearly 35% from the 2019 pre-pandemic level at constant exchange rates. 
Excluding the GrandVision acquisition, fourth-quarter revenue rose 11% from the same period in 2019 pre-pandemic. 
The group acquired over 76% of the Dutch eyewear retailer in July and completed the purchase of remaining shares in January. GrandVision added more stores to the group's retail business, which now generates half of EssilorLuxottica's sales.
Fourth-quarter revenue beat analysts' consensus expectations by 1%, according to RBC.
The company has seen a sharp rebound in sales since last summer, particularly in North America as economies reopened after restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Its shares have risen nearly 8% in the past year. 
EssilorLuxottica said it targeted an adjusted operating profit of between 19% and 20% of revenue by 2026, up from 17% in 2021. 
On Thursday, EssilorLuxottica said in a post on its LinkedIn page that it was temporarily restricting operations in Russia, where it has around 1,000 employees and a network of around 100 Lensmaster stores, citing uncertainties and significant disruptions.
A wave of Western companies have put their business activities in Russia on hold either due to stringent sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine or to show their opposition to the war in Ukraine.
""At this difficult time, the safety of our people remains our priority and we are providing all the support possible to our affected teams in the region,"" Chief Executive Francesco Milleri and his deputy, Paul du Saillant, said in the earnings statement. 
Russia and Ukraine account for less than 200 million euros or 1% of group revenue, executives said in a call with analysts Tuesday.

Overall, business has started out well in 2022, executives said, noting they hadn't seen an impact of inflation on sales or a spillover from the conflict in Ukraine into other regions.

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 10:03AM ET</span>",Defence firms ramp up pitch to exit sustainability wilderness,"By Simon Jessop, Tommy Wilkes and Tim Hepher
LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - Largely ignored by the growing ranks of Europe's socially minded investors, defence firms see a fresh chance to argue for a place in portfolios after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
One asset manager announced last week that it would re-allow investment in defence, a sign that cracks are emerging in widespread opposition to owning defence firms from sustainable investors in Europe. 
Analysts expect more to follow. But for many with a sustainable tilt - defined by some as investing in companies that aim to have a positive impact on the world - it will prove a tough ask.
Rolls Royce (LON:RR), Thales and Airbus have joined a chorus of companies over the last two weeks calling for investors to treat the sector more favourably, arguing security and stability are key to sustainability.
That comes after a year of the industry lobbying European authorities not to exclude defence from an upcoming framework or ""taxonomy"" on socially good investments. 
It also follows years in which investors across Europe have avoided the sector in favour of firms with stronger environmental, social and governance (ESG) profiles, hurting defence shares and raising financing costs.
Most of the funds focused on sustainability that Reuters has spoken to remain cold on defence. But some are eyeing the returns on offer from the region's push to raise security spending.
Sweden's SEB Investment Management announced last week it had overturned a blanket ban on any company deriving more than 5% of its revenue from defence for six of its funds, although the majority of its product range is unchanged, including sustainable funds.
SEB attributed the change to pressure from customers for exposure to defence as Russian troops amassed on the Ukraine border, underlining that fund houses must answer to clients as well as their own sustainability promises.
""We are seeing evidence that a number of large European asset managers are re-evaluating the sector,"" said Luke Sussams, head of ESG in Europe, the Middle East and Africa for investment bank Jefferies. ""The Ukraine-Russia conflict has been a real wake-up call for ESG investors in general.""
Yet others say the sudden redrawing of Europe's security architecture does not mean makers of fighters, missiles and tanks are suddenly sustainable.
""Sustainable investments must fulfil the criterion ""Do no significant harm"" – this is not the case with armaments,"" said Henrik Pontzen, head of ESG at Union Investment. It is sticking to excluding from its sustainable funds any company that earns more than 5% of revenue from arms.
Sasja Beslik, head of sustainability at Danish pension fund PFA, said investors were wrong if they believed they could ensure that any investment in defence went solely towards defending borders.
""What are we going to include tomorrow? Let's include chemical companies that are polluting certain parts of the world, but not the rest. Come on, it's ridiculous,"" he told Reuters.
While funds with a specific sustainable or ethical mandate may find it hard to change tack, others with a looser requirement to ""integrate ESG risks"" have more flexibility.
Sustainable managers typically avoid businesses that earn 5%-plus of revenue from defence, while the vast majority of risk-focused funds just ban those involved with unconventional weapons such as cluster munitions.
UBS analysts noted that rather than outright exclusions some ESG managers prefer engagement. 
According to Morningstar, sustainable funds have a 0.2% weighting to aerospace and defence against the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF's 1.1%. In Europe the underweighting is starker -- 0.2% against 1.6%.
SOCIALLY GOOD OR BAD?
Still, defence lobbyists believe they are now winning the argument, especially after a strong indication that Europe's drive to help funnel investment to socially and environmentally friendly activities would not exclude their industry. 
A report prepared for the European Commission on its 'Social Taxonomy' last month omitted an earlier reference of defence as socially harmful. Lobbyists had feared it would lead to widespread fund exclusions.
With Germany, Sweden and others announcing bigger defence spending since the war in Ukraine, analysts have rushed to upgrade forecasts and share prices have soared.
Calling ESG concerns ""spurious and morally weak"", Agency Partners said in a note that the EU taxonomy debate had clouded the investability and valuations of defence stocks. 
And French warplane manufacturer Dassault Aviation hit out at a ""schizophrenic"" situation that saw European defence spending rising only for U.S. rivals to benefit, because European suppliers were being harmed by the EU taxonomy drive.
""Taxonomy is not an effective weapon against current threats,"" CEO Eric Trappier, who also represents the French defence industry, told reporters. ""It is a weapon used against us, the defence industry, and the proof is that... its small suppliers are starting to have problems with their banks."" 
FIGHTBACK
The defence industry's fight is far from over, however. 
Including defence in the EU social's taxonomy would ""fly in the face of the 'Do No Significant Harm principle'"", said Hortense Bioy, sustainable research director at Morningstar.
European technical advisers are also backing a 5% revenue threshold to exclude defence companies from the bloc's planned 'EU Ecolabel', which is designed to help consumers identify more environmentally friendly and socially good products.
A spokesperson said the Commission would ""carefully reflect on all the implications of those exclusions for defence-related activities"", but stressed no final decision had been made. 
For a fragmented industry that can struggle to compete against rivals in the United States where ESG concerns are less commonplace, winning hearts and minds of investors is crucial.

""Even if some banks and investors are coming back to defence, it doesn't mean they all are,"" said Jan Pie, secretary general of European defence industry lobby ASD, arguing that longer term, defence needed more reliable financial backers.
""It shouldn't be public opinion that decides whether to finance the defence industry.""

(Reuters) - Japanese brands Uniqlo and  Japan Tobacco  (OTC:JAPAF) made U-turns and said they were stopping business in Russia, joining the corporate crowd shunning Moscow on Thursday, and Britain escalated sanctions against oligarchs including Chelsea soccer club owner Roman Abramovich.
Investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) became the first U.S. bank to quit Russia, and global grain trader  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) said it had suspended new export business from Russia, although it is still crushing oil seeds for the domestic market..
Russian President Vladimir Putin said that his country would emerge stronger and more independent from Western sanctions, which he said were inevitable. The corporate condemnation of Russia's attack on Ukraine is spreading, but Putin, who calls the war a special military operation, said he had no choice.
The fallout is also broadening among Putin's personal allies, as Abramovich and six others including Igor Sechin, CEO of Russian energy giant Rosneft, became the highest-profile oligarchs sanctioned by Britain since the invasion.
The action effectively puts Chelsea under UK government control, halting any disposal, and stopping new ticket or merchandise sales.
Britain's move came as the first major mining company, Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), said it is cutting all ties with Russian businesses, including fuel and other materials' sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi, where possible, and the use of an alumina refinery in Ireland.
Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and Nintendo suspended deliveries of their gaming consoles; Sony's music businesses and Warner Music Group also stopped business in Russia.
HOTELIERS STEP BACK
Major fast-food, drinks and consumer goods companies, led by McDonalds and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), have stepped back from Russia following pressure from customers in the West.
Hotelier Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) closed its Moscow office and joined Hilton and Hyatt in suspending developments.
The exodus by Japanese companies picked up steam, with many describing the decisions in practical terms.
Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing had told Japanese media that the company would continue operating its 50 stores in Russia because ""clothing is a necessity of life,"" but on Thursday the company said it could not continue business in Russia because of ""a number of difficulties."" 
Japan Tobacco, which controls about one-third of Russia's tobacco market, said its subsidiary would stop investment, marketing and a launch of a heated tobacco product.
Japan's Shiseido suspended exports of its cosmetics to Russia from Europe as well as advertising and promotions, and Mitsubishi Electric (OTC:MIELY) said it would stop exports to Russia, where operations were in a ""difficult situation"".
Japanese construction machinery supplier Hitachi (OTC:HTHIY) said it would stop exports and cease most operations in Russia except for vital electrical power facilities, following similar exits by American industrial companies  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT), 3M Co, Deere (NYSE:DE) and Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON).
""We took multiple factors including the supply chain situation into account,"" a spokesperson for Hitachi said, echoing a statement from Caterpillar. 
While some companies such as Ford and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, others including Japanese automaker Toyota have taken a more neutral stance, blaming a halt in production in Russia on logistical hurdles.
Swiss bank  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) flagged a roughly $900 million Russian credit exposure, including lending to wealthy clients, following disclosures from Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY).
Suzuki's Hungarian factory suspended car exports to Russia and Ukraine, about 10,000 vehicles a year, in one of the first signs of the conflict hitting the broader economy in the region.
Sweeping Western sanctions have isolated Russia, while shippers have suspended routes and European Union leaders plan to phase out buying Russian energy in a bid to be less dependent on the country.
The war, which entered its third week on Thursday, has killed thousands of people and rendered more than two million refugees.
It has decimated the Russian rouble, roiled stock markets and prices of oil and other commodities have skyrocketed, adding to global inflation that was surging even before the conflict began.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube and Google Play store are suspending all payment-based services in Russia, including subscriptions, as sanctions start to pose banking challenges.
They had earlier stopped selling online ads in Russia.
PAY IN ROUBLES
Russia plans to order local airlines to pay for leased aircraft in roubles and bar them from returning planes to foreign companies if the latter cancel the lease, according to a draft law published on Thursday.
Lessor BOC Aviation said it had 18 planes worth $935 million leased to Russian airlines that could be affected by the sanctions and insurance policy cancellations.
Moscow, which calls the war a ""special military operation,"" has warned it might nationalise idled foreign assets in retaliation against Western sanctions.

Rio Tinto, which owns an 80% stake in a joint venture with Russian aluminium producer Rusal, said it was ""in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business."" 
Italian energy group Eni suspended the purchase of oil from Russia and said it was watching developments closely with regards to gas procurement.

1183,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 09:57AM ET</span>",Generali struggle intensifies as investor plots own CEO candidate,"By Stefano Bernabei and Gianluca Semeraro
ROME (Reuters) - Generali (MI:GASI)'s second-biggest investor, construction tycoon Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, plans to put forward his own candidate to lead Italy's biggest insurer, challenging the reappointment of chief executive Philippe Donnet.
Caltagirone and fellow billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, Generali's third-largest investor, are battling its single biggest shareholder, Italian investment bank Mediobanca (OTC:MDIBY), over control of the insurance group.
In the complex world of Italian business, the Generali power struggle is also likely to have implications for the Milanese merchant bank, which once sat at the heart of corporate Italy. 
Del Vecchio, the founder of global eyewear giant Luxottica, is also the main shareholder in Mediobanca, in which Caltagirone too has built a stake.
The two sides in the Generali battle will face off at the end of April when its shareholders are due to meet to elect a new board of directors.
Caltagirone said in a statement on Thursday that he would present a slate of nominees for Generali's board which would include candidates for both chief executive and chairman.
Generali shares were 1.49% higher on Friday, rising alongside other insurers, the while FTSE Mib index was up 0.5%.
Generali's outgoing board has proposed current CEO Donnet for a third term, a decision which was opposed by Caltagirone and a representative for Del Vecchio.
Both Caltagirone and Del Vecchio's representative have since stepped down from the board. 
The two had struck a shareholder pact in September over a combined 16% stake, but Caltagirone quit the accord in January to avoid drawing regulatory scrutiny. 
Following a request by Generali, Italian market and insurance authorities are looking into whether the two should have sought a prior authorisation, something which could result into their voting rights being capped at 10% in April.
Caltagirone is expected to reveal in the coming days the names of his candidates. He is also due to present an alternative strategy to the one Donnet put forward in December, a person with knowledge of the matter said, adding that consultants Bain had been hired for the project.
Caltagirone has so far held his cards close to his chest, with analysts saying he had to find a CEO candidate of high standing, but that person risked ending up without a job.

Former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) banker Claudio Costamagna could be a candidate for the role of chairman in Caltagirone's list, a person close to the matter said.
Generali has put forward current Borsa Italiana Chairman Andrea Sironi for the role of chairman under the list the board could finalise on Monday when it meets to approve full-year results.

Prices of lithium and nickel, key materials used in batteries that power electric vehicles, have skyrocketed due to the Western sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
That, in turn, has added to supply-chain disruptions, which have plagued the industry since the outbreak of the pandemic.
Rivian expects these challenges to extend through 2022. 
""The recent spike in core raw materials raises serious issues with (battery electric vehicle) economics,""  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Colin Langan said, while highlighting the 130% rise in nickel prices and a 16% to 88% rise in prices of cobalt, lithium and aluminum this year.
Rivian shares have nearly halved in value since their blockbuster initial public offering in November. They opened at $38.32 on Friday and hit a fresh low of $38.

At least six brokerages, including Piper Sandler, trimmed their price targets on the stock. Piper, which has an ""overweight"" rating, however, said supply-chain constraints are temporary and might not be a big enough reason to sell the stock.
Rivian Chief Executive Officer R.J. Scaringe said the company was developing a portfolio of battery solutions, including lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, to hedge against soaring nickel prices.

(Reuters) - AIA Group (OTC:AAGIY) Ltd on Friday launched a $10 billion share buyback plan and declared a higher final dividend on strong growth in 2021, but warned of near-term pain from a recent outbreak of coronavirus infections in Hong Kong.
The Asia-focussed insurer's value of new business or VONB, which measures expected profit from new premiums and is a key gauge for future growth, rose to $3.37 billion for the year ended Dec. 31, from $2.77 billion a year earlier.
China and Hong Kong accounted for about half of new business growth globally. Mainland China business was the top contributor to VONB, logging a 14% growth, while its Hong Kong business jumped 37%, indicating strong recovery from the pandemic-lows.
Better operating conditions for the Hong Kong-based insurer, which relies on its army of agents, prompted it to announce the buyback plan spread over the next three years. 
""The share buyback represents capital accumulated over time that is surplus to our needs, allowing for capital market stress conditions and retention of capital for strategic and financial flexibility,"" Group Chief Executive Officer Lee Yuan Siong said.
However, the company warned that the recent outbreak of the Omicron variant, especially in Hong Kong, is affecting its new business sales, particularly in the first quarter.

Over the past few weeks, Hong Kong has seen some of the most draconian curbs in place to combat a record surge in coronavirus cases and deaths. China has also seen a rise of locally transmitted coronavirus infections recently.
AIA also declared a final dividend of 108 Hong Kong cents per share, 8% higher than last year, taking the total 2021 dividend to 146 HK cents apiece.

1186,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 09:54AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Higher as Market Rides Out Inflation Blow; Dow Up 330 Pts,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Friday, having absorbed the twin disappointment of unsuccessful Ukrainian peace talks and U.S. inflation hitting its highest in over 40 years on Thursday.
By 9:50 AM ET (1450 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 338 points, or 1.0% at 33,512 points. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up more modestly, by 0.6% and 0.5% respectively.  All three indices are on course for their fourth weekly loss in five, under pressure from the rising interest rate environment and the war in Ukraine. 
Fresh talk of the possibility of summit meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian presidents has been offset by news that Russia has broadened its air campaign against Ukrainian cities, and also split up the huge armored convoy that has been threatening Ukraine's capital Kyiv for the last week. Analysts say that could be the prelude to an assault on the city, similar to what has been witnessed in Kharkiv and Mariupol. Russian President Vladimir Putin also said on state TV Friday that he will deploy 'volunteers' from Syria to bolster his forces in Ukraine, which have only captured one major city in two weeks of fighting. 
The market's attention is drifting back to next week's Federal Reserve meeting. The February inflation report, which showed a broad rise in 'sticky' prices such as rent and services as well as more volatile elements such as food and energy, has given no room for speculation that the Fed will soft-pedal on tightening monetary policy. Even the European Central Bank, which has run an unabashedly dovish policy for most of the last decade, sent a clear signal at its policy meeting on Thursday that it considers inflation to be the greater threat - despite the fact that the war is likely to hit the Eurozone economy much harder than the U.S. one. 
The impact of the highest inflation in a generation is already being seen. The University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment index for March fell to its lowest since 2011, the reading of 59.7 being comfortably below the 61.4 expected. Expectations of inflation for the next 12 months rose to 5.4% from 4.9% but longer-term expectations stayed unchanged at 3.0%, suggesting that many consumers are still inclined to see the current conditions as transitory.
Individual stocks standing out included DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), which slumped another 20% after issuing a much-reduced growth forecast, emphatically signalling that the boom in demand from pandemic-related behavioral changes is over. DocuSign stock is now down 75% from its peak and has, like many other growth stocks, unwound all its gains since March 2020. 
 Rivian Automotive  (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock also fell 7.3% to a new all-time low after the EV maker nearly halved its production forecast for 2022 owing to supply chain difficulties. The company also posted a thumping $2.46 billion loss in the fourth quarter, caused in part by accounting effects from its IPO.
Elsewhere, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock fell 0.1% and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) stock fell 2.7% after EU and U.K. regulators launched a formal probe into suspected price-fixing in the digital advertising market by the owners of Google and Facebook. Meta's underperformance was also partly driven by fears that its policy on the Ukraine war could come back to haunt it. News reports suggest that the company is suspending its usual policy of a ban on calls for violence in order to allow a voice to those defending Ukraine. "
1187,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 09:46AM ET</span>",Swiss gov't proposes public liquidity backstop for big banks,"ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government wants to set up a new backstop allowing the provision of state-guaranteed cash should one of the country's big banks fail, it said on Friday, as it seeks to bolster major lenders' crisis resilience and limit the risk of economic turmoil from any banking failure.
Switzerland, like other countries, has adopted ""too big to fail"" (TBTF) rules since the Global Financial Crisis to ensure major banks hold enough capital and liquidity to absorb shocks, with new adjustments set to take effect in July.
Solving the TBTF problem has been a priority for U.S. and European regulators after several banks, including Switzerland's biggest bank UBS, were bailed out by taxpayers during the financial crisis.
But the Swiss government cautioned on Friday that scenarios remained conceivable in which a major bank would face difficulties in resolving in an orderly manner should it fail.
""Even with higher liquidity requirements, situations are conceivable in which a systemically important bank's liquid assets are not enough to perform successful resolution,"" the government said in a statement. ""In order to increase market participants' confidence in the ability of a recapitalised and solvent systemically important bank to survive, it is planned to provide a third line of temporary additional liquidity via a public liquidity backstop.""
Liquidity backstops help provide insurance that banks will have access to cash in a crisis, thereby mitigating the risk of bank runs, or customers and counterparties pulling out of business with a failing bank over concerns for their money.
The government's proposed backstop would allow the Swiss National Bank to provide funds to any systemically important bank in the event of failure, in the form of a state-guaranteed loan.
Alongside UBS, Switzerland's second-largest lender  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) is classified as systemically important, as are unlisted lenders Raiffeisen Group, Zuercher Kantonalbank and PostFinance.

Internationally, a public liquidity backstop is part of the standard crisis toolkit,"" the Swiss government said, cautioning it ""should not be confused with a state bailout.""
It tasked the finance ministry with preparing draft legislation by mid-2023.

LONDON (Reuters) -Confiscating the assets of companies that have fled Russia since the invasion of Ukraine would shatter investor confidence for decades and take Russia back to the calamitous days of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, metals magnate Vladimir Potanin has said.
Potanin, president and biggest shareholder of Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and refined nickel, said Russia should respond with pragmatism to its exclusion from swathes of the global economy.
""We should not try to 'slam the door' but endeavour to preserve Russia's economic position in those markets which we spent so long cultivating,"" Potanin, 61, said on the Telegram messaging app. 
Potanin, one of the most prominent Russian billionaires who is not sanctioned by the West, said confiscating assets from companies that had left would put Russia out in the cold for decades, as far as investors were concerned:
""It would take us back 100 years to 1917. And the consequences - a global lack of confidence in Russia from investors - we would feel for many decades.""
Russia's economy is facing the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after the West imposed sweeping sanctions across Russia's financial and corporate sectors following Moscow's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Thursday that the government proposed putting companies that had left Russia into external administration. 
The exact mechanisms of that are unclear, though there is a fierce debate within the Russian elite about how severe Moscow's reaction to Western sanctions should be, officials and businessmen said.
Putin said Russia would remain open for business and did not intend to close itself off from those who still wanted to do business.
But many do not - at least for now. 
BP (NYSE:BP) said last month it was abandoning its stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft while companies ranging from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co to Toyota and IKEA have shuttered their businesses in Russia.
'WE MUST BE WISER' 
Potanin’s upbringing as the son of a high-ranking Soviet trade official and an education at Moscow’s elite diplomatic academy have always set him slightly apart from other oligarchs who rose from rags to riches in the chaos of the 1990s.
The privatisation deals under President Boris Yeltsin gave Potanin and other oligarchs control over some of the best assets of a former superpower, though their clout was eroded under Putin as a new group of former spies put some of Russia's biggest oil production units under state control.
Besides being the world's largest producer of palladium and high-grade nickel, MMC Norilsk Nickel is a major producer of platinum and copper. It also produces cobalt, rhodium, silver, gold, iridium, ruthenium, selenium, tellurium and sulphur.
Potanin said some countries used sanctions as a way to edge out competition, urging Moscow to consider its moves carefully.
He also urged Moscow to remove restrictions on servicing Russia's foreign currency debt, which he said totalled $480 billion. He said a technical default on interest payments could trigger demands for the full principal to be paid.
""This fully applies to major public companies,"" Potanin said. Russia said on Sunday that sovereign bond payments will depend on sanctions.
""We see that the West's own economies have suffered by imposing sanctions against Russia. So we must be wiser and avoid a scenario under which our sanctions hit us,"" Potanin said. 

Putin says the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is essential to ensure Russian security after NATO admitted members up to Russia's borders and Western countries supported pro-Western leaders in Kyiv.
Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and the United States and its European and Asian allies have condemned the Russian invasion. China has called for calm.

The WTI crude oil surged to about a 14-year high earlier this week. U.S. President Joe Biden's announcement of a ban on Russian oil and energy imports on Tuesday raised further concerns over surging crude oil prices.

Investing.com – Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) stock traded 2.2% higher in premarket Friday after the beauty retailer beat fourth-quarter estimates.
The company reaped the gains arising out of more people returning to work and spending more on fragrances and skin care. As of January 29, the company operated 1,308 stores, 44 more than a year ago.
Q4 net sales jumped over 24% to $2.7 billion as Covid-19 restrictions eased and consumer confidence returned. Comparable sales were up more than 21% as more people shopped and average ticket size also grew.
Selling, general and administrative expenses were higher by a small margin of 0.4 percentage points to near 24% due to higher pay and incentives, partially offset by leverage in marketing expenses due to higher sales.
“The beauty category is healthy and growing, and we are confident the recovery that began in 2021 will continue, as consumers maintain their self-care routines, become more resilient to Covid surges, and engage in more leisure and social activities,” CEO Dave Kimbell said in a statement.
He listed wage and supply chain cost pressures as challenges in the current year while it attempts to exceed the “exceptional performance” in 2021 when net sales jumped over 40% to $8.6 billion.
The company’s targets for 2022 include at least $9.05 billion in annual sales with an ambitious aim of making it $9.15 billion. Comparable sales are seen up 3-4%.
Four days ago, the company announced a $2 billion share buyback. This replaces the little that was left out of its previous repurchase program of $1.6 billion, the company said.  "

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Thursday issued final rules eliminating the need for automated vehicle manufacturers to equip fully autonomous vehicles with manual driving controls to meet crash standards.
Automakers and tech companies have faced significant hurdles to deploying automated driving system (ADS) vehicles without human controls because of safety standards written decades ago that assume people are in control.
Last month, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and its self-driving technology unit Cruise petitioned the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for permission to build and deploy a self-driving vehicle without human controls like steering wheels or brake pedals.
The rules revise regulations that assume vehicles ""will always have a driver's seat, a steering wheel and accompanying steering column, or just one front outboard passenger seating position.""
""For vehicles designed to be solely operated by an ADS, manually operated driving controls are logically unnecessary,"" the agency said.
The new rules, which were first proposed in March 2020, emphasize automated vehicles must provide the same levels of occupant protection as human-driven vehicles.
""As the driver changes from a person to a machine in ADS-equipped vehicles, the need to keep the humans safe remains the same and must be integrated from the beginning,"" said NHTSA Deputy Administrator Steven Cliff.

NHTSA's rule says children should not occupy what is traditionally known as the ""driver's"" position, given that the driver's seating position has not been designed to protect children in a crash, but if a child is in that seat, the car will not immediately be required to cease motion.
NHTSA said existing regulations do not currently bar deploying automated vehicles as long as they have manual driving controls, and as it continues to consider changing other safety standards, manufacturers may still need to petition NHTSA for an exemption to sell their ADS-equipped vehicles.

1195,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 08:31AM ET</span>",Apple to chime louder in Asia with 5G iPhone SE,"By Siddarth S and Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s low-cost 5G model should enhance the iPhone maker's appeal in Asia where it is in a stiff battle with multiple rivals from Samsung (KS:005930) to Vivo, analysts believe.
After focusing on high-end phones during the pandemic-induced supply chain crisis, Apple this week unveiled 5G connectivity to its iPhone SE - for $429 - which is likely to attract more lower-end buyers in emerging markets.
""The new 3rd gen iPhone SE could be effective in gaining incremental share among price sensitive consumers, especially in Asia,"" Cowen and Company brokerage said, citing China and India in particular.
Counterpoint Research said the earlier 4G iPhone SE accounted for 12% of total iPhone sales from its launch in Q2 2020 until the end of 2021, with Japan the biggest market after the United States.
'DEMAND TO OPEN UP'
""This time we expect demand to open up more across other markets like Europe, SE (South East) Asia and Korea – regions where many consumers stayed away because of the lack of 5G support (for the older SE),"" Counterpoint Research analyst Sujeong Lim said.
The world's most valuable company with a market capitalization around $2.6 trillion, Apple achieved its highest ever market share in China at the end of last year, surpassing Huawei to become the best seller, according to a previous Counterpoint. 
Cowen and Company analyst Krish Sankar said the new small-screen 5G phone's $30 price hike from the 4G version should cover most extra costs from the enhanced technology, though margins would be lower compared to the $699 iPhone 13 mini.

He estimated the iPhone SE would generate gross margin between 42%-54%, or roughly half the gross profit for each device compared with the iPhone 13 mini.

The Canadian operations of Russian steelmaker Evraz, of which Abramovich is the largest shareholder, will not be affected by the move, Trudeau said at a news conference. 
""The sanctions on Russian officials and oligarchs like Abramovich are directed at them so that they cannot profit or benefit from economic activities in Canada or the hard work of Canadians working in companies that they have investments in,"" Trudeau said. 
""We are obviously going to watch carefully but we are confident that this will not impact the hard working Canadians who are doing good work in companies across the country."" 
On Monday, Canada slapped sanctions on 10 individuals close to the Russian leadership over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Trudeau said he would not rule out an airlift to help Ukrainians who have fled the country since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. He said his government was looking at all options and planned to do more to help.

Canada and its allies will remain united in their conviction that Russian President ""Vladimir Putin has made a terrible mistake and will end up losing, despite how many bombs he can drop on hospitals, or perhaps even because of it. There is no win in this for him,"" Trudeau said.
Moscow denies it has been attacking civilians in what it calls a ""special operation"" to disarm and ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine.

Investing.com – Pearson (NYSE:PSO) ADRs surged 21% in premarket trading Friday on a Bloomberg report that Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) is evaluating a cash offer for the education and publishing company.
The stock had risen earlier in the morning following a report on the Betaville blog about a possible approach for the company.
Apollo has time till April 8 to announce a firm intention to make an offer or to withdraw, according to U.K. takeover rules.
Europe’s largest activist investor Cevian Capital currently owns 10.2% of Pearson, making it the company’s largest shareholder.
The company, after seeing its traditional business of college publishing decline, has pivoted to the ‘digital first’ game, selling directly to consumers via its Pearson+ app and to businesses looking to train staff.
The company closed December with 2.75 million registered users on its app including 133,000 paid subscriptions. It recently acquired Clutch Prep, an online video-based learning service to fuel Pearson+ with original video tutorials.
Demand for assessment and qualification services grew 19% in the year. Growth in the IT sector led to a 19% growth in professional certification. US student assessment and English language learning rose 17% each, the latter benefiting from the recovery in both international courseware and Pearson Test of English.
The British company reported 2021 adjusted operating profit of 385 million pounds ($504 million) on sales of 3.42 billion pounds. It expects 2022 revenue to be higher.
The company is confident of getting 416 million pounds in adjusted operating profit in 2022, in line with current market expectations. The higher education business will continue being a drag on operations although the revenue decline should slow this year, according to the company. 
It expects pricing pressure to continue due to the shift from print to ebooks and Pearson+, and from bundles to digital-only."

(Reuters) -Boeing Co is yet to see any respite from a freeze in deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner - but that has not stopped it testing suppliers' capacity to meet output scenarios as high as seven a month by end-2023, three people with knowledge of the matter said.
The planemaker has stopped making public predictions on when it will win approval from U.S. regulators to resume deliveries, halted for nearly a year by factory defects in a still-running saga that is costing $5.5 billion overall.
But, the people said, it has discussed what some analysts consider ambitious scenarios with parts makers as it surveys an industry crippled by successive crises and now facing labor and materials shortages deepened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s production strategy hinges on several key unknowns including when deliveries restart, how quickly it can reduce an overhang of more than 100 undelivered 787s and the extent to which the Ukraine crisis dampens already weak demand.
While some industry sources have pegged a delivery restart as early as next month, the date is increasingly under scrutiny with April just days away.
Boeing's recovery plan could see it increase the current rock-bottom monthly rate of two 787s to three around May, if deliveries have started by then, and again to four around November, two of the people said.
From there, suppliers have been asked to be ready to tackle rates as high as seven a month around October 2023, if requested, the sources added. 
That is more than most analysts reckon the market will absorb and the sources stressed no decision has been made on what, for now, remains purely a planning scenario.
The more Boeing produces the harder it may be to shift the backlog of undelivered planes.
Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu this week estimated monthly output would stay at two in 2022, rising to 3.5 in 2023 but remaining below 5 ""to facilitate the burndown of inventory"". 
""April delivery restart may be aggressive,"" Kahyaoglu added. 
Boeing has repeatedly referred questions on the timing to the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Boeing declined comment on the supplier targets and pointed to comments in January when it said the 787 program remained at a low rate, with an expected gradual return to five a month.
Planemakers frequently test scenarios to keep the supply chain in battle mode ready for the next phase of competition. 
""We will run our rate as low as we can while we burn our inventory as fast as we can,"" Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said in January, adding Boeing would monitor rates as demand grows.
RAMP-UP
The industry has meanwhile received mixed signals on demand for wide-body jets which had peaked well before the pandemic.
Boeing has said it sees a full recovery in airline traffic that underpins plane sales by the end of 2024. 
But it has given what appears to be cautious guidance to one supplier, saying that production for major 787 parts could reach pre-pandemic levels by 2026-2027, one industry source said.
Forecasts for the second half of the decade are still at a very preliminary stage, analysts say.
""Overall, our projections for the three-phase commercial market recovery remain unchanged, and we still assume passenger traffic will return to 2019 levels in the 2023 to 2024 timeframe,"" a Boeing spokesperson said.
Italy's Leonardo, which builds two fuselage sections for the 787 in southern Italy, said on Friday it plans to deliver just over 30 pairs of sections to Boeing this year, up from 28 last year.
Before the pandemic, Boeing was building around 12 of the carbon-composite jets per month, a rate dragged down partially by China-U.S. trade tensions.

Last month, the U.S. FAA revoked Boeing's ability to self-certify newly built 787 aircraft ahead of delivery, raising another potential hurdle to Boeing's plans.
Asked in January whether 787 deliveries would resume in April, Calhoun said, ""That's up to the FAA, and we're going to let them do what they have to do.""

Investing.com – DocuSign Inc. (NASDAQ:DOCU) stock plunged 17% in premarket Friday after the company’s 2023 revenue growth projection came in at less than half of the previous year’s pace.
A share buyback plan of up to $200 million failed to make any impact in shoring up the share.
The company was one of the biggest winners of the pandemic as companies, forced to adopt remote work, turned to its digital solutions to onboard and engage with employees. E-signatures of documents became commonplace. As economies reopen, more people are returning to work, lessening the demand for its solutions.
DocuSign sees 2023 revenue to be not more than $2.48 billion, just over 18% year-on-year. In comparison, 2022 revenue grew 45% to $2.1 billion.
Annual billings are seen around $2.71 at the center of its guidance range, just about a 13% growth compared to the 37% jump in 2022.
Adjusted operating is also seen shrinking by 1 to 3 percentage points.
Last month, the company tied up with Zoom to enable virtual, face-to-face signing up of employees.
Fourth quarter revenue rose 35% to $581 million. Adjusted profit per share was 48 cents."

The Softbank-backed firm said it expects full-year revenue between $3.35 billion and $3.5 billion, a 30%-36% rise from its 2021 revenue.
The COVID-19 pandemic has pushed companies to offer employees to work from places other than their offices, benefiting workspace providers such as WeWork, which offers workstations, private offices and customized floors.
Softbank-backed WeWork's business has also recovered due to easing of COVID-19 curbs, after work-from-home arrangements last year weighed heavily on the company amid reduced occupancy and higher operating costs.
The switch to a hybrid work model had also lifted WeWork's London-listed rival IWG, which reported a smaller loss on Tuesday.
WeWork, which went public in October last year after a near two-year struggle, was aided further by chief executive Sandeep Mathrani's push to cut costs by exiting unprofitable leases and selling non-core assets.
On Friday, WeWork said it expects revenue between $900 million and $1 billion in the third and fourth quarter of 2022, which is the range it expects to become profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis.
Long-term lease obligations, a closely-watched metric given the company generally leases real estate, fell about 11% to $17.93 billion as of Dec. 31.

New desk sales for the fourth quarter, on the other hand, rose to 87,000 from 84,000 in the third quarter.
Revenue rose about 9% quarter-on-quarter to $718 million.

Yum China Holdings (NYSE:YUMC), the owner of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut restaurants in China, said it may have to delist from the New York stock exchange by 2024 after U.S. authorities said it had failed to provide access to audit documents.
Its Hong Kong-listed shares fell as much as 12% on Friday, having closed 11% lower in New York. 
Washington is demanding complete access to the books of U.S-listed Chinese companies, but Beijing bars foreign inspection of working papers from local accounting firms - a long-simmering auditing dispute that puts hundreds of billions of dollars of U.S. investments at stake.
In December, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) said it had identified 273 companies that were at risk, without disclosing names. It named five of these firms including Yum China for the first time this week. 
Shares of other Chinese companies identified by the SEC, including  BeiGene  (NASDAQ:BGNE) Ltd, ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) Inc,  Zai Lab  (NASDAQ:ZLAB) Limited and HUTCHMED (China) Limited also tumbled on the news. 
In an apparent attempt ease investor panic, China's securities regulator said on Friday it was confident it would reach an agreement with U.S. counterparts to solve the dispute.
""We always adhere to the spirit of openness and cooperation, and are willing to resolve the issue ... through regulatory cooperation,"" the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement early on Friday, calling the latest SEC statement ""normal procedure.""
The CSRC and China's Ministry of Finance have recently been in continuous communication and dialogue with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and ""have made positive progress,"" it said. 
Separately, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters on Friday the discussions were proceeding smoothly. 
""The next step for both parties is to continue to advance in depth on more details,"" said one source. The other source said a consensus was expected ""as soon as possible."" 
SEEKING SOLUTIONS 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index fell as much as 9% on Friday, before recouping some losses to close down 4.3%. 
BeiGene, whose shares fell 4.9% in Hong Kong and 6% in New York, said in a filing it was seeking solutions.
ACM Research said it was looking for solutions and Zai Lab said its inclusion ""will not materially impact operations."" HUTCHMED did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Group, said the SEC move was not totally unexpected, but investors' reaction was understandable given heightened geopolitical tensions.
""The atmosphere now is bad. We have Sino-U.S. frictions, the Ukraine crisis, prospects of rate hikes and more,"" Yip said. ""So it's natural for investors to look on the dark side.""
Bruce Pang, an analyst at China Renaissance, said the main reason the five companies were identified by the SEC was that they were the first few companies that already filed their 2021 annual reports. 

""However, this list has returned delisting risk to the forefront, as regulators look to proceed step by step with stricter requirements on disclosure and compliance.""
The SEC has given these companies until March 29 to submit evidence to dispute their identification.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Friday, ending a volatile week on a positive note on the back of raised hopes of a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 390 points, or 1.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 55 points, or 1.3%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 220 points, or 1.6%.
These gains followed a Reuters report quoting Russian President Vladimir Putin as stating that there were certain ""positive shifts"" in talks with Ukraine, lifting hopes for a ceasefire in a war that is now in its third week.
The main Wall Street indices all closed lower Thursday after talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries failed to make progress, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average now down 1.3% on the week, potentially registering its fifth negative week in a row for the first time since May 2019. 
The war in Ukraine has driven up the costs of oil and other commodities, prompting fears that the Federal Reserve will have to lift interest rates more rapidly than previously expected.
Consumer prices rose 7.9% in February over last year, the largest annual increase in 40 years, data showed on Thursday, and this is before the sharp commodity price rises caused by Russia's war against Ukraine are factored in.
The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lift interest rates by 25 basis points when it meets next week, the likely start of a series of interest rate hikes to curb inflation. 
Goldman Sachs cut its full-year GDP growth forecast this year to 1.75% from 2.0%, with the influential investment bank warning the probability of a U.S. recession in the next year may be as much as 35%.
The data slate is quiet Friday, with only consumer sentiment data from the University of Michigan due. However, this will give investors an insight into how households are faring as rising price pressures erode spending power. 
In corporate news, Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) reported a hefty fourth quarter net loss of $2.46 billion after the close Thursday, and the EV-maker halved its production target for this year amid supply chain issues.
Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) forecast strong fourth quarter profit as the software firm expects its heavy cloud investments to pay off, while DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) issued weak revenue guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year. 
Additionally, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), will be in the spotlight after regulators in the EU and U.K. opened antitrust probes into the pair over the pair’s 2018 advertising deal.
Oil prices traded higher Friday as the talks around lifting sanctions on Iran were paused, further delaying the possibility of crude exports from the Persian Gulf country entering the global market.
That said the market still looked set for the largest weekly drop since November 2021, amid uncertainty over global production levels. 
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.4% higher at $107.50 a barrel, heading for a weekly drop of around 8% after touching a high of $130.50, while the Brent contract rose 1.6% to $111.09, set for a weekly fall of about 7% after hitting a 14-year high of $139.13. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.9% to $1,982.65/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.1011."

Investing.com – DiDi Global Inc. ADR (NYSE:DIDI) plunged 13% in premarket Friday on a Bloomberg report that the Chinese ride-hailing firm has suspended the process for a Hong Kong market debut, putting a question mark over its plans to bring the listing closer home.
According to Bloomberg, the firm has failed to meet Cyberspace Administration of China’s demands of overhauling its systems for handling sensitive user data. Its main apps, removed from local app stores last year, will remain suspended for the time being.
The company had, in December, announced its plan to delist in the U.S. and pursue a listing in Hong Kong on landing under the cybersecurity probe in its home country. It had then said its NYSE-listed stock will be converted into tradable shares on another stock exchange.
News that the company had landed in the crosshairs of the Chinese regulators became public soon after its June 30 debut on NYSE, ensuring that the share has rarely traded above its issue price of $14. It closed at $3.38 Thursday.
According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the company had been advised to delay its initial public offering, pending a review of its data-handling practices. The company ignored the advice, only to find itself in all sorts of legal troubles later.
As more and more Chinese companies have got listed on American exchanges over the last few years, authorities there have become increasingly uncomfortable with the vast trove of data they possess and that they may be asked to share with American regulators to comply with listing norms.
According to Bloomberg, DiDi has since explored several alternatives, including hiving off data to a third-party Chinese firm and selling a stake to state-backed companies."

Ghosn, the architect of the Renault-Nissan auto alliance, has been fighting multiple probes since fleeing to Lebanon from Japan in late 2019, and has said he hopes to clear his name in financial misconduct cases against him.
Ghosn was chairman of both Nissan (OTC:NSANY) and Mitsubishi and chief executive of  Renault  (PA:RENA) when he was arrested in Japan in 2018 on charges of under-reporting his salary and using company funds for personal use. He has denied wrongdoing.
Japanese prosecutors sought legal assistance from Switzerland to get documents from bank accounts owned by an associate of Ghosn. Zurich prosecutors agreed last year to hand them over, which prompted an appeal from the unidentified associate that the Federal Criminal Court said on Friday it had rejected.

""The Japanese authorities have concrete indications that funds of allegedly criminal origin may have been deposited in two accounts in the complainant's name"" at two unidentified banks, the verdict said.
The verdict did not give the name of the business associate who filed the appeal. Zurich prosecutors identified him only as an Arab businessman whose accounts in question were at two Zurich-based banks they did not name.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian aerospace and defence group Leonardo believes Russia's invasion of Ukraine will accelerate plans to create European common defence capabilities and expects to see higher military spending.
""I am sure this tragic event will create higher coordination and spending in defence (in Europe),"" Leonardo Chief Executive Alessandro Profumo told an analysts call, adding that Leonardo was already part of several EU programmes including the recently signed EuroMale air drone and Tempest fighter jet project.
In addition, EU countries also needed to cooperate more on land defence, Profumo said.
Last month, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced a 100 billion euro ($109.82 billion) new fund - worth twice last year's annual defence budget - to modernize its military, including buying armed drones and new fighter jets.
Italy, expected to spend 26 billion euros on defence this year, is also looking to increase its military spending, Prime Minister Mario Draghi said last week.
Denmark, Poland and Sweden have all said they will ramp up defence spending with war at their doorstep.
The state-controlled group expects its cash flow to more than double this year compared with 2021, reaching 500 million euros.
Cash generation is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, driven by an increase in sales coming from its governmental and defence businesses, CFO Alessandra Genco said.
Last year 88% of its 14.1 billion euros in revenue came from these activities, while the production of parts for commercial aircraft shrunk, forcing the group to restructure its Aerostructures division.
Despite restructuring costs worth 70 million euros and cash absorption from the Aerostructures division, the group recorded a jump in net profit to 587 million euros.
Shares in Leonardo rose more than 12% at 1100 GMT in Milan to touch their highest in more than two years.
The state-controlled group said it had limited activities in civil helicopters in Russia and suspended the business following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Leonardo said it saw growth in the aero, defence and security market averaging about 6% over the next five years and its target market represented about a fifth of the total.

The company added that it had no significant exposure to Russia or Ukraine.

China has been pushing to move from its traditional IPO system, based on regulatory approvals, to a registration-based system of the type used in the United States, a shift that makes investors more responsible for their own investments.

To pave the way for that shift, China introduced rules in January to make it easier for victims of securities fraud to claim compensation, in order to stamp out corporate cheating and protect investors' interests.
The CSRC said it would work to improve the draft rules based on public feedback.

(Reuters) - The Russian invasion of Ukraine has left drugmakers scrambling to find ways for patients enrolled in clinical trials there to receive their medicines as millions seek shelter from bombardment and flee to neighboring countries. 
Ukraine, as well as Russia, have become important countries for studying new drugs because patients there have a dire need for medicines to treat cancer, neurological and gastrointestinal disorders. Russia and surrounding countries account for 10% of people in clinical trials, analysts estimate.
Russia's two-week-old invasion and bombardment of Ukraine has rapidly created a humanitarian crisis, curtailing access to food, water and medical supplies and damaging hospitals in major cities. More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine.
""The health system is becoming engulfed in this conflict, engulfed in this crisis,"" the World Health Organization's emergencies director Mike Ryan said this week. ""We've seen now that some hospitals are being abandoned by the authorities because they simply cannot function.""
Two of the pharmaceutical companies with the most clinical trials in Ukraine - U.S.-based Merck & Co and Swiss drugmaker Roche - said they were assessing how to continue delivering medicines to patients. Combined they have about 100 clinical trials underway there.
At least seven companies, including  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), have said they are experiencing disruptions to trials or patient enrollment in the region. The full scope of delays in Ukraine is unknown. But there were 502 ongoing trials in Ukraine, according to research firm GlobalData.
Roche alone has 33 trials underway in Ukraine accounting for 1.5% of the active trial population across its global studies. 
A Roche spokesperson said the company is trying to identify sites in nearby countries like Poland, Slovakia and Romania that could take on its patients in clinical studies.
""The situation for those patients is currently very challenging and we are actively working on solutions to ensure continued access to treatment for these patients, including if they have left Ukraine and moved to other countries,"" the spokesperson said in an email.
Patient visits to clinics in the Ukraine capital Kyiv run by Laboratory Corporation of America (NYSE:LH), which conducts trials for drugmakers, have been canceled since the week beginning Feb. 21, LabCorp told Reuters. 
Paul Evans, chief executive of Velocity Clinical Research, which does not currently operate in Europe, said the industry faced similar challenges in the region when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.
""But that wasn't an all-out war situation,"" said Evans, adding that conducting research in Ukraine now is nearly impossible. ""You can probably finish existing trials in Russia. But there is probably a disincentive to starting a new trial there.""
PATIENT RECRUITMENT ON PAUSE
Pharmaceutical companies often run large clinical trials across many countries. Ukraine and Russia have been sought after given a willing patient population and lower cost of doing business compared to the United States and Western Europe. 
Jefferies analyst Chris Howerton said trials in Ukraine provide access not only to the experimental drugs, but medicines they are tested against. Trials still enrolling patients will likely shift to other areas if the war drags on, he said.
Merck, which has nearly 60 ongoing trials in Ukraine - the most among all companies operating there - said it had paused enrolling new patients in Ukraine and Russia. The company said on Monday at a conference that it was trying to get products to people enrolled in trials as well as to commercial customers.
Mounting sanctions against Russia do not include medicines. There are 842 trials underway in Russia, making it the sixth largest site for clinical studies worldwide, according to GlobalData.
But experts also cited fresh challenges to conducting clinical business in Russia, such as lack of air travel for investigators outside the country.
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) said it had paused screening and enrollment of new patients in Ukraine, as well as in Russia and its ally Belarus.
Pfizer, which said it was conducting 27 clinical trials in Ukraine, has paused recruitment of new patients.
U.S. drug developer Karuna Therapeutics (NASDAQ:KRTX) suspended enrollment for a trial of its lead schizophrenia drug in Ukraine. Chief Executive Steven Paul told Reuters it could recruit more patients in the United States, if needed.

California-based  Tricida  (NASDAQ:TCDA) Inc said it expected to report data from a trial of its experimental kidney disease drug in the fourth quarter instead of the third, as 15% of patients in the study were from Ukraine.
Said Velocity's Evans: ""In Ukraine, you've got a complete breakdown of society there. You can't possibly be doing clinical research in a war zone like that now.""

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp will scale back domestic production by up to 20% during the months of April, May and June, it said on Friday, to ease the strain on suppliers struggling with shortages of chips and other parts.
The move by Japan's largest automaker is the latest to spotlight the supply-chain difficulties hobbling the global auto industry as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on. The outlook has been further complicated by the crisis in Ukraine.
Toyota plans to reduce domestic production by about 20% in April, about 10% in May and about 5% in June from an earlier production plan, a spokesperson said. Production would still remain high as the previous plan factored in the need to make up for lost output, the spokesperson said.
The automaker's suppliers have been forced to deal with a number of changes to production plans due to chip shortages, and the reduced output should take some of the burden off them, the spokesperson said, declining to comment on the number of cars involved or the financial impact.
Toyota President Akio Toyoda told union members this week that without a sound production plan, suppliers risked becoming ""exhausted"" and that April through June would be ""an intentional cooling off"" period.
U.S. electric vehicle maker Rivian Automotive Inc on Thursday said supply-chain issues could cut its planned production in half this year, to 25,000 vehicles.
Honda Motor Co Ltd has said it would cut production by about 10% in two domestic plants through the end of this month.
Separately, Toyota suspended domestic production for one day at the beginning of this month after a cyberattack on a supplier, a halt that prevented the production of about 13,000 vehicles that day.

Toyota is planning to produce a record 11 million cars in fiscal 2022 as long as it can ensure a stable supply of chips.

Investing.com – Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stocks tumbled 12% in premarket Friday after the EV-maker said its production in 2022 is likely to be 25,000 units as supply chain issues hamper production.
Without the constraints, its factory could make 50,000 vehicles, Rivian said.
Gross margins will be negative, the company said, citing inflationary pressures while it tries to minimize price increases.
Rivian reported a fourth quarter net loss of $2.46 billion, much wider than analysts’ estimates. Revenue of $54 million was well behind expectations.
The company expects a ""significant"" production ramp-up in the second quarter of the EDV-700 van for Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Reuters quoted CEO R. J. Scaringe as saying.
According to the news agency, Rivian is exploring ways to further expand its commercial relationship with Amazon, which owns a 20% stake in the startup and has ordered 100,000 vans. Rivian will begin producing a second Amazon van this year, the EDV-500, which is shorter and narrower than the EDV-700.
Rivian has 83,000 pre-orders for its R1T pickup and R1S utility vehicle as of March 8, up from 71,000 in mid-December.
The company’s stock made a blockbuster debut on November 11 and in no time commanded a market cap of almost $162 billion without a revenue on books, easily surpassing legacy automakers like General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Ford (NYSE:F).
Since then, the stock is now down to less than a fourth of its value but still carries a market cap of over $37 billion when revenue in the full year was $55 million.  
Rivian ended the quarter with $18.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, excluding additional lines of credit."

LONDON (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said it was not withdrawing completely from Russia, drawing anger from investors and contrasting with Wall Street banks which are severing ties with the country over its invasion of Ukraine.
Banks and asset managers have joined many other Western companies in pulling back from Russia following a raft of sanctions on the country.
""We are often asked why we are not withdrawing completely from Russia. The answer is that this would go against our values,"" Chief Executive Christian Sewing said in a note to Deutsche Bank staff on Thursday.
He added that it would not ""be the right thing to do in terms of managing those client relationships and helping them to manage their situation"".
Bill Browder, an investor campaigning to expose corruption, said that by staying in Russia, Germany's biggest bank ""is completely at odds with the international business community and will create backlash, lost reputation and business in the West"".
Russian forces bearing down on Kyiv were regrouping northwest of the Ukrainian capital, satellite pictures showed on Friday, and Britain said Moscow could now be planning an assault on the city within days.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
Tim Ash, senior emerging market sovereign strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said it was ""just not good enough from DB"".
""Perhaps DB needs to take a fresh look at its own ESG (environmental, social, governance) framework,"" he said.
Fund managers are reassessing their approach to governance as a result of the invasion.
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) this week became the first U.S. banks to suspend business in Russia.
Goldman Sachs, which has a credit exposure to Russia of $650 million, said on Thursday it was winding down its business there. Any losses would be ""immaterial,"" according to a source familiar with the situation.
JPMorgan also said it was ""actively unwinding Russian business"" and was not pursuing any new business there. 
JPMorgan has about 160 staff in Moscow. The bank did not list Russia in the top 20 countries where it has the most exposure, in its most recent filings.
The world's biggest insurance brokers Marsh and Aon (NYSE:AON) also said on Thursday they were halting operations in Russia.
Deutsche Bank said earlier this week its credit risk exposure to Russia and Ukraine was 2.9 billion euros ($3.18 billion) and that it had reduced its Russia exposure further over the past two weeks.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) have also disclosed billions of euros' worth of Russia risk.
""Most European banks are applying the strictest sanctions and even going further, trying to do what is right and what needs to be done,"" Ana Botin, president of the European Banking Federation and executive chairman of Santander (MC:SAN), said in an interview with Spain's El Mundo newspaper published on Friday. 
While the potential losses among major European lenders are not big enough to threaten their stability, analysts and investors fear it could derail their turnaround plans and halt payouts to shareholders.
European banking stocks have had a reprieve this week, however, clawing back some of their sharp losses made since the invasion.

1215,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 05:21AM ET</span>","Uniqlo operator, Japan Tobacco to suspend some Russia operations in U-turn","TOKYO (Reuters) -Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing Co and  Japan Tobacco  (OTC:JAPAF) Inc on Thursday said they would suspend some operations in Russia, in a U-turn by the Japanese consumer giants which had indicated they would stay in the market after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
The two companies were notable stand outs among major brands, saying they would continue doing business in Russia amid the imposition of massive trade and banking sanctions. 
Tadashi Yanai, the founder of Fast Retailing had told Japanese media that the company would continue operating its 50 stores in Russia because ""clothing is a necessity of life"".
But on Thursday Fast Retailing said: ""While continuing our Uniqlo business in Russia, it has become clear to us that we can no longer proceed due to a number of difficulties.
""We condemn all forms of aggression that violate human rights and threaten the peaceful existence of individuals.""
Japan Tobacco, which controls about one-third of Russia's tobacco market through brands including Winston and Camel, said its subsidiary there would suspend investment, marketing activities and a planned launch of a heated tobacco product.
""The challenges of operating in Russia at this time are unprecedented,"" the company said in a statement.
Japan Tobacco, which has four factories and about 4,000 workers in Russia, is continuing manufacturing there for now, but those activities could also be suspended depending on changes in the operating environment, the company said.
A wave of global consumer brands, such as  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE),  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI), and home furnishings firm IKEA, have said in recent days they would halt sales and investment in Russia. 
Fast Retailing was also among major clothing companies that faced a backlash last year over their operations in China amid criticisms of alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang province.
Fast Retailing insisted its sourcing in China was sustainable, and founder Yanai told the Nikkei newspaper the company wouldn't choose between the U.S. and Chinese markets.
The company has more than 800 stores in China, about the same as in its home market of Japan. Staying in Russia put the company at risk of boycotts in its bigger consumer bases, said LightStream Research analyst Oshadhi Kumarasiri.

""We could expect such an approach when it comes to China as the Chinese market is extremely important to the company,"" Kumarasiri, who publishes to the SmartKarma platform, told Reuters before the Russia pullout announcement. ""However, Russia is not so important as to risk a backlash from other main markets.""
Fast Retailing will also halt online sales in Russia, the company said. The company previously announced it would donate $10 million and 200,000 clothing items to aid refugees from the crisis.

By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) -  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) set new targets on Thursday to nearly halve its exposure to the financing of emissions from oil, gas and coal between 2020 and 2030.
Switzerland's second-biggest bank reduced its exposure to emissions it financed in the oil, gas and coal sector by 41% between 2020 and 2021, preliminary estimates in its sustainability report showed on Thursday, when it had some $2.6 billion in loans outstanding to such clients.
The report marks the first time the bank detailed its exposure to financing emissions from the fossil fuel sector, which it estimated at 21.9 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent for 2021.
Financed emissions are greenhouse gas emissions associated with a financial institutions' loans and investment.
Credit Suisse began adjusting its policies on coal following pressure from environmental groups in late 2019, and in 2020 halted lending to companies which make more than 25% of their revenue from thermal coal mining or coal power.
Those restrictions were stepped up further in late 2021, when it decided to exclude any new clients generating more than 5% of revenues from coal activities or seeking to develop new coal projects.
But investors and climate activists have repeatedly asked the bank to do more, with investors managing $2.4 trillion calling on Credit Suisse this week to take tougher climate action, including cutting its exposure to fossil fuel assets. 
The group, which includes Europe's biggest asset manager Amundi and a host of Swiss pension funds, said it plans to submit a resolution to Credit Suisse's annual general meeting on April 29.
In its sustainability reported--published as the bank detailed a 2021 pay cut for executives--Credit Suisse said it had reduced its potential exposure to coal mining companies by 39% to $640 million at end-2021, while reducing its potential lending exposure to oil and gas companies by 25% from 2020 to $9.8 billion.

The bank also said 2021 figures remained preliminary estimates, calculated using year-end lending exposure paired with client data on emissions and financials from the year before.
It expects to set further sector-specific goals by the end of 2022, it said.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 05:11AM ET</span>",Musk's plan for Tesla-built batteries has an acceleration challenge,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Elon Musk wants to make cheaper batteries - fast.
But the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc chief executive is unlikely to hit ambitious targets for Tesla to mass-produce its own new batteries this year, industry insiders and analysts say. Though Musk is known for doing the impossible, starting with turning the electric vehicle maker into the world's most valuable auto company, the challenges of launching a new factory and developing a new way of battery manufacturing, are likely to be too much. 
The stakes are high. Prices of battery ingredients like nickel hit records this week on supply fears stemming from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and Musk in January forecast battery supply constraints next year, making in-house production a key to growth. 
""He is changing the way how battery manufacturing is done,"" said Shirley Meng, a University of Chicago professor who previously worked with Maxwell, a battery technology company acquired by Tesla. ""It's really, really difficult to manufacture at a speed and at scale.""
""I think they will probably fall short of the ramp-up of 4680 over the next year,"" said Gene Munster, managing partner at venture capital firm Loup Ventures, referring to the next-generation EV battery. Munster sees Tesla beating its targets longer-term, but starting off slowly, given its history of new-model production.
Musk says making the batteries at scale will be very difficult, but they are critical to his goal of building less expensive, longer-range electric cars that will keep Tesla ahead of a growing pack of competitors.
Like other automakers, Tesla sources battery cells from suppliers like Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp, CATL and LG Energy Solution. In late 2020, Musk announced that Tesla aims to halve the costs of the most expensive part of an EV by producing its own batteries. 
Tesla's 4680 lithium-ion batteries - with 46-millimeter diameter and 80-millimeter length - hold about five times the energy of its current smaller 2170 cells. Tesla can use a smaller number of new cells for the same energy and driving range, reducing costs. 
Tesla has said it will start delivering Model Y vehicles with its bigger battery cells by the end of March. In 2020, Musk said Tesla would have capacity to produce 100 gigawatt hours of 4680 batteries this year, enough to power about 1.3 million cars, and more than enough to supply production at factories in Texas and Germany. 
Tesla is expected to deliver about 1.4 million vehicles this year. Industry researcher Benchmark Mineral Intelligence expects the company to produce batteries for about 30,000 Model Y vehicles, growing to 484,000 in 2024, according to a previously unpublished forecast provided to Reuters.
DOUBLE CHALLENGE
Tesla faces a lengthy process in ramping up a battery factory, complicated by plans to use a new manufacturing technology called dry electrode coating.
""There's a very long process of fine-tuning the equipment before you can get to volume production,"" said Caspar Rawles, chief data officer at Benchmark, adding that Tesla would have to refine the manufacturing process this year to ensure volume production in 2023. 
""Battery production is hard, even hard for experienced suppliers,"" Rawles said. 
Tesla said it produced its one millionth 4680 cell in January. It did not say how long it took to hit that milestone, but Benchmark estimated that 1 million cells would power only 1,200 Model Ys, which suggests that Tesla has a long way to go. 
Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its battery business. Senior Vice President Drew Baglino said in January Tesla is ""making meaningful progress of the ramp curve"" in its test battery factory in Fremont, California, while installing battery equipment at its upcoming plant in Texas. 
Baglino said Tesla's ""focus is to drive yield quality and cost to ensure we are ready for larger volumes this year as we ramp and next year."" 
As a sign of Tesla's ambition, it expects to beat established battery makers Panasonic and LG to market with 4680s.
The crowning difficulty for Tesla is that it is planning a new manufacturing process, called dry electrode, a technology it obtained via its 2019 acquisition of California startup Maxwell Technologies. The factory equipment, Musk said, ""doesn't exist. It's being made."" 
Dry electrode manufacturing skips a traditional, complicated step of battery manufacturing that involves a chemical slurry. If it works, it will be cheaper and more efficient, but Musk freely admits it will be a challenge. 
""The very difficult part is then scaling up that production and achieving extremely higher reliability and safety with the cells,"" he told a European battery conference in November 2020. 

Even so, his timeline is seen as optimistic. It took more than a decade for battery makers to optimize the conventional manufacturing process for lithium-ion batteries. 
Musk - who described a ""production hell"" of mass producing the Model 3 sedan several years ago - might experience a ""Death Valley"" start to scaling up the dry electrode process, said professor Meng, adding, though, that Tesla will overcome the difficulties.

Investing.com – Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) stock traded sideways in premarket Friday as traders were split between its strong fourth quarter outlook and earnings miss in the third.
The stock was down 0.7% initially but was just about in the green later.
Heavy spending to develop cloud capabilities and services had the company trail third quarter earnings estimates.
Cloud services and license support costs rose 23% during the quarter, while total operating expenses were up 8% at $6.69 billion.
Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said earnings were hit by ""share price declines of equity investments, impacted by the widespread downturn in equity markets last quarter.""
Catz was referring to Oracle’s investments in gene sequencing company Oxford Nanopore (LON:ONT) and ARM server chipmaker Ampere.
The company is targeting healthcare as a key focus area to embed its services in. In December, it also agreed to acquire health information technology vendor Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) for over $28 billion.
Late in embracing cloud, Oracle will incur a capital expenditure of $4 billion this year to take on the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Sales of Fusion and NetSuite – Oracle’s two enterprise resource planning products – rose 33% and 27% respectively – slower than in the previous quarter as the company attempts to transition more clients to cloud, and away from on-premise management.
Cloud revenue for the quarter ended February 28 rose 24% to $2.8 billion. The business had booked $2.7 billion in revenue in the second quarter.
Total revenue rose 4.2% to $10.5 billion and match analysts’ estimates. Adjusted profit per share fell 3 cents to $1.13.
The company expects current quarter adjusted profit to be $1.40-$1.44 per share, ahead of estimates. It forecast revenue to grow 6-8% on a constant currency basis."

STOCKHOLM/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Nokia (NYSE:NOK) is in talks to replace Huawei 4G radio equipment from parts of  Vodafone  (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea's telecom network in India, in one of the largest swap deals for the Finnish company, three sources familiar with the matter said.
The deal will see Nokia deploying 12,000 5G-ready radio sites and 4,000 small cells in Vodafone Idea's network in India's capital Delhi, the sources said.
Telecom operators in India have been reducing their dependence on Huawei after certain security concerns and Vodafone Idea's move is a blow to Huawei's prospects in the country, telecom experts said, adding more operators may choose to replace the Chinese company as supplier.
Huawei said the company doesn't comment on specific projects. Nokia declined to comment, while Vodafone Idea did not respond to requests for comment.
Several countries, including the United States, Britain and Sweden have blocked operators from using equipment made by Huawei over security concerns. Huawei denies it is a security risk.
""Unfortunately, there is no choice but to move out of Huawei because of the security concerns and government pressure,"" said Vivekanand Subbaraman, a telecom analyst at India's Ambit Capital. 
""Those concerns are not something you can wish away.""
Vodafone Idea in January agreed to convert dues owed to the government for use of airwaves into equity, giving the Indian state a 35.8% stake in the company. 
Vodafone Group (LON:VOD) holds 28.5% and Aditya Birla Group 17.8%.
Though India has not banned Huawei, the country has not named Chinese companies, including Huawei, among the list of approved suppliers for carrying out 5G trials. India is expected to auction 5G spectrum later this year.

In a swap deal, an operator changes an existing vendor and Nokia had earlier replaced Huawei gear in operators including BT, Orange Belgium, Proximus in Britain, Belgium and Luxembourg respectively.
Huawei supplies telecom equipment to both Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel and the former is one of its largest customers in India. Bharti Airtel also counts Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) among its suppliers. ""(The) India market is very complex with many challenges and we are closely monitoring the developments in this market,"" Huawei said. Huawei has a 29% share of the global telecom equipment market, followed by Nokia and Ericsson at 15% each, according to research firm Dell'Oro. Nokia's gear will allow Vodafone Idea to manage 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G networks from the same platform and deployment could start from next month, according to the sources.

Investing.com - European stock markets edged higher, rebounding after the previous session’s hefty losses with investors digesting strong U.K. growth, the hawkish ECB stance, and the continuing war in Ukraine.
By 3:55 AM ET (0855 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, the CAC 40 in France traded flat, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 outperformed, rising 0.7%.
Data released earlier Friday showed that Britain's economy rebounded much more than expected in January, with gross domestic product growing by 0.8% on the month after a 0.2% decline in December. 
The Bank of England meets next week, and these upbeat numbers can only bolster the chances of the central bank lifting interest rates for the third time in the space of three months.
European equities closed sharply lower Thursday after talks between the foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine failed to bring about a ceasefire to the conflict that has roiled markets over the last couple of weeks, with commodity prices, and oil, in particular, soaring to record levels.
Further moves to punish Russia are expected on Friday, with the United States, the European Union, and other allied nations set to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trading status. This would then allow for the imposition of tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods, further hurting the country’s economy.
The Institute of International Finance on Thursday cut its 2022 Russian GDP growth expectation, saying Moscow’s economy will contract by some 15% this year due to the severity of sanctions, having previously had a 3% growth estimate.
The European Central Bank surprised investors on Thursday by taking a relatively hawkish tone, announcing it would be speeding up its plans to tighten monetary policy, phasing out all of its asset purchases in the summer if inflation fails to come down fast enough.
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) stock rose 0.4% after Switzerland’s second-largest bank set new targets to nearly halve its exposure to the financing of emissions from oil, gas, and coal by the end of 2030.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) stock rose 0.5% after the German lender announced it paid 14% more in bonuses for 2021, rewarding staff for the bank's most profitable year in a decade.
Oil prices stabilized on Friday but still looked set for the largest weekly drop since November 2021, amid uncertainty over global production levels in a week marked by talk of potential supply additions, mainly from the United Arab Emirates, as well as additional sanctions on Russia. 
By 3.55 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.6% higher at $108.68 a barrel, heading for a weekly drop of around 8% after touching a high of $130.50, while the Brent contract rose 3.1% to $112.74, set for a weekly fall of about 7% after hitting a 14-year high of $139.13. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,999.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower at 1.0979."

Toshiba will hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on March 24 to put to a vote its plan to split in two, drawn up originally after a five-month strategic review.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open marginally higher Friday, rebounding after the previous session's sharp losses. At the same time, investors digest surging U.S. inflation, British growth data, and the continuing war in Ukraine.
At 2 AM ET (0700 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.1% higher, CAC 40 futures in France climbed 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.9%.
European equities closed sharply lower Thursday, with the DAX and the CAC 40 both dropping nearly 3%, after talks between the foreign ministers of both Russia and Ukraine, helped in Turkey, failed to bring about a ceasefire to the conflict between the two countries. 
Markets have been roiled over the last couple of weeks as Western nations levied a number of sanctions on Russia as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine, moves which have seen commodity prices, and oil, in particular, soaring to record levels.
Further action is expected on Friday after Reuters reported that the United States, the European Union, and other allied nations are set to revoke Russia's ""most favored nation"" trading status. This would then allow for the imposition of tariffs on a wide range of Russian goods, further hurting the country’s economy.
Data from the U.K. on Friday showed that the country’s economy grew by 0.8% in January, a stronger rebound than expected after contracting by 0.2% in December. 
Financial markets expect the Bank of England to raise rates from 0.5% to their pre-pandemic level of 0.75% next week amid rising price pressures, and this rebound will largely cement those expectations.
These inflationary pressures were in full display in the U.S. on Thursday, as consumer inflation jumped an annualized 7.9% in February, the largest increase in 40 years.
The Federal Reserve also meets next week and is widely expected to raise its Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points, especially in the wake of the hawkish tone from the European Central Bank, which said on Thursday it would stop bond-buying in the third quarter if inflation doesn't fall.
In corporate news,  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) could be in the spotlight Friday, after Switzerland’s second-largest bank set new targets on Thursday to nearly halve its exposure to the financing of emissions from oil, gas, and coal by the end of 2030.
Oil prices stabilized on Friday but still looked set for the largest weekly drop since November, amid uncertainty over global production levels in a week marked by talk of potential supply additions, mainly from the United Arab Emirates, as well as additional sanctions on Russia. 
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.2% higher at $107.33 a barrel, heading for a weekly drop of around 8% after touching a high of $130.50, while the Brent contract rose 1.4% to $110.94, set for a weekly fall of about 7% after hitting a 14-year high of $139.13. 
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,991.25/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% higher at 1.1004."
1227,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2022 01:55AM ET</span>",Factbox - Airline hedging and surcharges offset some oil price pain,"(Reuters) - The price of oil this week surged to its highest point since 2008 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding to airline costs at a time when carriers have been struggling to recover from a pandemic-related collapse in demand.
Oil prices were already strong because of tight global supplies, but Western sanctions on Russia, a major oil supplier, over its invasion of Ukraine, sent prices into overdrive. The northwest European jet fuel price in the spot market soared by 85% since Feb. 25 to $1,649 a tonne on Wednesday, though it fell back to $1,007 by Friday.
Malaysia Airlines said on Friday it would put in place a fuel surcharge for some markets from March 23 and manage capacity to mitigate unprofitable routes due to rising fuel costs.
Its budget rival AirAsia on March 5 introduced fuel surcharges on tickets for the first time since 2015. Chinese airlines, meanwhile, raised fuel surcharges on domestic routes and Emirates, Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings have also raised surcharges recently.
Some airlines have oil hedges that will help partially offset the price increase, but other carriers are fully unhedged, including U.S. majors United Airlines, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), though the latter does own an oil refinery. 
Many carriers are also being squeezed by the need to fly longer routes to avoid Russian and Ukrainian airspace.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) 
The airline has hedged 72% of oil consumption for the first quarter and 63% for the second quarter at $90 a barrel, with smaller amounts hedged in the second half, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 17. 
Air New Zealand
The airline has hedged 1.34 million barrels of oil in the six months to June 30 and 707,500 barrels in the following half-year period, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 24. In late February it raised international fares by about 5%, citing rising oil prices and general cost inflation. 
Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) 
The Hong Kong airline has hedged its entire first-quarter consumption and about half of its expected second-quarter consumption, it said on Wednesday. It has also hedged lower amounts through the end of 2023.
easyJet (LON:EZJ) 
The European airline 60% hedged for fuel in the financial year to Sept. 30 at about $504 per metric tonne, it said on Jan. 27.
IAG (LON:ICAG)
The British Airways owner is hedged against volatile crude prices for two years, Chief Executive Luis Gallego said on Feb. 25. It has covered about 60% for the whole of 2022.
Based on a fuel price scenario of $900 a tonne, the company would be paying $690 a tonne in the first quarter after hedging 70% of its fuel and foreign exchange, a Feb. 25 results presentation shows. In the second quarter the price would rise to $750 after hedging 65% of fuel and foreign exchange.
Lufthansa 
The German airline is 63% hedged in 2022 at a break-even price of $74 a barrel, it said in a results presentation on March 3.
Qantas Airways
The Australian airline has more than 90% of its fuel hedged for the six months to June 30, Chief Executive Alan Joyce said on Tuesday, adding it had also hedged 50% of its fuel for the following quarter.
Ryanair 
The budget carrier is 80% hedged on fuel out to 2023, but rising prices will still cost the group about 50 million euros ($54.2 million) over the next 12 months, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on March 2, adding that Ryanair would not introduce fuel charges for the summer.
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY)
The airline hedged 30% of its oil needs at an average Brent crude price of $57 a barrel for the six months to March 31, it said in a results presentation in November. It had also hedged 40% of its needs at an average price of $60 for the following five quarters. 
Wizz Air 
The European budget airline on Monday said it has covered its fuel costs for the next four months with zero-cost hedges. 

For March, it has covered half its needs with a price ceiling of $1,172 a tonne and 40% of its needs for the first quarter to end-June at $1,142 a tonne. Its financial year ends on March 31, 2023.

(Reuters) - California utility PG&E (NYSE:PCG) Corp is partnering with U.S. automaker Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co to bring 'bidirectional' charging electric vehicles (EV) to its customers, the utility's chief executive said on Thursday.
Under bidirectional charging, also known as 'vehicle-to-grid' charging, the electric charge can travel both ways, allowing the EV to charge a consumer's home or tools. 
""We're announcing today our partnership with  Ford Motor Co  to bring bidirectional charging vehicles, specifically the Ford F-150 Lightning, to the PG&E customers,"" Patti Poppe said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. ""Imagine if your home generator was your car.""
Poppe said a bidirectional vehicle can provide power to a home for three to five days.
The pilot programme will test how the Lightning electric pickup truck can interact with the grid to support electric reliability by providing backup power for customers' homes in the utility's service area, PG&E said.
Ford previously partnered with solar power company Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) Inc to use the Lightning, which Ford will begin building this spring, to power homes.

Ford CEO Jim Farley at the same event called the deal a next step, allowing the automaker's vehicles to plug into grids themselves. He added that Ford will probably make most of its EVs bidirectional.
Farley added he doesn't think EV leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc will take this approach with its vehicles because it has an energy business to protect.

(Reuters) - Meta Platforms will allow Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram users in some countries to call for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers in the context of the Ukraine invasion, according to internal emails seen by Reuters on Thursday, in a temporary change to its hate speech policy.
The social media company is also temporarily allowing some posts that call for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, according to internal emails to its content moderators.
""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as 'death to the Russian invaders.' We still won't allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians,"" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.
The calls for the leaders' deaths will be allowed unless they contain other targets or have two indicators of credibility, such as the location or method, one email said, in a recent change to the company's rules on violence and incitement.
Citing the Reuters story, Russia's embassy in the United States demanded that Washington stop the ""extremist activities"" of Meta.
""Users of Facebook & Instagram did not give the owners of these platforms the right to determine the criteria of truth and pit nations against each other,"" the embassy said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) in a message that was also shared by their India office.
The temporary policy changes on calls for violence to Russian soldiers apply to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine, according to one email.
In the email recently sent to moderators, Meta highlighted a change in its hate speech policy pertaining both to Russian soldiers and to Russians in the context of the invasion.
""We are issuing a spirit-of-the-policy allowance to allow T1 violent speech that would otherwise be removed under the Hate Speech policy when: (a) targeting Russian soldiers, EXCEPT prisoners of war, or (b) targeting Russians where it's clear that the context is the Russian invasion of Ukraine (e.g., content mentions the invasion, self-defense, etc.),"" it said in the email.
""We are doing this because we have observed that in this specific context, 'Russian soldiers' is being used as a proxy for the Russian military. The Hate Speech policy continues to prohibit attacks on Russians,"" the email stated.
Last week, Russia said it was banning Facebook in the country in response to what it said were restrictions of access to Russian media on the platform. Moscow has cracked down on tech companies, including Twitter, which said it is restricted in the country, during its invasion of Ukraine, which it calls a ""special operation.""
Many major social media platforms have announced new content restrictions around the conflict, including blocking Russian state media RT and Sputnik in the European Union, and have demonstrated carve-outs in some of their policies during the war.

Emails also showed that Meta would allow praise of the right-wing Azov battalion, which is normally prohibited, in a change first reported by The Intercept.
The Meta spokesperson previously said the company was ""for the time being, making a narrow exception for praise of the Azov Regiment strictly in the context of defending Ukraine, or in their role as part of the Ukraine National Guard.""

Florida lawmakers recently passed a Republican-backed bill prohibiting classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity for many young students. 
The legislation has stirred national controversy amid an increasingly partisan debate over what schools should teach children about race and gender. 
""As a proud member of the LGBTQ+ community, I am deeply concerned about laws being enacted across the country, particularly those focused on our vulnerable youth,"" Cook said on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Bob Chapek is another chief executive to voice his disappointment about the LGBTQ legislation.
Another case that has stirred corporate concern about LGBTQ rights is that of a Texas judge who recently issued an order blocking the state from investigating the parents of a 16-year-old transgender girl for providing her with gender-affirming medical treatments.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott says the treatments are ""child abuse"" and the state has appealed against the judge's order.

Major U.S. tech firms, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc and Apple are among more than 60 companies that have opposed equating gender-affirming treatment with child abuse by putting their names to an ad that will run in Texas on Friday, according to Axios.

Investing.com – Chinese tech shares fell on Friday, alongside their U.S. counterparts, as fresh regulatory concerns added to an already volatile market. These concerns stem from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s identification of five Chinese firms that could be subject to delisting if they failed to comply with certain auditing requirements.
The quintet is Beigene Ltd. (HK:6160),  Yum China Holdings  Inc. (HK:9987), Zai Lab Ltd. (HK:9688),  ACM Research Shanghai  Inc. (SS:688082)and Hutchmed China Ltd. (HK:0013) BeiGene’s Hong Kong shares were down 8.28% to HK$106.40 ($13.60) by 11:34 PM GMT (4:34 AM GMT). Yum China shares fell 12.15% to HK$335.40, while  Zai Lab  (NASDAQ:ZLAB) shares fell 13.24% to HK$253 and Hutchmed shares slid 14.97% to HK$24.70. ACM Research’s Chinese shares were down 9.16% to CNY$89.39 ($14.14).
In response to the SEC move, China Securities Regulatory Commission posted a note on its official WeChat page that said that together with the Ministry of Finance, it has continued to communicate with the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and has made “positive progress.”
Although some analysts predict that the risks of delisting are unlikely to materialize in the near term, even the probability unnerved a market already dealing with the Chinese government’s year-long crackdown and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
The SEC update is “a reminder for the regulatory risks surrounding Chinese equities once again and the lack of positive catalysts overnight may potentially aggravate the downside move,” IG Asia Pte Ltd. market strategist Jun Rong Yeap told Bloomberg.
The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index that tracks Chinese shares listed in the U.S. tumbled 10% overnight, its biggest slide since October 2008. The index has slumped more than 60% since a February 2021 peak.
Meanwhile, China’s regulatory tightening for private enterprises has also seemingly intensified in recent weeks, even after food delivery platforms were asked to cut fees charged to restaurants. Authorities have also issued warnings about the risks in investing in products linked to the metaverse."

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Friday morning, with Chinese stocks in the U.S. plummeting to around 14-year lows. Investors also digested data showing the highest U.S. inflation in 40 years, which drove U.S. bond yields higher and raised expectations that interest rate hikes will be steeper.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 2.28% by 9:55 PM ET (2:55 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that household spending grew 6.9% month-on-month, but contracted 1.2% year-on-year, in January 2022. The Business Sentiment Index (BSI) Large Manufacturing Conditions index for the first quarter was -7.6.
South Korea’s KOSPI was down 1.04%.
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.83%, with Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe speaking earlier in the day. Across the Tasman Sea, New Zealand’s Business NZ purchasing managers' index was 53.6 in February.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 3.23%.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1.59% and the ShenzhenComponent was down 1.51%. Chinese stocks trading in the U.S. tumbled, with the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index plunging 10% on Thursday, its biggest drop since October 2008. This selloff came after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission identified five Chinese companies that could be subject to delisting if they fail to comply with certain auditing requirements.
Data released on Thursday showed that the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) grew 7.9% year-on-year and 0.8% month-on-month in February. The core CPI grew 0.5% month-on-month and 6.4% year-on-year.
The data, while within expectations, added to concerns about the economic recovery from the recent rally in commodity markets. This could lead to more hawkish action from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is already expected to hike interest rates when it hands down its policy decision on Mar. 16.
“The biggest risk is inflation,” City Index senior market analyst Fiona Cincotta told Reuters. “Even though central banks will try and rush to get through as much tightening as possible in the first half of the year, I think looking further out, they’re going to struggle if growth really starts to take a hit.”
The European Central Bank kept its interest rate steady at 0% as it handed down its own policy decision on Thursday. However, it accelerated its wind-down of monetary stimulus in a surprise move, signaling that the central bank’s focus is on high inflation rather than weaker economic growth.
The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield steadied after climbing above 2%, and the 30-year rate hit its highest level since May 2021. Inflationary pressure is adding to the strain on global markets, with little hope of progress in talks between Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict triggered by Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was the latest addition to the list of firms pulling out of Russia over the invasion."

FDA said in a statement that it had determined the order necessary, citing the risk of harm posed by the recalled products. 
""Taking this action today enables the FDA to mandate that Philips Respironics improve its communication about the recall and the serious risk posed by the foam used in the recalled products with patients,"" the regulator added. 
The company said in a statement it would be working with its durable medical equipment (DME) customers to allow the company to directly contact those patients and other end-users that may not yet have received notice of the recall.

Philips Respironics had recalled some breathing devices and ventilators in June last year because of a foam part that might degrade and become toxic, potentially causing cancer.
The health regulator has also recommended the company to provide monthly updates to device users that include information on expected time for replacement and current rate of replacement of recalled devices.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global share markets slid on Thursday as U.S. inflation hit almost 8%, making it almost certain the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next week, and the European Central Bank sped up the end of its massive stimulus program.
Data showed U.S. consumer inflation running at a 7.9% annualized clip in February, the largest annual increase in 40 years. 
Wall Street fell on the data because, while markets expect the central bank to raise the Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of next week's monetary policy meeting, the CPI data suggested the FOMC could move ""more aggressively"" to curb inflation, as promised by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week.
The ECB earlier in the session said it will stop pumping money into financial markets this summer, paving the way for an increase in interest rates as soaring inflation outweighs concerns about the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Talks between Ukraine and Russia on Thursday failed to bring any respite in the conflict, which has trapped hundreds of thousands of civilians in Ukrainian cities sheltering amid Russian air raids and shelling.
The euro retreated from overnight gains following the ECB announcement, and the dollar strengthened on the U.S. inflation report. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2% for the first time in two weeks.
Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, said that some inflation can be beneficial to stock prices, but central banks have their work cut out for them managing inflation that is at multi-decade highs. 
""We've reached that tipping point between good inflation and bad inflation. It is driving volatility higher, and the higher volatility typically drives away investors,"" Brown said.
""Sentiment is very uncertain. Now that we are where we are, can (central bankers) tread that fine line between managing inflation and not pushing us into recession?""

Veneta Dimitrova, senior U.S. economist at Ned Davis Research, said that with the sharp rises in energy and other commodity markets due to the war in Ukraine, it will most likely take longer to reach peak inflation. 
""This means higher inflation for longer and a treacherous policy path for the Fed ahead,"" Dimitrova, adding she expects the Fed to proceed with a 25-basis point interest rate increase next week. 
""With all the geopolitical uncertainty and market volatility out there, the Fed doesn’t want to add to the uncertainty.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street resumed its slide on Thursday, ending in the red as inflation hit a four-decade high, cementing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would hike key interest rates at the conclusion of next week's monetary policy meeting to prevent the economy from overheating.
Looming uncertainties surrounding Russia's invasion of Ukraine also helped convince market participants to recommence their flight to safety.
While all three major indexes ended in the red, they pared their losses late in the day and closed well above session lows, as the U.S. equities market followed its best day in months on Wednesday by renewing a multi-session sell-off.
""It's more of the same,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, noting that the equity market's daily volatility is ""being driven more by geopolitical than economic news."" 
Consumer prices surged in February to a 7.9% annual growth rate, according to the Labor Department, the hottest reading in forty years.
""The (CPI) print was not far off estimates,"" Nolte added. ""There will be more to come in the next month or two as some of the rising commodity prices get incorporated."" 
While the market fully expects the central bank to raise the Fed funds target rate by 25 basis points at the conclusion of next week's monetary policy meeting, the CPI data suggested the FOMC could move ""more aggressively"" to curb inflation in the upcoming year, as promised by Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week.
""It's still expected the Fed will raise rates four to seven times in the next year or two to curb economic growth,"" Nolte said, adding that ""what complicates this, is the Fed has never raised rates with the yield curve this flat and volatility so high.""
""They're trying to increase rates at a time when the market is in turmoil.""
The graphic below shows annual core CPI growth, along with other indicators, and how far they have soared above the Fed's average annual inflation target:
Energy prices were the main culprit, with gasoline prices surging 6.6% in a single month, although the report did not reflect the entirety of spiking crude prices in the wake of Russia's actions in Ukraine.
Those actions kept geopolitical jitters at a full boil, with peace talks showing little progress even as a humanitarian crisis unfolds and world oil supply pressures continued to weigh on global markets.

1237,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 07:10PM ET</span>","Opposition to Toshiba break-up grows as top shareholder, proxy firms speak out","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - The top shareholder in Toshiba (OTC:TOSYY) Corp and two influential proxy advisory firms joined a growing list of investors on Thursday who oppose the Japanese firm's plan to split up and dismantle the 146-year-old conglomerate. 
It marks the latest in a long battle between the once-mighty tech company and a number of its foreign shareholders as it tries to revive itself following years of accounting scandals and governance issues. 
Toshiba will hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on March 24 to put its plan to split in two, drawn up originally after a five-month strategic review, to a vote. 
Effissimo Capital Management, which owns a stake of about 10% in Toshiba, said in a statement it has decided to vote against the plan, which has been criticised by some other hedge fund shareholders that favour a sale to a private equity firm.
The Singapore-based fund called on Toshiba to establish a trustworthy leadership team first, saying the current management and board are not capable of crafting ""a strategic plan with such irreversible and profound consequences.""
The plan, ""may ultimately damage Toshiba's medium- to long-term corporate value,"" it said.
Separately, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) advised against the break-up plan in a report dated Thursday.
""Years of corporate governance turmoil ... a split shareholder base, and an uninspiring management track record raise significant scepticism as to whether the current plan is superior to a privatisation proposal,"" ISS said.
ISS also recommended shareholders vote against a proposal from the second-largest shareholder, Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners, that Toshiba explore other options and solicit buyout offers from private equity firms.
The proposal to direct the board towards more explicitly considering a sale of the company ""appears overly prescriptive and premature given the three months remaining until the company's annual shareholders meeting,"" it said.
Glass Lewis, another influential proxy advisory firm, issued a report later on Thursday recommending against the management-backed break-up and advising acceptance of 3D's proposal to restart the strategic review.
Toshiba's core review of available alternatives was ""overtly narrow"" and not transparent enough to convince investors that the break-up plan was the most compelling path forward, Glass Lewis said. The review also sidestepped urgent investor feedback and widely reported interest from private equity firms, it said. 

Toshiba said in response to the Effissimo statement and the ISS recommendation that it would continue to make every effort to explain its proposal to shareholders to gain their support. It had no immediate comment on Glass Lewis. 
Toshiba earlier this month appointed an interim chief executive after shareholders voiced concerns that management had not appeared able to proceed with the company's restructuring plan in a timely manner.

(Reuters) -  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) forecast fourth-quarter profit above Wall Street estimates as the legacy software firm expects its heavy cloud investments to pay off, as more businesses ramp up their spending to support hybrid work and transition to cloud.
The company's strong forecast, which was disclosed on a call with analysts, pulled up its shares from a nearly 6% slide in extended trading triggered by tepid third-quarter profit due to higher spending for its cloud services.
Oracle said it is on track to spend $4 billion in capital expenditure this year as it looks to build more data centers and improve its cloud services that trail behemoths like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google.
Edward Jones analyst Logan Purk said Oracle's plan to increase investment in its cloud business was the ""right move."" ""I do think that's (profit forecast) enough to convince investors Oracle still has room to grow,"" he said.
Oracle said its third-quarter operating expenses were up as the company invested aggressively to meet customer demand for cloud services. Cloud services and license support costs alone rose 23% during the quarter, while total operating expenses were up 8% at $6.69 billion.
Excluding items, it earned $1.13 per share for the quarter ended Feb. 28, missing analysts' estimates of $1.18.
Oracle Chief Executive Officer Safra Catz said earnings were hit by ""share price declines of equity investments, impacted by the widespread downturn in equity markets last quarter.""

Revenue was at $10.51 billion, in line with estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The company expects fourth-quarter adjusted profit to be between $1.40 and $1.44 per share, ahead of estimates of $1.38. It forecast revenue to grow between 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 06:06PM ET</span>",Rivian shares tumble as supply-chain woes cut production outlook in half,"By Akash Sriram and Paul Lienert
(Reuters) - Rivian Automotive Inc warned on Thursday that supply-chain issues could cut its planned production in half in 2022 to 25,000 vehicles, sending shares of the EV maker down more than 12% in extended trading.
Rivian said as of March 8, it had built 1,410 vehicles this year, and 2,425 since the start of production. It said that during the two weeks prior to March 8 it averaged a weekly production rate that was about twice the exit rate of the fourth quarter of 2021, but it expects supply-chain constraints to continue through 2022.
""As we continue to ramp up our manufacturing facility, manage supply chain challenges, face continued inflationary pressures and minimize price increases to customers in the near term, we expect to recognize negative gross margins throughout 2022,"" the company said in a letter to shareholders.
""The 2022 production guidance was disappointing and well short of what they said in their road show, and the fourth-quarter loss was wider than expected,"" said Garrett Nelson, analyst at CFRA Research.
Rivian, other startups and legacy automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) face tough competition from market leader Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc as they aim to start delivering more electric vehicles in the near future.
Rivian reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.46 billion, or $4.83 per share, compared with a year-ago loss of $353 million, or $3.50 per share. It posted revenue of $54 million, well below investors' expectations of $60 million.
Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe said in a Thursday conference call with analysts that Rivian expects a ""significant"" production ramp-up in the second quarter of the EDV-700 van for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Rivian said it was ""exploring ways to further expand"" its commercial relationship with Amazon, which owns a 20% stake in the startup and has ordered 100,000 vans. Rivian said it will begin producing a second Amazon van this year, the EDV-500, which is shorter and narrower than the EDV-700.
Rivian said it had 83,000 pre-orders for its R1T pickup and R1S utility vehicle as of March 8, up from 71,000 in mid-December.

As of Thursday's market close, Rivian's share price had dropped about 77% and lost $124.5 billion in market capitalization since hitting its peak after going public in November.
The company ended the quarter with $18.4 billion in cash and equivalents.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 05:50PM ET</span>","U.S. to extend airplane, transit mask mandate through April 18","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration will extend requirements for travelers to wear masks on airplanes, trains and in transit hubs through April 18 as public health authorities review when mask requirements should be dropped, the White House confirmed.
The move extends the current requirements that were set to expire March 18 by a month.
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in statements Thursday that CDC will work with other government agencies ""to help inform a revised policy framework for when, and under what circumstances, masks should be required in the public transportation corridor.""
The TSA extension comes at the CDC's recommendation. Airline and some government officials think this could be the last nationwide extension of the mask requirements.
Airlines and travel groups last month called on the administration by March 18 to ""repeal the Federal mask mandate for public transportation or provide a clear roadmap to remove the mask mandate within 90 days.""
The mask requirements have resulted in significant friction on U.S. airplanes. The Federal Aviation Administration says since January 2021, there have been a record 6,800 unruly passenger incidents reported -- and 70% involved masking rules.
The CDC last month eased its guidance for wearing masks. U.S. government agencies have dropped mask requirements in federal buildings in the Washington area and other places with low or medium levels of COVID-19.
The CDC said last week that 93% of the U.S. population is in a location where COVID levels are low enough that people do not need to wear masks.
United Airlines said Thursday it would allow 2,200 unvaccinated workers to return to their normal positions as the pandemic recedes. 
The administration is also considering lifting requirements that international visitors get a negative COVID-19 test within a day of travel, officials said, as many countries have dropped testing requirements. The administration requires foreign air travelers to be vaccinated. 
On Thursday, 31 Republican senators asked the administration to end the mask and pre-departure testing requirements. ""It is time for the federal government to recognize this reality, follow the science, and reduce or eliminate these restrictions immediately,"" Senator Roger Wicker said.
The current CDC transit order, which has been in place since soon after Biden took office in January 2021, has been previously extended three times and requires masks to be worn by all travelers on airplanes, ships, trains, subways, buses, taxis and ride-shares and at transportation hubs such as airports, bus or ferry terminals, train and subway stations, and seaports.
His predecessor, President Donald Trump, rejected requests from U.S. public health agencies to impose the requirements in transit - even though airlines and some other transportation modes had required masks.

Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the Biden administration over the transportation mask mandate. 
""Seat-belt laws likewise took away the 'liberty' to choose driving (or flying) without a seat belt, but losing that choice was not irreparable harm,"" the Justice Department said in response, adding the court should reject Paxton's lawsuit.

(Reuters) - Aircraft lessor BOC Aviation Ltd believes a deadline giving lessors just over two weeks left to end contracts with Russian carriers due to sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine is ""unrealistic"", a senior executive said on Thursday.
""The EU and UK sanctions set, effectively, a deadline of 28 March for termination of aircraft leases, which is frankly an unrealistic timetable for a fleet of approximately 500 aircraft leased into Russia by operating lessors,"" Chief Operating Officer David Walton told analysts, according to an earnings call transcript.
However, he added BOC Aviation would comply with the sanctions and was discussing logistics for the recovery of its planes with customers. 
Russia published a draft law on Thursday that could prevent its airlines returning leased aircraft, raising the stakes in a showdown with Western finance over $10 billion of jets.
BOC Aviation said its 18 planes leased to Russian airlines had a book value of $935 million and could also be affected by insurance policy cancellations after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The international aviation insurance markets are progressively cancelling certain elements of insurance policies in relation to aircraft located in Russia or leased to Russian airlines,"" the lessor said in its financial results. ""This is a complex and rapidly developing situation that we are monitoring closely."" 
BOC Aviation, which has 4.8% of its assets by book value leased to Russian airlines, is among the first leasing firms to publicly confirm upheaval in the aviation insurance market. 

The resulting flood of claims and potential writedowns could trigger a lengthy contest between lessors and insurers over liability, according to experts.
BOC Aviation Chief Executive Robert Martin said Russian rental payments had been fully up to date as of the end of February. Russia's domestic aviation market was one of the strongest performers globally during the pandemic.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Six South American nations are proposing the exclusion of fertilizer from sanctions on Russia, a major world producer whose invasion of Ukraine has disrupted supplies, Brazil's Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias said on Thursday.
She said Brazil has secured the support of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay for a proposal excluding fertilizer products that will be submitted to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization.
Brazil, an agricultural powerhouse, is the world's top importer of fertilizers and argues that crop nutrients, like food, should not be targeted by sanctions.
Brazil relies on imports for 85% of the fertilizer it needs for its grain crops. More than one-fifth of its imports, totaling 9 million tonnes in 2021, comes from Russia.
Dias, who is expected to talk to FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu, has called on countries to find a global solution for the issue, noting a shortage of fertilizers will cause food inflation and potentially undermine food security. 
She hopes to get enough support from FAO to persuade other U.N. members to back the proposal.
""Global food inflation is something that should worry all countries,"" Dias said in a recent interview.
Even before the war in Ukraine, the global supply of fertilizers, especially potash, was already being curtailed after the United States sanctioned Belarus, another major producer.
As part of Brazil's efforts to secure supplies, Dias and Brazilian company representatives will travel next week to Canada, where  Nutrien  (NYSE:NTR), the world's largest global producer of potash, is based.

While Russia is Brazil's main supplier of the NPK fertilizer mixture of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, Canada is Brazil's main source of potash used to raise crop yields.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro visited Moscow days before the invasion of Ukraine to discuss Russian fertilizer supplies and sales of Brazilian beef.

(Reuters) - In the scramble by some bankers and financial industry executives to leave Moscow, Dubai is turning out to be a favorite location to land. 
Some bankers at Moscow offices of financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), Rothschild & Co and  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) have either left or are considering moving, as operating in Russia becomes increasingly difficult, several sources familiar with the matter said.
Goldman Sachs on Thursday became the first major Wall Street bank to say it was exiting the country following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, followed swiftly by JPMorgan Chase while  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said on Wednesday it was limiting operations.[nL3N2VD29I]
Employees in Russia worry that they could get caught in the middle of rising tensions between Moscow and the West, sources said. 
It was unclear exactly how many bankers have left Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24 and how long they might stay abroad. 
Around half of Goldman Sachs employees in Moscow have moved or are in the process of moving to Dubai, sources familiar with the matter said. The bank had around 80 staff in Moscow.
Bloomberg previously reported some Goldman bankers were moving to Dubai. 
A handful of JPMorgan bankers from Moscow are in Dubai, but the bank did not have a formal relocation program, a source familiar with the matter said. JPMorgan has about 160 staff in Moscow. 
One Dubai-based banker at a separate international bank said the firm had relocated about four people from Moscow to Dubai, and a few more were coming in the next few days.
Separately, two sources familiar with the situation said Rothschild is considering moving bankers from Russia, and one of the options being considered was Dubai. Rothschild declined comment. 
While Dubai has emerged as a favored destination for many of these people, the sources said, one of the sources said other destinations for departing bankers included Turkey.
""There's no particular playbook,"" said one of the sources, a Moscow-based financial industry professional now in Dubai, when asked how long people were planning on staying. 
Gulf Arab states have so far taken a neutral stance on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They have deep ties with Russia through stakes in companies and the oil cartel OPEC+.
Part of the draw of Dubai is logistics. While a number of countries closed their airspace to Russian planes after the Ukraine invasion, flights have been operating between Moscow and Dubai, a major financial center about five hours away with a time-zone difference of just one hour. 

In a sign of demand, the cheapest one-way airfare from Moscow to Dubai on Emirates jumped as much as 30 fold to $2,369 for departures between Wednesday and Friday, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Flights data showed.

(Reuters) - TikTok is nearing a deal for  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) to store its U.S. users' information without its Chinese parent ByteDance having access to it, hoping to address U.S. regulatory concerns over data integrity on the popular short video app, people familiar with the matter said.
The agreement would come a year and a half after a U.S. national security panel ordered ByteDance to divest TikTok because of fears that U.S. user data could be passed on to China's communist government.
That order was not enforced after Joe Biden succeeded Donald Trump as U.S. president last year. The panel, however, known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), has continued to harbor concerns over data security at TikTok that ByteDance is now hoping to address, the sources said. 
It is not clear whether CFIUS will find that TikTok's partnership with Oracle will resolve the national security issues it has identified, the sources said. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Oracle had discussed acquiring a minority stake in TikTok in 2020, when ByteDance was under U.S. pressure to sell the app. The cloud computing giant will store all of TikTok's U.S. user data on Oracle data servers under the new proposed partnership, the sources said. Some of TikTok's data is currently stored on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud.
A dedicated U.S. data management team of hundreds of people acting as a gatekeeper for U.S. user information and ringfencing it from ByteDance will be set up under the agreement, the sources said. The team will be comprised of engineers and cyber security personnel. The companies are discussing a structure under which that team would operate autonomously and not be under TikTok's control or supervision, the sources added.
TikTok is also exploring partnerships with other technology companies over firewalls and cyber security measures, the sources added. 
A TikTok spokesperson declined to comment on the partnership with Oracle. ""We continue to invest in data security as part of our overall work to keep our users and their information safe,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email.
Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
TikTok is one of the world's most popular social media apps, with more than 1 billion active users globally. The information of U.S. users is currently stored in TikTok data centers in Virginia, with a backup in Singapore.
The United States has been increasingly scrutinizing app developers over the personal data they handle, especially if some of it involves U.S. military or intelligence personnel.
Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd was forced to sell its popular gay dating app Grindr in 2020 after CFIUS approached it with national security concerns.

ByteDance is one of China's fastest growing startups. It owns the country's leading news aggregator, Jinri Toutiao, as well as TikTok's Chinese counterpart Douyin.
The U.S. Commerce Department is considering new rules to address potential security risks from TikTok and other foreign-owned apps, and potentially even ban some of them. The rules, if adopted, could force TikTok to submit to third-party auditing, source code examination and monitoring of user data logs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for a hit to U.S. earnings as oil and other commodity costs skyrocket and major U.S. companies including McDonald's begin to halt sales in Russia following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Estimates of the earnings growth for S&P 500 companies have barely budged since the invasion began two weeks ago, but strategists expect that to change as more companies give guidance on earnings for this year. 
The surge in commodity prices remains the biggest risk to profit growth, they said, since overall S&P 500 companies' revenue exposure to Russia is relatively small. 
Prices ""spiked on the Russia-Ukraine turmoil, but they'd been going up pretty fast anyway,"" said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.
That means forecasts are likely to ""come down across the board for everything but energy."" Also, he said, ""you're seeing a lot of companies back away from Russia.""
In addition to McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), companies including PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) stopped sales of their best-known products in Russia on Tuesday. McDonald's on Wednesday said the temporary closure of its 847 stores in Russia will cost the fast-food chain about $50 million a month. A list of companies that have cut Russia operations and trade can be found here:
One-time costs related to the closures ""could be significant on cash flow"" for some companies, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices in New York.
PRICING IN PROFIT CONCERNS
The recent sharp selloff in stock prices suggests investors already are pricing in an earnings impact, strategists said. The S&P 500 is down about 12% from its Jan. 3 record closing high and the Nasdaq Composite Index earlier this week finished down more than 20% from its November record closing high, confirming it is in a bear market.
The forward price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 is now at about 19, down from more than 22 at the start of the year.
Oil prices this week hit a 14-year high at over $139 a barrel, with the United States and other countries imposing a raft of sanctions aimed at stopping energy exports from Russia, the world's second-largest oil exporter.
While higher oil prices benefit energy companies, they are a negative for consumers and businesses alike and are likely to affect a wide range of companies.
The S&P 500 energy sector is up 38% so far in 2022, but it accounts for only about 4% of the S&P 500. Technology accounts for the most, at 27%.
Some strategists have estimated that benefits to energy firms from higher oil prices typically outweigh the drag on earnings of airlines and other companies potentially hurt by higher crude costs, but surging prices for gasoline and other commodities are hitting consumers hard. 
A broad rise in consumer prices reported by the Labor Department on Thursday led to the largest annual increase in inflation in 40 years, and inflation is set to accelerate further in the months ahead amid Russia's war against Ukraine.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.” 
Investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this month to try to combat inflation, which would leave the economic and profit growth outlook more uncertain. 
The Russia-Ukraine crisis also comes just as many businesses and consumers had begun to operate more normally after two years of living with the coronavirus pandemic. But U.S. profit growth for 2022 already was slated to be much lower than in 2021 when companies experienced a massive bounceback from the pandemic lows. 

U.S. companies next month are expected to begin reporting results on the first quarter. Analysts expect first-quarter S&P 500 earnings to increase 6.2% from a year ago, while they expect second-quarter earnings to grow 5.7%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. S&P 500 profit growth for all of 2022 is estimated at just 8% compared with 52% growth in 2021. 
For the second quarter, ""it's going to come really close to no growth,"" said Nick Raich, CEO of independent research firm the Earnings Scout. ""And third- and fourth-quarter numbers are going to have to come down, too.""

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 cut losses to end the day above session lows Thursday, amid signs of dip-buying activity after hopes of a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict were dashed as both sides failed to find a breakthrough in talks on a ceasefire. 
The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, but had been more than 1% lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3%, or 112 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1%.
Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said there was “no progress” on discussions concerning a ceasefire, and said that demands from his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov would amount to a surrender for Ukraine, something the country isn't prepared to do. 
""Russia is not in a position at this point to establish a cease-fire. They seek a surrender from Ukraine. This is not what they're going to get,"" Kuleba said following a sit down with Russia’s Lavrov.
Many had hoped that Ukraine’s softer stance on seeking to join the NATO military alliance – in the days leading up to the meeting – would pave the path toward a diplomatic resolution.
The lack of a breakthrough renewed fears that prices for key commodities including oil, gas, wheat and corn -- key exports from Russia and Ukraine -- will remain elevated, and keep inflation higher for longer.
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the IMF expects to cut its global growth estimate next month owing to the economic set back sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The consumer price index rose 0.8% in February, pushing inflation for the year through February to 7.9%, the hottest annual increase since January 1982.
“The risk is that the inflation we are enduring now could become more entrenched, as it did in the 1970s. That is why the Fed is so wedded to raising rates starting in March,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Technology fell nearly 3% as investors fled big tech, though Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) bucked the trend after announcing a $10 billion share buyback program and a 20-for-1 stock split.
Falling semiconductor stocks also weighed on the tech sector on concerns that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict will exacerbate supply problems for chip companies.
Financials pared their gains from a day earlier as banks were pressured by ongoing flattening in the yield curve in the wake of growing worries that red-hot inflation and slowing economic growth increase the risk of a recession.
U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) were sharply lower, with the latter down more than 4% as it announced Thomas P. Gibbons would be retiring as chief executive on Aug. 31.
“The headwinds for banks is clearly the Russia exposure, but it's also the flattening in the yield curve,” Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, an index and analytics provider, said in an interview with Investing.com on Thursday. “Higher rates are fine for banks as long as short term rates are lower, but if that's not the case, that's going to hurt banks.”
Energy stocks was one of the few sectors in the green even as oil prices erased their intraday gains.
The earnings front served up mostly positive results, with Crowdstrike garnering the bulk of investor attention.
Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) rolled out an upbeat outlook for the full-year after reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 12% higher.
Asana (NYSE:ASAN) also reported better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance that surprised to the upside, but the outlook for increased growth will likely prove costly as the company ramps up investment. Its shares fell more than 22%.
“The product/sales expansion is coming at the expense of aggressive investment, which we expect investors to look at cautiously given the challenging macro/geopolitical environment,” Oppenheimer said as it cut price target on the stock to $85 from $100 amid valuation concerns."

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) became the first U.S. banks to wind down business in Russia after it invaded Ukraine, while  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said it had gross exposure to Russia of 1.6 billion Swiss francs ($1.73 billion) at the end of last year. 
Goldman Sachs, which has a credit exposure to Russia of $650 million, said on Thursday it was winding down its business there, in a move that will likely increase pressure on rival lenders to follow. Any losses would be ""immaterial,"" according to a source familiar with the situation.
Just hours later, JPMorgan said it was ""actively unwinding Russian business"" and was not pursuing any new business there.
The largest U.S. bank said its operations in Russia are currently limited to helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations and manage their Russian-related risk, as well acting as a custodian for client assets.
JPMorgan has about 160 staff in Moscow. The bank did not list Russia in the top 20 countries where it has the most exposure in its most recent filings.
Western companies have pulled out of Russia en masse as the United States, European Union and Britain imposed sanctions aimed at cutting off Moscow's access to the global financial system in response to its Ukraine invasion.
Banks, insurers and asset managers, which rarely make political statements, have scrambled to distance themselves from Russia and assess their exposures, as the conflict enters its third week.
Credit Suisse was the latest European bank to reveal the size of potential losses, which it said included lending to wealthy clients as well as trade finance and investment banking exposure.
Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) have also disclosed billions of euros worth of Russia risk. In an extreme scenario, banks could lose it all if Moscow seizes assets and sanctions render Russia-related securities worthless. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said its credit-risk exposure to Russia and Ukraine was 2.9 billion euros and that it had reduced its Russia exposure further over the past two weeks.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
While the potential losses among major European lenders are not big enough to threaten their stability, analysts and investors fear it could derail their turnaround plans and halt payouts to shareholders.
The conflict has also potentially upended planned interest rate increases by the European Central Bank, with its policymakers expected to go into a meeting on Thursday divided as to how to proceed and wary of making mistakes.
BNP Paribas, meanwhile, has cut off its Russia-based workforce from its internal computer systems as it seeks to bolster its defences against any potential cyber attack, in another sign of how the conflict is hitting Western financial institutions.

The French bank, thought to be the first major lender to have shut staff in Moscow out of its IT networks, has also placed employees in other locations on high alert for cyber threats emanating from Russia.

Investing.com – Stocks waffled on Thursday led by a drop in technology shares after a surge in consumer prices for February showed inflation is running the hottest in 40 years.
Consumer prices rose 7.9% in February over last year, according to the Labor Department. The Federal Reserve meets next week and is widely expected – mostly because the central bank has telegraphed it so – to begin a series of interest rate hikes to calm inflation.
The big wild card of course is Russia's war against Ukraine, which broke out at the end of February and hasn’t been factored into the economic data so far. The war has driven up the costs of oil and other commodities.
Food prices jumped 1.0%, with the cost of food consumed at home soaring 1.4%, Reuters reported. Prices for fruit and vegetables increased by the most since March 2010, the report said, while prices for dairy and related products rose in nearly 11 years.
Gasoline prices in the U.S. are averaging a record $4.318 a gallon, up from $3.469 a month ago, AAA said.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) became the first Wall Street bank to quit operations in Russia, following a bunch of other American companies including McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) and  Coca-Cola Co  (NYSE:KO). 
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Peloton rentals
 Peloton Interactive Inc  (NASDAQ:PTON) is testing new pricing plans in which customers pay a monthly fee that covers both its stationary exercise bike and a monthly subscription to workout courses. If a customer cancels, Peloton will take back the bike.
Stores in Texas and Florida will begin bundling $60-$100 monthly subscriptions on Friday. The move comes as the new CEO tries to execute a turnaround after Peloton came under pressure from an activist shareholder to sell the company.
2. Netflix plans
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) won’t start an ad-supported subscription tier despite plans by rival Disney+ to do so, the streaming giant’s CFO said at a conference. 
Netflix is raising prices in the U.K. and Ireland for the second time in less than 18 months. The company is set to raise the price of its most popular subscription plan, which allows customers to watch on two screens at once, to £10.99 per month in the U.K. Netflix's premium plan will rise to £15.99 per month while the entry-level plan will move to £6.99.
3. Rising prices
Consumer prices rose 7.9% year over year last month, and Americans are paying more for fuel, food and rent. Inflation is poised to accelerate this month after the effect of Russia’s war on Ukraine on oil and gasoline prices work their way into the data.

Chile's SMA environmental watchdog had filed charges against the world's largest copper mine in mid-2020, saying it had been exceeding the maximum level allowed for water extraction since 2005, going over the 2019 limit threefold.
""After processing the penalty procedure, the SMA endorsed the charge made against the mining company, showing that the owner caused irreparable environmental damage in Las Vegas de Tilopozo,"" the regulator said in a statement.
BHP denied non-compliance with its environmental permit and said it is evaluating further action.
""Escondida reiterates that at no time did it exceed what was approved by the RCA in the Las Vegas de Tilopozo area, as has been reported to the authority every six months since 2001,"" the company said in a statement.

BHP added that it ceased the extraction of water from high Andean aquifers in 2019 and currently operates only with desalinated water.
Water use has been a big point of tension with regulators for copper and lithium miners in the Andean country, including lithium companies  Albemarle  (NYSE:ALB) and SQM.

Analysts polled by Refinitiv estimated 2023 revenue of $10.95 billion, which indicates a growth of 5.5%.
EBay saw strong demand from the online shopping boom last year during the COVID-19 pandemic, but is now scrambling to sustain the momentum as people return to regular living.
Moreover, analysts have said that eBay, which is still in the early stages of product innovation, faces tough competition from rivals such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
EBay said the digital wallet would let customers use proceeds from their sales to conveniently purchase their next item or pay their selling expenses.
""We see incredibly compelling growth potential in this market,"" Chief Executive Officer Jamie Iannone said.
The company also launched eBay Vault, a digital marketplace and storage facility for trading cards and collectibles, which is expected to launch in the United States in the next quarter. 
Shares of the company fell 1.1% to $52.5 in extended trading.

The company expects adjusted profit to rise about 10% in 2023, it said at its investor day. For fiscal 2024, eBay forecast revenue to grow in the range of 7% to 8%, and adjusted profit to rise about 15%.
Last month, eBay had forecast bleak first-quarter results as it tackles waning online demand, stiff competition and global supply chain disruptions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several public advocacy groups on Thursday called on U.S. regulators to block a bid by budget carriers Frontier Group Holdings and  Spirit Airlines  (NYSE:SAVE) Inc to create the fifth-largest U.S. airline, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Public Citizen, Fight for the Future, the American Economic Liberties Project and other six groups said in a letter to the Transportation and Justice Departments that a merger between the ultra-low-cost carriers ""would destroy competition in the only competitive market segment of the highly consolidated airline industry.""
The groups added: ""Travelers (NYSE:TRV) will pay higher prices for fewer and lower quality options, workers will lose their jobs, and smaller firms will be muscled out of a once-competitive market segment.""
The carriers did not immediately comment.
Separately, eight progressive lawmakers including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ben Ray Lujan and Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote U.S. regulators raising concerns about the airline deal valued at $6.6 billion saying the ""resulting Spirit-Frontier carrier could hurt consumers in numerous ways, consolidating market power for the airlines and reducing choices for travelers.""
The Justice Department did not immediately comment. The Transportation Department said it would respond to the lawmakers, adding the ""administration is committed to protecting competition and consumer protection across a wide range of industries.""
The proposed merger comes as the U.S. airline industry is grappling with volatility in travel due to COVID-19. At the same time, costs are soaring on a combination of sharply higher fuel prices and rising wages.
The merger, which is expected to close in the second half of 2022, is projected to result in synergies of $500 million annually, mainly through operational savings.

The companies pledged to avoid job losses and add 10,000 direct jobs by 2026 and say it would deliver $1 billion in annual consumer savings and offer more than 1,000 daily flights to over 145 destinations.
The DOJ has filed an antitrust lawsuit against American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Group Inc and JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU) Corp over their partnership, alleging it would lead to higher fares in busy Northeastern U.S. airports.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) on Thursday announced they were unwinding their Russian businesses, becoming the first major U.S. banks to exit following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and putting pressure on rivals to follow.
Operating in Russia has become harder for Western financial institutions due to international sanctions against that country.
While European banks are the most highly exposed to Russia, U.S. banks still have significant exposure, totaling $14.7 billion, according to Bank of International Settlements data.
""Goldman Sachs is winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements,"" the bank said in an emailed statement.
JPM said in a statement: ""In compliance with directives by governments around the world, we have been actively unwinding Russian business and have not been pursuing any new business in Russia."" 
Current activities are limited, and it is helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations, manage Russian-related risk, act as a custodian to clients and take care of employees, JPM said. 
Goldman will wind down the operations rather than exit them immediately and any losses would be ""immaterial,"" according to a source familiar with the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
In the aftermath of Russia's invasion last month of Ukraine, around half of Goldman Sachs employees in Moscow have moved or are moving to Dubai, three sources familiar with the matter said. The bank had around 80 staff members in Moscow. 
Some of the relocated staff will be involved in the winding down, working with colleagues still in Moscow, the sources said.
Goldman's Russia head is understood to be remaining in Moscow, one source said. 
In its annual filing, the bank had disclosed a credit exposure to Russia of $650 million.
Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 2.8% to $325.97 in midday trading. Up to the close of trading on Wednesday, GS had fallen 12.8% this year.
The biggest exposed U.S. bank is  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), which said on Wednesday it was operating its Russian consumer business on a more limited basis while sticking with its previous plans to divest the franchise.
Citigroup has total Russian exposure of nearly $10 billion and its chief financial officer has warned that in a ""severe stress scenario"" its loss might be half that.
Citigroup might be able to spread the pain of any Russia losses over several quarters by recording expenses to build reserves on some assets before the losses are final, said analyst David Hendler of Viola Risk Advisors.
""It might put pressure on earnings for the next couple of quarters,"" Hendler said.
Other U.S. banks operating in Russia include JPMorgan, which declined to comment on what its plans were. 
Goldman Sachs was seventh overall in generating investment banking income in Russia's last year, with Russia's VTB Capital top, JPMorgan second with $32.8 million,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) fourth with $27.3 million and Citigroup fifth with $22.8 million. Goldman Sachs generated $19.5 million last year, according to Refinitiv data.

In Europe, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is considering leaving Russia, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters previously. 
Banks will find it hard to extricate themselves from the market, however, experts have said, with the process taking months or even years.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock splits are becoming fashionable for megacap U.S. companies.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) unveiled a 20-for-1 stock split late on Wednesday, only weeks after megacap peer Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) did the same.
Other companies that have split their shares since 2020 include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).
""It’s a little bit of follow the leader,"" said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. ""You had Apple, you had Tesla, and just recently you had Alphabet.”
Though a company may decide to split its stock for various reasons, a cheaper price may make the shares more appealing to some investors, analysts said.
While a stock split ""does not affect company fundamentals"", it ""can increase liquidity by making shares more accessible to a wider range of investors,"" BofA Global Research analysts said in a note.
BofA found that splits ""historically are bullish"" for companies that enact them, with their shares marking an average returns of 25% one year later versus 9% for the market overall.
""Once the split is executed, investors who have wanted to gain or increase exposure may start to rush for the chance to buy,"" BofA said in the note.
Stock splits also significantly lower the per-contract price of trading options, which have been increasingly used by individual investors in recent years and so can potentially attract more retail players to the stock, according to some analysts.
For Amazon, the split may also be a way to recharge stock performance. The company's shares on Tuesday marked their lowest closing level since June 2020 and are still down 20% since mid-November amid a broad swoon for growth stocks. Amazon shares were up nearly 6% on Thursday after the company also announced a $10 billion buyback plan.
Amazon remains one of the biggest influences on the market-cap weighted S&P 500, with a market value of about $1.5 trillion.
As they did when Google-parent Alphabet announced its split, investors speculated on whether Amazon's stock split could pave the way for its addition to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. At around $2,900 a share, Amazon's current price is too unwieldy for the blue-chip Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that high-priced stocks have an outsized influence. 
The split would reduce its stock price to about $145 a share, putting it in the middle of the 30-member Dow, whose highest priced component is UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) at around $485 a share.

""Do Google or Amazon’s managements care about becoming Dow stocks like Apple?"" Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, asked in a research note. ""From a purely financial perspective, probably not; very little capital is indexed to the Average.""
However, Colas added: ""From the perspective of corporate recognition, the answer is likely 'perhaps'.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Airlines said Thursday it will allow unvaccinated employees to return to their jobs starting March 28 and asked a federal appeals court to dismiss a legal challenge to the COVID-19 mandate as moot.
The Chicago-based U.S. carrier said in a memo about 2,200 employees had received vaccine-related reasonable accommodations after it had become the first major U.S. airline to mandate employee vaccines. 
""We plan to welcome back those employees who have been out on an approved (accommodation) to their normal positions starting"" March 28, the memo said.
United told a federal appeals court Thursday the new policy was ""due to substantial changes in the scope and severity of the pandemic as well as the guidance of public-health authorities.""
United said the change applies to all employees who were placed on temporary unpaid leave as well as those temporarily placed in other jobs.
United Chief Executive Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) in December said that, of the company's 67,000 employees, about 200 did not comply with United's mandate and were fired. A United official said the airline has no plans to rehire those employees.
The memo noted the sharp decline in COVID-19 cases in the United States and that the CDC recently relaxed its mask guidelines.
The memo added, ""Of course, if another variant emerges or the OVID trends suddenly reverse course, we will reevaluate he appropriate safety protocols at that time.
A U.S. appeals court last month ordered a new review of a lower court decision not to block United from enforcing its employee vaccine mandate. United said Thursday the issue was now moot.
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to return the issue to a U.S. District judge who rejected a request for an injunction blocking the mandate while employees argue their case against it.

In a scathing dissent, Judge Jerry E. Smith said ""for every conceivable reason that the (employees) could lose this appeal, they should.""
Kirby in December defended the employee mandate: ""We did this for safety. We believe it saved lives.""

Investing.com --  After Disney+ announced its ad-supported subscription tier, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) revealed it has no plans to provide the same for its consumers, TechCrunch reported on Thursday.
Netflix shares are up 1% Thursday. 
Speaking at The  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, Netflix CFO Spencer Neumann is said to have explained that Netflix is not against advertising, but the company currently has no plans for the model. Neumann was quoted as saying it is ""not something that's in our plans.""
Questions were put to the Netflix CFO about advertising potentially decreasing the entrance price for Netflix's service and allowing it to compete as it grows into global markets where pricing may be sensitive to countries.
However, Neumann defended the current model, focusing on ""optimizing for long-term revenue"" and giving the best possible experience to customers.
The dilemma Netflix faces with a potential ad-supported model is that while it may help reduce a subscription cost, it will also potentially negatively impact the end-user experience.
However, the CFO did state that an ad-supported model is a possibility as long as the goal of offering users the best experience is not tarnished.
TechCrunch quoted Neumann as saying, ""right now, we think we have a great model and a subscription business that scales globally really well."" 
""We were about a $20 billion revenue business two years ago… we're $30 billion revenue now. The growth is healthy across every region of the world.""
Consumers debate Netflix's strategy, with some arguing that near-term growth is the best option, especially after the firm failed to meet Wall Street's subscriber growth forecasts for Q4. Furthermore, Netflix has had to contend with ever-rising competition in recent years.
In other Netflix news Thursday, the company is raising prices in the U.K. and Ireland for the second time in less than 18 months, according to a report by Reuters. The company is set to raise the price of its most popular subscription plan, which allows customers to watch on two screens at once, to £10.99 per month in the U.K. Netflix's premium plan will rise to £15.99 per month while the entry-level plan will move to £6.99."
1261,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 02:50PM ET</span>",'You got rich off our dead bodies' opioid victims tell Purdue's Sacklers,"By Tom Hals and Dietrich Knauth
(Reuters) - Victims of America's opioid epidemic confronted members of the Sackler family that owns Purdue Pharma on Thursday with wrenching stories of suffering they said was caused by the painkillers that built the company fortune.
""You got rich off our dead bodies and told us it was our own fault for dying,"" Ryan Hampton told Richard Sackler, a former board member, during a Zoom hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
The emotional court hearing stemmed from a $6 billion settlement between the Sacklers and state attorneys general that could resolve claims over the family's role in the crisis without taking them to trial.
Purdue Pharma allegedly downplayed the addiction risks of its OxyContin painkiller, helping to fuel a healthcare crisis that has claimed more than 500,000 opioid overdose deaths over two decades.
Members of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing. They said last week in a statement that they ""sincerely regret"" that OxyContin ""unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis.""
The 26 speakers were chosen by the official committee that represents creditors in Purdue's bankruptcy, including the thousands of people who filed personal injury claims against Purdue Pharma.
Their stories included the loss of a twin, a Korean War veteran begging his grandson for pills and anguished parents struggling to cope with loss and anger directed at the Sacklers.
David Sackler and Theresa Sackler attended by Zoom and David's father Richard Sackler did not appear on the video but told the court he was listening by phone. The Sacklers were not permitted to respond to the victims' statements and Hampton said they did not appear to react.
Kristy Nelson of Indiana played a recording of the emergency call she placed when she discovered her overdosed son and can be heard screaming, ""Oh my god he's dead!"" as the operator tries to extract information about her location.
While many U.S. overdose deaths were caused by illicit drugs such at heroin and fentanyl, often victims became addicted to opioids through pain medicines such as OxyContin prescribed for high school sports injuries or recovery from surgery.
Photographer Nan Goldin said an OxyContin addiction that began in 2014 almost ended her 50-year career, reducing her to a ""hermetic state"" in which she barely left her room for three years. She said the Sacklers should not be allowed to buy respectability through naming agreements with museums like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Louvre, calling it ""toxic philanthropy."" 
""Their legacy is forever tainted,"" Goldin said.
Richard Sackler told the bankruptcy court in August that the family did not bear responsibility for the crisis. At the same hearing, his son David testified that the family has a ""moral responsibility"" to help curb the opioid epidemic.
Both served as Purdue board members along with several other members of the family and have been named in lawsuits alleging they directed deceptive marketing of addictive painkillers.

Purdue filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2019, and the court extended to the Sacklers legal protections from being sued - one of the main benefits of seeking bankruptcy - despite the family members never filing for bankruptcy themselves.
That controversial protection is being challenged in court by the U.S. Department of Justice.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday tapped federal prosecutor Kevin A. Chambers to lead the department's efforts to help investigate fraudsters who used the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to bilk government assistance programs.
Chambers' appointment as the Justice Department's chief pandemic fraud prosecutor was previewed by President Joe Biden during last week's State of the Union address.
Chambers currently serves as the associate deputy attorney general, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
He worked as an assistant U.S. attorney from 2010 through 2014, and then worked at the law firm of Latham & Watkins. From June 2018 through January 2021, he served as the co-chair of the firm's Washington, D.C., litigation and trial department.
The Justice Department said Chambers intends to focus his efforts on larger-scale criminal enterprises and foreign actors, and that he will be setting up strike teams to prepare for the next wave of cases.
Tackling criminal and civil fraud stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic has been a Justice Department priority.
In May 2021, Attorney General Merrick Garland launched a COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force. That group, led by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, will meet on Thursday and formally announce Chambers' new role.
Many of the fraud cases the department investigates are pegged to U.S. government assistance programs, such as the Paycheck Protection Program, unemployment insurance and Medicare.
To date, the Justice Department said its enforcement efforts have alleged fraud tied to $8 billion in pandemic relief. 

It has brought over 1,000 criminal cases involving losses of $1.1 billion, and charged more than 1,800 individuals and businesses in civil litigation alleging fraud in more than $6 billion worth of loans.
“We will continue to hold accountable those who seek to exploit the pandemic for personal gain, to protect vulnerable populations, and to safeguard the integrity of taxpayer-funded programs,"" Garland said in a statement.

The company on Wednesday announced a 20-for-1 stock split, its first since 1999, and a $10 billion share buyback. It comes on the heels of a similar split announced by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc earlier this year.
""Amazon's management is looking to instill fresh confidence,"" AJ Bell Investment Director Russ Mould said, adding that the buyback was the company's first direct distributions of cash back to its shareholders since its stock market debut.
Amazon shares were up 5.4% to $2,936.99 in early trading on Thursday. The company's stock closed at $2,785.58 on Wednesday, near a two-year low after riding a pandemic-induced rally in tech and growth shares that brought it within striking distance of a $2 trillion valuation mark.
Amazon's stock ticker was trending on investor-focused social media site stocktwits.com and was among the most discussed on Reddit's wallstreetbets, according to sentiment aggregator Swaggystocks.
Shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc rallied sharply after their stock splits in 2020.
Amazon's stock split ""just makes inexperienced investors and traders feel better,"" said Perri Dong, a China-based portfolio manager at Redwood (NYSE:RWT) Winslow LLC, who said he owns Amazon shares. 
""It's just psychological. Some people believe the shares will have more liquidity, but I argue it doesn't matter."" 
Amazon shares have struggled along with other growth stocks in 2022, falling 16.5% year-to-date as of Wednesday's close. 
""To state the obvious, buybacks also suggest Amazon sees value in the stock here,"" BofA Global Research analysts said in a note, adding that the repurchases would amount to about 0.7% of shares outstanding.
The company went public in 1997 at an IPO price of $18, or $1.50 when adjusted for stock splits that occurred in 1998 and 1999. The latest stock split will take effect on June 6.

Amazon's share surge on Thursday was a bright spot in an otherwise gloomy market, where shares of megacap companies such as Apple and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) were trading lower.

""The process of integration and creation of a European defence and the increase in defence spending in EU and neighbouring countries could be accelerated, creating opportunities for companies operating in the sector,"" the group said in a statement on 2021 results.
It added its exposure to operators directly affected by sanctions against Russia was around 30 million euros ($32.97 million), with an order backlog with Moscow of about 25 million euros. 
The exposure to Ukraine was negligible.
The state-controlled group said it was monitoring the geopolitical situation closely and was aligned with Italy's government policies.
Last year Leonardo reported a free cash flow of 209 million euros and a 142% rise in net profit to 587 million euros, beating full-year guidance.
Revenue was up 5% to reach 14.1 billion euros, driven by sales in the governmental and defence businesses, which accounted for 88% of total.
""We are confirming our target of generating a cumulative 3 billion euro of cash flow over 2021-2025, with a significant step up in 2022,"" CEO Alessandro Profumo said, adding the group would return to paying a dividend based on its 2021 earnings.
This year, free operating cash flow is seen rising to 500 million euros and revenue is expected to be between 14.5 billion and 15 billion euros.
All the businesses have recovered pre-pandemic levels, excluding the Aerostructures division, which is under restructuring, the group said, adding it was seeing signs of recovery in the civil aeronautics business.

Germany, which has long played down the role of its military in foreign policy, as well as Denmark and Poland have all said they will ramp up defence spending with war at their doorstep.

According to a statement from Erdogan's office, he also told Biden that Turkey expected its request to purchase 40 new F-16 fighter jets and modernise its existing fleet to be finalised as soon as possible.
Ankara had initially ordered more than 100 F-35 jets, made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), but the United States removed Turkey from the programme in 2019 after it acquired Russian S-400 missile defence systems.
Turkey has called the move unjust and demanded reimbursement for its $1.4 billion payment.
Reuters reported last year that Ankara had made a request to Washington to buy 40 Lockheed Martin-made F-16s and nearly 80 modernization kits for its existing warplanes.
Turkey's purchase of the S-400s has also triggered U.S. sanctions. In December 2020, Washington blacklisted Turkey's Defence Industry Directorate, its chief, Ismail Demir, and three other employees.
A readout of Thursday's call from the White House did not mention a discussion about sanctions or Turkey's request regarding the F-16s. 
But it said Erdogan and Biden had talked about opportunities to strengthen ties, in addition to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The decades-old partnership between the NATO allies has gone through unprecedented tumult in recent years over disagreements on Syria policy, Ankara's closer ties with Moscow, U.S. charges against a state-owned Turkish bank and erosion of rights and freedoms in Turkey.
Washington has repeatedly warned Turkey against buying further Russian weaponry. Ankara has said it intends to go through with the purchase of a second batch of S-400s from Russia, a move that could worsen the diplomatic rift with the United States.

The request for the jets will likely have a difficult time getting approval from the U.S. Congress, where sentiment towards Turkey has soured deeply over recent years.
Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers urged the Biden administration in October not to sell F-16 fighter jets to Turkey and said they were confident Congress would block any such exports.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 moved off lows Thursday, but remained under pressure as hopes of a diplomatic solution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict suffered a setback, while inflation surged to fresh 40-year highs.
The S&P 500 fell 0.9%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, or 269 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.4%.
Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said there was “no progress” on discussions concerning a ceasefire, and said that demands from his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov would amount to a surrender for Ukraine, something the country isn't prepared to do. 
""Russia is not in a position at this point to establish a cease-fire. They seek a surrender from Ukraine. This is not what they're going to get,"" Kuleba said following a sit down with Russia’s Lavrov.
Many had hoped that Ukraine’s softer stance on seeking to join the NATO military alliance – in the days leading up to the meeting – would pave the path toward a diplomatic resolution.
The lack of a breakthrough renewed fears that prices for key commodities including oil, gas, wheat and corn -- key exports from Russia and Ukraine -- will remain elevated, and keep inflation higher for longer.
The consumer price index rose 0.8% in February, pushing inflation for the year through February to 7.9%, the hottest annual increase since January 1982.
“The risk is that the inflation we are enduring now could become more entrenched, as it did in the 1970s. That is why the Fed is so wedded to raising rates starting in March,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
Technology fell nearly 3% as investors fled big tech, though Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) bucked the trend after announcing a $10 billion share buyback program and a 20-for-1 stock split.
Falling semiconductor stocks also weighed on the tech sector on concerns that the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict will exacerbate supply problems for chip companies.
Financials pared their gains from a day earlier as banks were pressured by ongoing flattening in the yield curve in the wake of growing worries that red-hot inflation and slowing economic growth increase the risk of a recession.
U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) and Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) were sharply lower, with the latter down more than 5% as it announced Thomas P. (Todd) Gibbons would be retiring as chief executive on Aug. 31.
“The headwinds for banks is clearly the Russia exposure, but it's also the flattening in the yield curve,” Melissa Brown, managing director of applied research at Qontigo, an index and analytics provider, said in an interview with Investing.com on Thursday. “Higher rates are fine for banks as long as short term rates are lower, but if that's not the case, that's going to hurt banks.”
Energy stocks was one of the few sectors in the green even as oil prices erased their intraday gains.
The earnings front served up mostly positive results, with Crowdstrike garnering the bulk of investor attention.
Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) rolled out an upbeat outlook for the full-year after reporting quarterly results that topped Wall Street expectations on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 12% higher.
Asana (NYSE:ASAN) also reported better-than-expected quarterly results and guidance that surprised to the upside, but the outlook for increased growth will likely prove costly as the company ramps up investment. Its shares fell more than 23%.
“The product/sales expansion is coming at the expense of aggressive investment, which we expect investors to look at cautiously given the challenging macro/geopolitical environment,” Oppenheimer said as it cut price target on the stock to $85 from $100 amid valuation concerns."

Putin said there had been no alternative to what Russia calls its special military operation in Ukraine and that Russia was not a country which could accept compromising its sovereignty for some sort of short-term economic gain. 
""These sanctions would have been imposed in any case,"" Putin told a meeting of the Russian government. ""There are some questions, problems and difficulties but in the past we have overcome them and we will overcome them now.
""In the end, this will all lead to an increase in our independence, self-sufficiency and our sovereignty,"" he told a televised government meeting two weeks after Russian forces invaded neighbouring Ukraine.
His comments were designed to portray Western sanctions as self-defeating and reassure Russians that the country can withstand what Moscow is calling an ""economic war"" against its banks, businesses and business oligarchs.
Putin said Moscow - a major energy producer that supplies a third of Europe's gas - would continue to meet its contractual obligations even though it has been slammed with comprehensive sanctions including a ban on U.S. purchases of its oil.
""They announced that they are closing the import of Russian oil to the American market. Prices there are high, inflation is unprecedentedly high, has reached historic highs. They are trying to blame the results of their own mistakes on us,"" he said. ""We have absolutely nothing to do with it.""
Hitting back against the West, the Russian government said earlier it had banned exports of telecom, medical, auto, agricultural, electrical and tech equipment, among other items, until the end of 2022.
In total, over 200 items were included on the export suspension list, which also covered railway cars, containers, turbines and other goods.
'WE WILL SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS'
Speaking calmly, Putin acknowledged that sanctions imposed since the Feb. 24 invasion were being felt.
""It is clear that at such moments people's demand for certain groups of goods always increases, but we have no doubt that we will solve all these problems while working in a calm fashion,"" he said.
""Gradually, people will orient themselves, they will understand that there are simply no events that we cannot close off and solve.""
Putin noted that Russia is a major producer of agricultural fertilisers, and said there would be inevitable ""negative consequences"" for world food markets if the West made problems for Russia.
His agriculture minister reported at the meeting that the country's food security was ensured.
Speaking at the same meeting, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia had taken measures to limit the outflow of capital and that the country would service its external debts in roubles, not in dollars.
""Over the last two weeks Western countries have in essence waged an economic and financial war against Russia,"" he said.

Siluanov said the West had defaulted on its obligations to Russia by freezing its gold and foreign currency reserves. It was trying to halt foreign trade, he said.
""In these conditions the priority is for us to stabilise the situation in the financial system,"" Siluanov said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY) has started the sale process of its towers business and expects indicative offers in the next couple of weeks, three sources with knowledge of the deal said.
The German company is working with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) as advisor in the sale of its 40,600 masts, in a deal that could value the business at close to 18 billion euros ($19.9 billion), two of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A Deutsche Telekom spokesperson said the group was in the process of reviewing several options for the tower business - as announced last year on its capital markets day. 
Telecom towers have been the target of several big takeovers in the past few years as telecom companies seek to reduce debt and costs.
Deutsche Telekom needs cash to cut a massive debt pile of more than 130 billion euros and free up funds for investment in infrastructure and to secure the control of its U.S. business T-Mobile, which accounts for three-fifths of group sales.
Spanish mobile telephone infrastructure operator Cellnex and U.S.-based American Tower Corp (NYSE:AMT) are both readying offers, two of the sources said, as they race to expand in Europe for the roll-out of next-generation 5G technology.
Cellnex, Goldman Sachs and American Tower declined to comment. 
American Tower and Cellnex are the two largest independent tower operators in Europe. Cellnex has 130,000 tower sites in its portfolio.
American Tower has nearly 220,000 towers globally and a quarter of them in Europe, and about 170,000 towers are still owned by mobile network operators.
The deal may also attract interest from private equity groups or competitors such as Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD)'s Vantage or Orange's Totem.
Vantage has about 82,000 towers, while Totem has just 26,000.
Vodafone CEO Nick Read said in February that the next step for Vantage Towers should be a merger and Orange's Stephane Richard has flagged the possibility of joining Totem with one of the other operators in Europe.
While the conflict in Ukraine is prompting companies hoping to list shares to put plans on ice, mergers and acquisitions in the telecom industry are still happening.

This week, France's Orange (PA:ORAN) and Spain's MasMovil announced talks on a Spanish merger.

Analysts are paring back their expectations for this once-hyped stock ahead of Rivian’s fourth-quarter results, which are due after the market close on Thursday. At least four analysts have lowered their price targets this month by an average of 40%, according to Bloomberg data.  
The cuts come amid concerns that the war in Ukraine will further exacerbate the intense supply-chain problems that plagued the auto industry last year.  
“With investors increasingly concerned about Rivian’s production ramp combined with its inability to combat cost inflation with price increases, we have trimmed our price target to $47 from $115,”  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Brian Johnson wrote in a note to clients on March 8. Johnson maintained his hold equivalent rating on the stock. 
The electric-truck manufacturer’s initial public offering in November coincided with heightened investor appetite for all things EV, driving its market valuation to $153 billion at its peak a few weeks after the IPO. Barely four months later that value stands at about $36 billion, as the market sours on growth stocks amid concerns about growing inflation and an impending tightening of monetary policy -- not to mention the rising risks to the automotive supply chain. 
These sector-wide headwinds are bound to weigh heavily on newer EV companies, given the soaring costs of battery raw materials such as lithium and nickel. But Rivian’s challenges go much further, as seen in the company’s recent flipflop on a decision about the price of its trucks. 
Rivian said on March 1 that it would raise the prices on its debut vehicles for retail buyers, citing “unprecedented” supply-chain shortages. Then, two days later it back tracked after being hit by customer cancellations. That did not sit well with investors, who sent the stock down 32% over five trading sessions.
“Rivian needs to reassure its investors and customers that it has a handle on its supply chain and can accurately forecast what its costs will be and how it will price its trucks,” said Greg Martin, managing director and co-founder of Rainmaker Securities. 
Still, the average analyst price target on Rivian is fairly high at around $116, with 11 analysts rating it a buy, four recommending holding and only one with a sell rating. The reason is despite its issues, Rivian is still considered the best-positioned startup to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. in the rapidly growing EV market.
Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, whose last published note on the company was on Dec. 17 after the third-quarter results, is waiting for the company’s 2022 production target in order to update his model. Rivian’s “fair value is now dependent on its Street credibility,” he said.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 01:20PM ET</span>",Factbox-Mining companies distance themselves from Russia,"(Reuters) - Mining companies with ties to Russian businesses are scrambling to sever them in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Britain on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven high-profile Russian oligarchs including Oleg Deripaska, who partly owns EN+ Group, the parent company of UC Rusal, the world's second-largest aluminium producer.
Russia's ruling party, United Russia, said on Wednesday that a government commission had approved the first step towards nationalising the assets of foreign firms leaving the country in the wake of unprecedented economic sanctions over Ukraine.
What nationalisation would mean for Western mining companies involved in joint ventures with Russian companies, in Russia and elsewhere, is still unclear. 
Here are some of those stakes, assets and partnerships:
RIO TINTO 
The Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) this week said it is cutting all ties with Russian businesses, including fuel and other materials' sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi, where possible, and the use of an alumina refinery in Ireland. 
Rio Tinto has a joint venture with Rusal International PJSC, holding 80% of Queensland Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Ltd (QAL), Australia's second-largest refinery processing alumina, the chemical compound that contains aluminium. Rusal owns the remaining 20%. Being the majority stakeholder in the joint venture may make it more difficult for Rio to relinquish its ties with Rusal.
Rio Tinto also has a supply and offtake contract with Rusal Aughinish, Europe's largest alumina refinery in Ireland, which it is also looking to halt.
GLENCORE
The Swiss trader and miner Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) has a 10.5% stake in EN+ Group , which it said last week it is reviewing as well as its 0.57% stake in oil giant Rosneft . Rosneft's boss Igor Sechin is under British, European Union and U.S. sanctions.
Glencore did not comment further on Thursday and did not explain what the review of the stakes entails.
KINROSS GOLD
The Canadian gold miner  Kinross Gold  (NYSE:KGC) said last week it was suspending its Russian operations, including its Udinsk development project and its Kupol mine in northeastern Russia.
BHP GROUP
The world's largest mining company BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) said it does not sell into Russia, nor does it have any investments or commercial arrangements in Russia or with Russian organisations. 

ANGLO AMERICAN 
The London-listed miner  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) said it has no operations or offices in Russia, but it is ""assessing any commercial relationships with Russian businesses to ensure we make the right decisions.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Steve Rowe will step down as chief executive of Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) in May after six years in the job, with the British retailer opting for continuity by choosing two of his senior lieutenants as his successor.
Rowe, who joined M&S at the age of 15 before rising through the ranks, will step down after the food and clothing retailer reports annual results on May 25.
His tenure in one of the most high-profile jobs in British business has been turbulent as he, along with chairman Archie Norman, has sought to transform M&S by improving the quality and value of its clothing and food products, overhauling its store estate and investing heavily in technology and e-commerce, including a venture with Ocado (LON:OCDO) Group Plc that took M&S food online for the first time.
Having steered the retailer through the pandemic he exits as hopes are rising that one of Britain's most elusive turnarounds could finally materialise after more than a decade of false dawns.
M&S shares, which closed on Thursday at 159 pence, were trading at nearly four pounds when Rowe became CEO in April 2016. 
The group said current joint chief operating officers, Stuart Machin and Katie Bickerstaffe, will take over Rowe's responsibilities in an unconventional structure.
Machin will become CEO and will take on responsibility for day-to-day leadership of the business and the executive committee.
He will keep oversight of his current responsibilities, which include the leadership of M&S's food business, as well as operations, property, store development and technology, and will take on responsibility for human resources and corporate communications.
Bickerstaffe will become co-CEO with a focus on driving M&S's strategy of selling across multiple platforms, while retaining her existing responsibilities for clothing & home, MS2, international and financial services.
Both Machin and Bickerstaffe will join M&S's PLC board on May 25.
Machin, Bickerstaffe and Chief Financial Officer Eoin Tonge had been the favourites to succeed Rowe.
Tonge has been promoted to chief strategy & finance officer, playing an enhanced role in leading the future development of the business.
""The board's view is that under the current team, the business has made remarkable progress and that continuity of strategy and leadership is advantageous,"" M&S said.

However, some observers were left baffled by the new structure, saying it contradicted M&S's stated desire for a leaner, simpler business.
Rowe will cease being an M&S employee after its annual shareholders' meeting on July 5 but remain an adviser for up to a year.

Investing.com -- TikTok and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are close to finalizing an agreement to allow Oracle to keep TikTok's U.S. users' data in its servers without giving ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, access, according to a report from Reuters Thursday.
The news comes barely a year and a half after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) ordered ByteDance to remove its app, TikTok, from the market due to concerns about U.S. data being exposed and accessible by the Chinese government.
CFIUS's concerns over TikTok's data protection have persisted, but no action has been taken since Biden's takeover as President from Trump, with hopes of ByteDance addressing these issues further.
Oracle played a crucial role in potentially acquiring a minor stake in TikTok during the scrutiny faced by ByteDance in 2020. Now, the near deal will see storage of all TikToks' U.S. user data on Oracle's data servers, sources from Reuters state. This will be in addition to some of TikTok's information already being stored on Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) cloud.
TikTok is also looking at forming agreements with other technology companies to work on various security measures.
While the news may be seen as a positive for Oracle, its share price has seen little reaction, up 0.24% Thursday following Wednesday's 3.78% gain. "

Investing.com – Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock traded 1.1% lower Thursday on reports the Federal Aviation Administration is readying three safety directives for Boeing to implement so that some of its 777 planes, grounded for more than a year, can return to flying.  
The directives cover Boeing 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines.
According to Reuters, the engines are on only a small number of older 777s operated by Japan Airlines Ltd ADR (OTC:JAPSY), United (NASDAQ:UAL),  ANA Holdings Inc  ADR (OTC:ALNPY),  Korean Air Lines Co  (KS:003490),  Asiana Airline  (KS:020560) and  Jin Air  Co Ltd (KS:272450).
The manufacturer must now develop a service bulletin laying out steps airlines must take to meet requirements, the Reuters report said. The bulletin will need the FAA’s approval before the planes can return to service.
The new directives, which were proposed in December after three reported in-flight fan blade failures, call for enhanced inspections and modifications.
One directive requires the installing of debris shields on the thrust reverser inner wall, inspecting fan cowl doors for moisture ingression and repetitive checks of the hydraulic pump shutoff valves. Another requires modifying the engine inlet to withstand fan blade failure events. A third requires specific corrective actions depending on inspection results.
In a February 2021 incident, a United Airlines 777 showered debris over nearby cities, shortly after takeoff from Denver. No one was injured and the plane safely returned to the airport.
The directives will take effect in mid-April."

The bank said it would strive for a post-tax return on tangible equity (ROTE) - a key profit metric - of more than 10% by 2025.
The more ambitious goal comes as many investors still doubt whether Deutsche will achieve this year's target of 8%, which the bank is firmly standing by, though it acknowledged increased uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine. 
The new roadmap is the first since the bank embarked on a major overhaul in 2019, which involved exiting some businesses and cutting thousands of jobs after years of losses.
Under Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing, Deutsche has made progress, delivering its most profitable year in a decade last year.
But analysts' consensus is for the bank to achieve a ROTE of just 6% this year.
""For the full year 2022, we continue to expect to deliver a post-tax return on tangible equity of 8%,"" said Chief Financial Officer James von Moltke.
Deutsche is also aiming for a cost-to-income ratio of below 62.5% for 2025. That compares with 2021's ratio of 84.6% and the bank's target of 70% this year.

The bank said it would raise revenue to around 30 billion euros ($33.13 billion) by 2025, from a target of 25.4 billion euros this year.

GREENVILLE, S.C. (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co on Thursday reiterated its 2022 earnings forecast, but said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to business uncertainty.
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate last month warned that its profits would suffer in the first half of this year due to persistent supply-chain and inflationary pressures.
A run-up in global commodity prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine has worsened the situation.
At the company's first in-person investor meeting in more than two years, Chief Executive Larry Culp said the company's outlook has not incorporated the potential fallout of the situation in Ukraine as there are ""too many uncertainties.""
""Like every company directly or indirectly exposed to what's happening, there's more uncertainty today with respect to what lies ahead than we saw just a month ago,"" Culp said.
""There are really things we don't know.""
Culp said GE would be ""hyper-focused"" on controlling the things it can control.
On Tuesday, the company said it has suspended its operations in the country and is working with authorities to ensure compliance with sanctions.
Culp said Russia accounts for less than 2% of the company's overall sales. Its power business, however, has a bigger exposure to the country.
Russia's invasion has also put the supplies of titanium from the country in doubt. The metal is used in the aerospace industry to make landing gear, blades and turbine discs.
GE said its aviation unit uses Russian supplies for just two parts for which it has more than a year of inventory on the shelf. Overall, it sources just 1% of its titanium supplies from Russia. 
Mounting concerns about supply-chain and inflation have hurt GE's shares, which are down 11% since mid-January. Its shares were down 1.2% at $90.12 in mid-day trade.
The company has said it is raising prices and trying to keep a lid on costs. It is also trying to source alternative parts to help to deal with shortages.
GE, which last November said it would split into three public companies, reaffirmed the timeline for the spin-offs.
It plans to spin off its healthcare business into a separate publicly traded company next year. It would combine its power and renewable energy units, and spin off that operation in 2024. Following the split, it will become an aviation company.
GE expects to post high-single-digit revenue growth this year on the back of a more than 20% increase in aviation revenue.

Adjusted profit for the year is projected to be in the range of $2.80 per share to $3.50 per share. It also expects to grow its profit margin by 150 basis points and to generate $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion in free cash flow.
The company expects to generate about $10 billion in adjusted operating profit and more than $7 billion in free cash flow in 2023.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 11:28AM ET</span>",Factbox-What are Europe's options in case of Russian gas disruption?,"By Nina Chestney
(Reuters) - European gas prices have risen as sanctions on Russia have been tightened over its invasion of Ukraine and amid fears of supply disruptions.
Earlier this week, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said Russia was fulfilling its gas supply obligations but that it would be entirely within its rights to retaliate against the European Union after Germany last month froze the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
The arrival of Russian troops at two gas compressor stations in eastern Ukraine poses a risk to European supplies, Ukraine's gas pipeline operator warned on Thursday, but there were no signs of an immediate impact on flows.
HOW RELIANT IS EUROPE ON RUSSIAN GAS?
Europe depends on Russia for about 40% of its natural gas, with most transported by pipeline. Rystad Energy estimates 52 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year comes to Europe via Ukraine or nearby routes, while total Russian supplies to Europe are about 150 bcm to 190 bcm.
Some pipelines transit Ukraine, while others take alternative routes, such as Yamal-Europe, which crosses Belarus and Poland to Germany, and Nord Stream 1, which runs under the Baltic Sea to Germany.
Most European countries have cut reliance on Russian gas in recent years. In 2021, the Ukraine transit corridor was mainly used for gas going to Slovakia and then to Austria and Italy.
U.S. President Joe Biden this week imposed an immediate ban on Russian oil and other energy imports and Britain said it would phase out imports through the end of 2022.
Other countries are trying to wean themselves off Russian gas. The EU has said it wants to cut Russian gas by two-thirds this year and end its reliance on Russian supplies ""well before 2030"".
WHERE ELSE CAN EUROPE GET SUPPLY FROM? 
Some countries have alternative supply options and Europe's gas network is linked up so supplies can be shared, although the global gas market was tight even before the Ukraine crisis.
Germany, Europe's biggest consumer of Russian gas which has halted certification of the new Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia because of the Ukraine crisis, could import gas from Britain, Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands via pipelines.
Norway's Equinor said it is considering ways to produce more gas from its Norwegian fields during the upcoming summer in Europe, a season in which output is normally affected by maintenance.
Southern Europe can receive Azeri gas via the Trans Adriatic Pipeline to Italy and the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) through Turkey.
The United States, which exports shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG), has also sought to help Europe by asking LNG producers at home and abroad to ramp up supplies.
LNG imports to northwest Europe, including from the United States, have hit record highs this year.
But Qatar, one of the world's top LNG producers, has said no single country can replace Russian supplies to Europe, with most volumes tied to long-term supply contracts.
Europe's LNG terminals also have limited capacity for extra imports, although some European countries say they are looking at ways to expand imports and storage.
Britain, which is much less reliant on Russian gas than its European neighbours, has said it will look at all options to boost energy supplies.
ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS TO COPE WITH A GAS SUPPLY CRUNCH?
Several nations could seek to fill any gap in energy supplies by turning to electricity imports via interconnectors from neighbouring states or by boosting power generation from nuclear, renewables, hydropower or coal.
The European Commission said this week that gas and LNG from countries like the United States and Qatar could this year replace 60 billion cubic metres (bcm), of the gas Europe gets annually from Russia. By 2030, increased biomethane and hydrogen use could also help.
New wind and solar projects could replace 20 bcm of gas demand this year, while tripling capacity by 2030, adding 480GW of wind and 420 GW of solar energy, could save 170 bcm a year.
Turning down thermostats by 1°C could save an extra 10 bcm this year, while by 2030, replacing gas boilers with 30 million heat pumps could save 35 bcm, the Commission added.
Nuclear availability is falling in Belgium, Britain, France and Germany as plants are facing outages as they age or are decommissioned or phased out.
Europe has been trying to shift away from coal to meet climate targets but some coal plants have been switched back on since mid-2021 because of surging gas prices. 
Germany has said it could extend the life of coal or nuclear plants to cut reliance on Russian gas.
The head of a gas lobby said Germany could increase its domestic production at fields concentrated in the north of the country.
In past crises, countries have also sought to reduce industrial production at certain times, pay back-up generators to switch on supply, order households to curtail energy use or enforce temporary power cuts.
A spike in electricity prices has forced small German steelmaker Lech-Stahlwerke to halt production at its plant in Bavaria, the German state's only steel works.
Norwegian fertiliser-maker Yara is also curtailing its ammonia and urea output in Italy and France. 
HAS SUPPLY TO EUROPE BEEN DISRUPTED BEFORE?
The last 15 years have seen several disputes between Russia and Ukraine over gas, mostly to do with prices paid. 

In 2006, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) cut supplies to Ukraine for one day. In the winter of 2008/2009, Russian supply disruptions rippled across Europe. Russia cut off supplies to Kyiv in 2014 after Moscow annexed Crimea.
Ukraine stopped buying Russian gas in November 2015 and has instead imported gas from EU countries, by reversing the flow in some of its pipelines.

(Reuters) - Ethiopian Airlines has emerged as the unidentified buyer of five Boeing (NYSE:BA) current-generation 777 freighters reported this week, two people familiar with the matter said. 
The order, posted as an unnamed airline in Boeing's monthly orders update on Tuesday, is separate from a recently announced provisional agreement by Ethiopian for later deliveries of five of a successor model, the 777X freighter, also known as the 777-8 cargo version.
Ethiopian ordered the current-generation 777 freighters to meet near-term cargo demand, the sources said. 
Boeing declined to comment. The airline did not respond to a request for comment.
It was not immediately clear whether the airline would press ahead with both sets of orders, but several airlines have been aggressively adding capacity to address a boom in cargo demand.
The airline operates Africa's largest cargo terminal from its Addis Ababa hub.
The International Air Transport Association said on Wednesday that growth in demand had softened in January due in part to the impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant.
But supply chain disruptions that surfaced at the start of the pandemic recovery and stoked air cargo demand are still present.
CARGO DEMAND
Boeing has dominated the air freight market for years through its 767, 777 and 747 cargo jets and has been galvanizing support for the new twin-engined 777X freighter. 
The plane - officially known as 777-8F - was launched in January with an order for 34 from Qatar Airways. It is due to enter service in 2027, behind a long-delayed passenger version.
Boeing on Friday said it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Ethiopian Airlines with ""the intent to purchase"" five 777X freighters. Sources said the wording did not rule out further comparisons by the airline between cargo versions of the 777X and Airbus' rival A350. 
Ethiopian Airlines operates nine 777 freighters. Its fleet also includes three 737-800 converted freighters, Boeing said. 

About half of global cargo by value travels by air, and in turn half of that usually goes in the belly of passenger planes. 
During the pandemic, many airlines have been forced to park unused passenger jets, driving up demand for cargo space on dedicated freighters. But some economists warn that could start to unravel as the pandemic eases.

LONDON (Reuters) - Companies in the United States and elsewhere will voluntarily use new global climate-related disclosures even if making them a mandatory requirement takes longer, the chair of a new standard setter said on Thursday.
The International Sustainability Standards Board was set up in November at the COP26 climate summit to try to give more coherence to disclosures from companies and stop potential ""greenwashing"" or inflated climate-friendly credentials.
ISSB chair Emmanuel Faber said the Frankfurt-based board's first set of standards would be put to public consultation this month.
ISSB sister body, the International Accounting Standards Board, took over 20 years to persuade 140 countries one-by-one to make its norms mandatory.
""We don't have 25 years to get there, we have a few years,"" Faber told the London Business School, adding there was an alternative markets-directed pathway.
""If you look at the U.S., probably there will be a lot of adoption directly by market participants. They may well decide to adopt even without their home country being a formal adopter,"" the former chair of French yoghurt maker Danone said.
The draft disclosures will focus on greenhouse gas emissions from a company itself, emissions related to a company's energy use, and emissions from a company's supply chain and products, such as cars.
The aim is to replace a patchwork of standards with a global baseline called for by investors for countries and regions to build on, if they want to.
For example, the European Union has introduced more ambitious ""double materiality"", which measures a company's impact on the environment and not just how climate change will affect a company's bottom line.
Faber said that ""politically driven noise"" over double materiality needs to be ""shut down"" as it was not opposed to the global baseline approach ISSB is taking - just building on its common starting point. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also is due on March 21 to propose how companies can disclose the impact of climate change on their business.

""We expect that in the U.S. the SEC baseline it going to be compatible with where we will start with the global baseline, and then it will be up to local companies to voluntarily adopt the global standards,"" Faber said.

Investing.com – Xpeng stock (NYSE:XPEV) plummeted 10% Thursday on concerns over its international expansion in markets where it runs into competitors such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p).
The company is taking pre-orders of its P5 electric sedan in four European countries, including Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. Bookings can be made through the website or the company’s mobile app.
In August, it began shipments of its P7 sedan to Norway, its first international market and one of the early ones to have taken to EVs.
Last month, it opened its first store outside of China in Stockholm. It has plans to open another in the Netherlands, according to CNBC.
The company has made some modifications to the model it’s selling in Europe. The European P5 is being sold with an older version of the driving software system, Xpilot 2.5, that makes the vehicle close to autonomous.
CNBC said Xpeng’s European P5 will also not have Lidar technology, an acronym for Light Detection and Ranging. Lidar is the technology behind more advanced autonomous driving features, though Xpilot 2.5 works without Lidar.
Xpeng sold 6,225 vehicles in February compared to Nio (NYSE:NIO)'s 6,131 units.  "

Investing.com -- Branded footwear and accessories retailer  Genesco Inc  (NYSE:GCO) reported its fourth quarter earnings before the bell Thursday, beating earnings expectations.
The company reported earnings per share of $3.48, beating analyst expectations of $2.59 per share.
However, revenue came in below forecasts at $727.66 million. Analysts polled by Investing.com expected revenue of $728.25 million.
Genesco is trading almost 9% above Wednesday's close following the report.
The company revealed same-store sales for Genesco increased 10% over last year, while e-commerce sales increased 36% from the fourth quarter two years ago.
Genesco's full-year net sales increased 36% from last year to $2.4 billion, with adjusted earnings per share for the period at $7.62.
""We concluded an outstanding year with a very strong fourth quarter that far exceeded our expectations. Our holiday performance was fueled by unprecedented levels of full-price selling and strong in-store sales while our digital channel held on to most of last year's record gains,"" said Mimi E. Vaughn, Genesco president and chief executive officer.
""Fiscal 2023 has gotten off to a strong start compared with last year, however, we expect this trend to moderate in the near-term as we anniversary last year's March stimulus payments and first half sales revert to more normalized, pre-pandemic patterns,"" added Vaughn.
The company sees fiscal 2023 sales up between 2% to 4%, with adjusted earnings per share for the period from $7 to $7.75."

Investing.com – Marqeta Inc. (NASDAQ:MQ) stock gained 5% Thursday after the card-issuing platform said current quarter net revenue will grow 48-50% after annual total processing volume for the year crossed $100 billion for the first time.
The company’s outlook indicates little let-up in the payments business which boomed in the pandemic as people took to online shopping and ordering like never before.
Total processing volume climbed 85% to $111 billion in 2021 while rising 76% in the December quarter to $33 billion.
The company, which counts Uber (NYSE:UBER) and DoorDash (NYSE:DASH) as clients, grew its fourth quarter revenue 76% to $155 million. The company attributed this to higher TPV from existing large customers and continued growth in TPV from both its digital banking and buy-now-pay-later customers.
Last month, the company tied up with Plaid to enable customers to securely authenticate their bank accounts and fund their accounts to power more immediate spending.
Alongside its support for Klarna’s business in North America and Asia-Pacific,  Marqeta  expanded its partnership with Klarna into 13 new European markets.
Net loss widened more than two-and-a-half times to $37 million, owing to higher spend on technology and compensation to staff."

At least 21 large U.S. and Canadian energy companies have bought back their own stock in the last quarter, with the move continuing this year in the buildup to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) Co. signaled late in January it could use excess free cash flow to buyback shares and more recently, Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). launched a $3 billion buyback program.
To Wall Street strategists schooled in the logic of “buy low, sell high” this makes little sense particularly at a time when oil revenues are surging and the stocks hit yearly, multi-year or -- in some cases -- all-time highs. Even some companies are scratching their heads.
“People buy back their stock, historically, at the top in our industry,”  Pioneer Natural Resources  (NYSE:PXD) Co. CEO Scott Sheffield said at the CERAWeek by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) conference in Houston. “Not one U.S. company bought their stock in 2020, which is when we should have been buying our stock.”
Laura Lau, senior vice-president and chief investment officer at Toronto-based investment manager Brompton Group believes that raising dividends would be a more efficient way to get capital to shareholders. 
“Personally, I like money in my hands,” Lau said in an interview.

The S&P 500 energy index touched the highest level since May 2015 this week, up 105% since the start of 2021, as Russia’s war in Ukraine pushed Brent and West Texas Intermediate crude to around $120 a barrel. The windfall has helped 24 of the 53 members of the S&P 500 Energy Index and S&P/TSX Composite Energy Index double recent quarterly year-over-year revenues, Bloomberg data shows. 
Oil fell 10% on Wednesday, but more than half the members of the S&P 500 Energy Index and S&P/TSX Composite Energy Index are still trading near 52-week highs.
Occidental, which also hit a 52-week high on Monday, raised eyebrows when it announced on Feb. 24 a $3 billion buyback program in light of the mound of debt it took on for its $55 billion takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). in 2019. The Texas-focused oil producer’s net debt was $27.7 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.
Occidental representatives pointed to chief financial officer Rob Peterson comments last month saying the company intends to pay down another $5 billion in debt before initiating share repurchases. He added the goal is to “reward shareholders with the triple benefit of a sustainable common benefit, an active share repurchase program, and a continuously strengthening financial position.”
Not Attractive
“Though we support returning cash to stakeholders via dividends, the $3 billion share-buyback program does nothing for the company’s financial health,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vincent Piazza wrote on Occidental’s buyback.
Similarly, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently recommended investors buy dividend-paying companies as a hedge against inflation. And Desjardins Securities analyst Justin Bouchard wrote in a recent note that “there is a price at which buybacks cease to be attractive.”
For companies including Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd., messages such as Bouchard’s have yet to resonate. 
The company spent $1.26 billion on buying back its own stock in the fourth quarter, even as it breached a previous all-time high. For this year, the Canada’s largest oil and gas company plans to spend 50% of its free cash flow buying back up to 10% of its shares, which are up nearly 40% since January.
“The longer sky-high commodity prices persist, the sooner CNQ will have to reevaluate its current capital allocation framework,” Bouchard wrote.
CNQ representatives didn’t reply to a request for comment.

The company increased prices for the most affordable versions of Model 3 and Model Y about a dozen times last year in the United States, according to data tracked by Reuters.
The U.S. price of the EV maker's Model Y Long Range car has jumped 20% from January 2021, along with a 10.6% hike for its Model 3 Long Range sedan during the same period.
The move comes amid surging raw material costs, made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and could set back the dream of Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and other auto executives to roll out more affordable electric vehicles.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday on disappointment at the failure of ceasefire talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers.
Negotiations between Sergey Lavrov and Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey, the highest-level contact between the two countries since Russia invaded two weeks ago, broke down quickly with no visible progress. 
The downbeat mood was reinforced later by U.S. consumer inflation data for February, which showed prices rising at their fastest in over 40 years, cementing expectations of a first interest rate hike in two weeks' time from the Federal Reserve. 
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 325 points, or 1.0%, while the S&P 500 was down by a similar amount and the Nasdaq Composite was down by 1.4%. The three indices had gained between 2% and 3.6% on Wednesday in anticipation of the talks.
The annual rate of inflation accelerated to 7.9% in February, in line with expectations but the highest since January 1982. Core inflation also rose to a 40-year high of 6.4% as the extraordinary amount of liquidity created by the Fed during the pandemic seeped into an ever-broader cross-section of prices. 
""The Russia-Ukraine war adds further fuel to the blazing rate of inflation via higher energy, food, and core commodity prices that are turbo charged by a worsening in supply chain problems,"" said Kathy Bostjancic of Oxford Economics in a note to clients. ""This will lead to a higher near-term peak in inflation and a slower descent through 2022 than previously envisaged.""
Bostjancic expects inflation to average 6.5% this year, leading the Fed to raise rates by 175 basis points. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock bucked the negative  trend in early dealings, rising 4.8% thanks to the announcement late on Wednesday of a new $10 billion buyback program and a 20-for-1 stock split that's aimed at making the stock more easily accessible to smaller investors. It had been down some 15% for the year as of Wednesday's close.
Amazon's e-commerce peers in China fell under a harsher spotlight, as JD.com reported its slowest sales growth in six quarters, along with an operating loss due to higher input costs. JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) ADRs fell 14%, dragging rival  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) down by a similar amount. Chinese online realtor Ke Holdings (NYSE:BEKE) fell an even bigger 16% after reporting a stubbornly wide net loss and a worsening operating margin in the fourth quarter. 
Elsewhere, business software group Asana (NYSE:ASAN) fell 24% after it forecast revenue growth would slow to 40% this year from 67% last year, when the pandemic and the spread of remote work had created more favorable conditions for it. The opposite was true for Crowdstrike  (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock, which rose 13% after the company posted strong quarterly numbers and predicted another good year ahead.
Defense stocks  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon (NYSE:RTX) and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) all also eked out gains after the House of Representatives approved a revised spending bill for the current year late on Wednesday which incorporated a last-minute hike hike in defense spending."
1296,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 09:41AM ET</span>",Russia draft law raises doubt over fate of $10 billion of jets,"By Tim Hepher and Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Russia published a draft law on Thursday that could prevent its airlines returning leased aircraft, raising the stakes in a showdown with Western finance over $10 billion of jets.
Sanctions imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine give leasing firms until March 28 to free themselves from deals with Russian airlines, sparking a game of cat-and-mouse as lenders try to seize back jets - with very little success.
Under the proposed law drafted by the transport ministry, Russian airlines will pay leases in roubles throughout 2022.
If a foreign lessor terminates the agreement, a special government commission is to decide whether the aircraft can be returned or rule that the aircraft must stay in Russia.
""It is a bad offer tied to an even worse offer,"" said Eddy Pieniazek, head of analytics and advisory at UK-based aviation consultancy Ishka.
The rouble has plunged around 30% since Russia sent troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, prompting sanctions from the West. 
Leasing contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, the currency in which the mainly Ireland-based leasing industry usually borrows money and pays for aircraft.
If contracts are terminated, an international treaty called the Cape Town Convention calls for airlines to return planes with minimum interference, something Western sources say is not happening though Russia insists the sanctions are improper.
""Cape Town should come into play meaning an orderly process of aircraft recovery. What they are suggesting is breaking terms of contracts for all the aircraft,"" Pieniazek said.
Sanctions have already cut off the supply of most aircraft and parts to Russia and forced its carriers to cancel many international flights for fear their aircraft will be seized by foreign lessors or banks.
They have also frozen much of Russia's foreign reserves and forced authorities to look for ways to limit foreign currency outflows.
MASS DEFAULT
For the global leasing industry, which owns more than half of the world's airliner fleet, the standoff risks what experts have described as its largest mass default, though the immediate impact is dwarfed by global groundings in the COVID-19 crisis.
The resulting flood of claims could trigger a decade-long legal battle between lessors and insurers amid uncertainty whether war-risk policies will pay out, experts say.
Lessors worry the crisis could lead to insurance contracts being cancelled amid the lack of a clear blueprint over what happens next, and are seen likely to delay taking writedowns until it is clear whether they can be compensated.
On Thursday, BOC Aviation, which has 4.8% of its assets by book value leased to Russian airlines, became one of the first lessors to voice insurance concerns. 
""The international aviation insurance markets are progressively cancelling certain elements of insurance policies in relation to aircraft located in Russia or leased to Russian airlines,"" it said with its results.
""This is a complex and rapidly developing situation that we are monitoring closely."" 
In total there are almost 780 jets leased by Russian airlines, including 515 from foreign lessors.
Some 425 of these are most immediately at risk, according to consultants Ascend by Cirium.

The world's largest lessor, Dublin-based AerCap, has the largest exposure by number of units with 152 planes rented to Russian airlines, according to industry data.
It declined comment on the draft law on Thursday but said on Feb. 28 around 5% of its fleet by net book value was on lease to airlines in Russia and that it would cease activity there.

The production of the Panda in Pomigliano, for which the group had never provided an end date, will add to output of Alfa Romeo's new sport utility vehicle (SUV) Tonale, which is about to start at the plant
Stellantis, which owns the Fiat and Alfa Romeo brands, said a deal to build a battery plant in Italy for electric vehicles was imminent, unions said after the meeting.
The so called 'gigafactory', to be built through the ACC joint venture with Mercedes and TotalEnergies in Termoli, southern Italy, by the reconversion of an existing engine facility, would be the third for the group in Europe, after those already announced in France and Germany.

Representatives of the UILM union said in a statement that the updates on Termoli and Pomigliano indicated Stellantis commitment to Italy during the transition to electric mobility.
A source close to Stellantis, which last week presented its business plan to 2030, confirmed that progress had been made towards closing a deal on the Termoli battery plant shortly and that the company was confirming Italy's central role in its strategy.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Ryan Cohen's RC Ventures LLC, which owns nearly 10% of Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY), has hired a proxy solicitor, signalling the firm is ramping up for a potential proxy fight at the housewares retailer, two sources said. 
RC Ventures has retained Harkins Kovler, the solicitor frequently used by prominent activist investor Carl Icahn in his corporate battles, said the sources, who are not permitted to discuss the private matter publicly.
A representative for Cohen did not respond to requests for comment. Harkins Kovler declined to comment.
A proxy solicitor polls shareholders on how they plan to vote on hotly contested corporate matters such as mergers or proxy fights. 
Hiring one signals that Cohen is taking the next steps to prepare for a potential fight with Bed Bath & Beyond.
Cohen, who co-founded online pet food company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and is chairman of the board at GameStop (NYSE:GME), disclosed his stake in Bed Bath & Beyond in a letter in which he urged the company to narrow its focus on operational and inventory improvements.
He also urged the company to consider strategic alternatives, including a possible sale or spin-off of its buybuy Baby business.
In the letter, Cohen estimated buybuy Baby could be worth billions of dollars on its own now that sales are nearing $1.5 billion with double-digit margins.
A source familiar with Cohen's thinking said the investor is open to a negotiated compromise with the company if it includes significant boardroom change and a committee to review strategic alternatives led by new independent directors.
Bed Bath & Beyond's board currently has 11 members.
At the same time, Cohen is also preparing for a potential fight by selecting potential director candidates, the source said.

Since Cohen's stake became known, Bed Bath & Beyond's stock price has surged 39%.

(Reuters) - The $100 billion Western rental car industry, flush with cash from a profitable pandemic, is gradually getting its electric show on the road, and Chinese-made vehicles are poised to play a starring role. 
The electric transition could see car fleets, long dominated by famed marques from the United States and Europe, increasingly switch towards Asian automakers, according to a European executive. 
""Historically, European and American manufacturers had an edge, but the shift towards electric is reshuffling the cards,"" said Olivier Baldassari, group chief countries and operations officer at rental giant Europcar.
He said electric cars from Chinese and Asian makers were comparable to Western models in terms of quality, citing Great Wall Motor's Ora line, but generally cost less.
Even small savings are significant in the vast rental industry, which buys millions of new cars a year - a tenth of all new cars in the United States alone - and provides a leading indicator of wider auto trends in society.
Companies in the sector have long resisted a rush to electrify because of weak demand for electric vehicles (EVs) among customers worried about being stranded out of power. 
Yet several analysts said now is the best time to start as companies have fortified their coffers with bumper profits during a pandemic that emptied public transit and airports, and led to more holidaying within driving distance.
In the United States, rental car companies received record monthly revenue of $1,320 per vehicle in 2021, according to the American Car Rental Association. That compares to around $1,000 pre-pandemic.
""In the past, companies have kind of stuck their head in the sand,"" said Nick Mountfield, associate partner at OC&C Strategy Consultants, which advises rental car companies, said about electrification. ""We're now starting to see people say that they'll have to do something about and put in place plans.""

WATCH YOUR SPEED
Hertz was an early mover last October when it announced the planned purchase of 100,000 vehicles from U.S. trailblazer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), upping the pressure on rivals to spell out transition plans.
French-based Europcar, meanwhile, pledged to make 20% of its fleet electric or low-emission hybrid by 2024, from 3% now, which means it will need to buy up to 70,000 cleaner vehicles in the coming two years if it restocks its fleet to the 350,000 vehicles it owned pre-pandemic. 
Rental companies sold off their fleets as demand plummeted at the start of the pandemic and have struggled to regain volumes amid a global shortage of semiconductors that has hampered vehicle production. 
Baldassari said Europcar was increasingly sourcing EVs from Great Wall Motors, SAIC Motor and Polestar, which is owned by China's Geely and Volvo Cars, though it was also buying from traditional partners, including  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Stellantis. 
The company's China strategy might shift, however, if German carmaker Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) manages to close its offer to buy the company in the second quarter.
Industry players are running at different speeds, with each making their own calculations based on their markets. 
In the United States, where many customers prefer SUV and pickup models that have yet to be electrified and public charging infrastructure lags much of Asia and Europe, Enterprise Holdings is striking a more cautious tone.
Electrifying just a quarter of Enterprise's fleet at Orlando airport - its largest consumer rental location - would require the same amount of daily electricity as is needed to power more than 1,000 homes, said Enterprise's assistant vice president of innovation, Chris Haffenreffer.
Haffenreffer said the group currently had several thousand EVs in North America, including from Tesla, Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Hyundai, Kia and Polestar. While the company said it has conversations with all global automakers, it has no immediate plans to boost that share. 
""At a high level, we want to let our consumers guide us in terms of what they're looking for,"" he added. ""Many car rental companies have historically taken that wait-and-see approach because we are still in the early phases of the transition."" 
Graphic on U.S. industry vehicle purchases: https://tmsnrt.rs/3gXAVnj
FOOTHOLD IN THE WEST
The varied pace of change, and the timeline for vast fleet overhauls means gasoline-powered vehicles are expected to remain the bulk of purchases for some years to come. Global automakers' transition plans as a whole would see electric vehicles make up at least 40% of their sales by 2040. 
Yet eventually the shift could prove far-reaching for the fortunes of Chinese in carmakers in Europe, a crowded, competitive auto market dominated by storied brands that has proved elusive for them to crack in the past. 
In years gone by, they have contended with a perception that China, associated with cheap mass-production, could not compete on quality. Yet such arguments are challenged in a new reality that sees top Western carmakers like BMW and Tesla now produce cars in the country, which is a technology powerhouse and the world's biggest auto market. 

Great Wall Motor, one of Europcar's suppliers, is expected to launch its Ora Cat compact electric car in Europe this year priced at around 20,000 euros ($22,260) with a range of around 250 miles (400 km), joining a growing number of Chinese EV makers trying their luck on the continent.
Chinese manufacturers using the rental channel to establish brand awareness and increase sales volumes would follow a playbook Kia and Hyundai used in the 1990s to gain a foothold in Western markets, said Mountfield at OC&C Strategy.

Investing.com – Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock traded 0.6% lower in premarket Thursday amid reports the maker of fitness equipment is testing new pricing plans.
According to The Wall Street Journal, the company on Friday will start testing a new package in which customers pay a monthly fee that covers both the namesake stationary bike and a monthly subscription to workout courses. If a customer cancels, Peloton will take back the bike with no charge.
Stores in Texas and Florida will begin bundling $60-$100 monthly subscriptions Friday onward, the report said. This will be a limited period offer and is intended to help the company discover a profitable price proposition, the report said.
The purpose is to position Peloton as a service that can be dropped any time compared to a costly hardware that comes with a subscription.
The new strategy is the brainchild of former Netflix CFO Barry McCarthy who took over as CEO last month after pressure from investors forced co-founder John Foley to leave that room.
McCarthy’s appointment followed a tumultuous year for the company where it went from being a pandemic winner to a big loser as a waning virus and reopening of economies returned people to parks and gyms outside.
The company decided to cut costs and talked about layoffs even before attempts at going mass-market with reduced product prices could yield results.
It lost more than 80% of its market value which led to speculation it could become a takeover target. Media reports named Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among potential suitors."

Peloton, which saw its shares tumble more than 80% in the past year due to waning demand for the company's stay-at-home exercise equipment, is looking to revitalize sagging sales and win back investor confidence.
The company said it has created a limited pilot program to explore pricing and options for new members, but did not reveal details about the plan.
According to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the move, select Peloton stores in Texas, Florida, Minnesota and Denver will offer a bike and subscription to workout courses at a price between $60 and $100 a month for a limited period from Friday.
Shares of Peloton were down about 2% before the bell.
The pricing experiment aims to find a price proposition helping the company return to profitability without hampering growth, the report said. 
Upon cancellation, the company will take back the bike with no charge, the WSJ reported.
Last month, the company reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and slashed its forecast for full-year revenue, saying the lowered outlook was to adjust to changes in demand brought on by the reopening of economies.

Barry McCarthy, who took over as the company's chief executive last month, told the WSJ that he plans to reshape his executive team, consider manufacturing simpler bikes, and upend the company's capital spending strategy. https://on.wsj.com/3tODrSM
The former chief financial officer of  Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) also told the newspaper Peloton will boost spending on improving its digital interface and content options, rather than investing primarily in bikes, treadmills and other equipment.

BERLIN (Reuters) - BMW more than doubled pre-pandemic earnings in 2021 to 16 billion euros ($17.67 billion), the company said on Thursday, as higher prices and strong sales of top-end cars boosted revenue despite supply chain constraints.
The premium carmaker, which sold a record 2.52 million vehicles last year despite semiconductor shortages, reported a 10.3% earnings margin for the year, its highest since 2017.
Still, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) in its automotive segment took a 4.2% hit in the fourth quarter as the global chip shortage, which BMW has so far weathered better than competitors, caused a drop in deliveries of 14.2%.
Quarterly net profit for the group came in at 2.25 billion euros, a third higher than last year but well below 2019 levels of 5.02 billion euros.
BMW's share price tumbled 7% from yesterday's close to 70.95 euros at 1303 GMT, hitting the bottom of Germany’s bluechip index alongside Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Mercedes-Benz Group and in line with a European-wide slump in auto shares amid fears over disruptions to supplies.
French carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA), Stellantis as well as Swedish Volvo were all among the worst performers of their respective indexes on Thursday.
Premium carmakers have largely been better positioned to weather supply chain troubles than value brands because they can push higher costs onto consumers through elevated prices.
Mercedes-Benz, for example, registered a 24.7% fall in deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2021 but still boosted its EBIT by 12% in its cars and vans division.
BMW's revenues climbed 12.4% from last year to 111 billion euros, with net profit reaching a record high of 12.46 billion.
""We are in a good position and optimistic about the future,"" Chief Financial Executive Nicolas Peter said.

The company will propose a dividend of 5.8 euros per share, up from last year's 1.9 euros, it said.

Investing.com – JD.com ADRs (NASDAQ:JD) traded 7.4% lower in premarket Thursday as it posted a loss in October-December following the slowest pace of revenue growth in six quarters.
Consumer spending slowed while general expenses rose 89%, primarily due to the increase in share-based compensation. Last month, bigger rival  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) posted its slowest revenue growth for the same period since going public in 2014.
JD.com reported a net loss of 5.2 billion yuan (around $820 million) after revenue grew 23% to 276 billion yuan. It had posted a profit of over 24 billion yuan in the same period last year.
Cost of revenue jumped about 24% while market expenses surged over 28%.
Revenue at JD Retail, the unit that accounts for the bulk of the company's revenue from its website, retail partnerships and retail stores, rose nearly 21%. The logistics business saw revenue jump about 28%.
While most Chinese tech giants were facing the heat from the country’s crackdown last year, JD.com was left untouched and in fact benefited, adding new and returning brands like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and  Estee Lauder  (NYSE:EL) to its platform, according to Bloomberg.
Annual active customer accounts jumped 21% to about 570 million in 2021.
JD.com’s stock is down over 30% in the last year. It has been under pressure also because of a decision by Tencent (OTC:TCEHY), one of its early backers, to distribute its JD.com shares among its shareholders as a one-time dividend.

1310,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 07:54AM ET</span>",Nasdaq 100 Slides Into First Bear Market Since 2020,"(Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index fell into a bear market for the first time since the pandemic as investors exit risk assets following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The technology-heavy index shed as much as 3.3% by 9:31 a.m. in New York, pushing it into bear-market territory, which is measured as a decline of 20% or more for a stock index from a recent high. Russian forces attacked targets across Ukraine after President Vladimir Putin ordered an operation to demilitarize the country, prompting a threat of further “severe sanctions” on Moscow and sending markets tumbling around the world. The S&P 500 index dropped 2.4%, pushing the benchmark index deeper into a correction.
Among the Nasdaq 100’s most notable movers, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). fell 4.6%,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). dropped 2.9%, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). shed 3.2%, and Google Parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dropped 2.6%. Meta Platforms Inc. sank 2.3%; the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) parent has underperformed for months, and the day’s slide will bring it around a 50% drawdown from a September peak.
The invasion is the latest risk to hit markets, following growing expectations for a rise in interest rates and persistent inflation, factors that have largely hit high-growth names.
“We’re not at a point where you can just jump in because everything is so cheap; it is extremely hard to call a bottom, and the geopolitical risk makes it even harder,” said Ivana Delevska, chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.
The Nasdaq 100 has dropped 21% since notching its Nov. 19 closing record amid skyrocketing inflation, disappointing earnings and the prospect of conflict. Companies on the index have lost about $3.1 trillion in market capitalization so far this year as investors grapple with a double whammy for the sector in rising interest rates, which chip away at the value of future earnings, and slowing growth.
Yields have soared on the prospect that the Federal Reserve will start withdrawing the massive monetary stimulus that has supported the U.S. financial system since the pandemic hit. Policymakers are fighting the largest consumer price spikes in a generation, but investors are dumping tech and growth stocks, whose valuations ballooned during the pandemic, as borrowing costs rise. 
“Growth stocks had gotten incredibly loved and overvalued,” Eric Diton, president and managing director of The Wealth Alliance, said. “There was a feeling of intense speculation like with the tech bubble.”

Problems have been brewing since the start of the year with more than a third of the stocks in the Nasdaq 100, which represents the exchange’s largest non-financial companies, down at least 50% from their 52-week highs by just the second week of January. Meanwhile, the percentage of stocks on the Nasdaq Composite that set new 52-week highs stood at just 1% on Wednesday. 
The broader Nasdaq Composite Index also fell into bear territory, but some strategists said the selloff could have gone too far.
“The weakness in U.S. markets seems the most overdone with this move being sentiment- rather than economically-driven,” said Altaf Kassam, EMEA head of investment strategy and research at  State Street  (NYSE:STT) Global Advisors. “The moves are inspiring us to add a little risk in a measured way. However, we are tempering this addition to risk with some tail risk hedges, notably in long duration U.S. Treasuries and VIX futures.”
Wild Swings
Big Tech has experienced the wildest volatility swings in recent weeks since the pandemic shuttered the U.S. economy in 2020. At one point this month, Facebook parent Meta Platforms posted the worst one-day drop in market value in stock-market history while Amazon.com posted the biggest single-day gain in market capitalization in U.S. history.
Shares of smaller, fast-growing tech companies have been especially hurt by concerns that they would be more vulnerable to tighter monetary policy since they are more reliant on capital markets for financing rather than incredible riches that have helped some founders skyrocket to the moon. 
U.S. tech companies may face further pain as investors swap growth stocks for energy, financials and other cyclical shares that historically have benefited from improving economic growth and higher rates. The shifts likely represent a rebalancing away from the atypical conditions that have persisted for more than a decade and helped create a cadre of trillion-dollar companies dominating stock indexes.

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 07:51AM ET</span>","Analysis-Big Oil, Biden administration spar over blame for pain at the pump","By Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom
(Reuters) - The U.S. oil industry and President Joe Biden's administration are clashing over who is to blame for tight energy supplies that have driven up U.S. pump prices to record highs.
Big Oil blames the problem on Biden's tighter regulations and push for renewable energy, which it says threaten to constrain output. The White House says the U.S. drilling industry is quick to ask for concessions but slow to open the spigot when consumers need it.
""What permits do they need? I don't think they need an embroidered invitation to drill,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a press briefing on Wednesday. 
U.S. oil prices have surged in recent months due to a rebound in demand from the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and supply disruptions from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine. Even after falling sharply on Wednesday, U.S. crude settled at $108.70 a barrel, compared to about $75 at the end of 2021. [O/R]
On Tuesday, Biden banned U.S. imports from Russia, the world’s third biggest producer. Traders around the globe had already been shunning shipments from the country since it invaded Ukraine, an action Moscow calls a ""special operation.""
Retail gasoline prices in the United States spiked to a record $4.17 a gallon this week, posing a major problem for the administration as it battles inflation ahead of the November mid-term elections.
The American Petroleum Institute, which represents U.S. oil companies, took the opportunity in a press release on Tuesday to ""urge policymakers to advance American energy leadership and expand domestic production to counter Russia’s influence in global energy markets.”
“It’s time now for the administration to partner with domestic energy producers to leverage America’s ability to produce more oil and gas and focus on pro-growth policies to benefit our economy and the world’s security,” said the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a pro-business lobby group.
Oil executives this week mentioned another factor that has limited production but has nothing to do with government: pressure from shareholders to hold back spending on exploration and drilling and boost investor returns through share buybacks and dividends. 
The Biden administration has said it wants to decarbonize the nation’s economy by 2050, in part by transitioning off fossil fuels. It has sought to suspend issuing new federal oil and gas leases while it studies their climate impacts, an effort that has triggered a legal battle.
It has also said over the last few days that its policies are not hindering the oil industry’s production, noting this week that U.S. oil producers have more than 9,100 unused permits to drill on federal acres. 
Drilling permits are still being issued for federal lands, according to Interior Department records, and the pace of approvals since Biden took office is faster than it was during the administration of Republican Donald Trump. 
The administration noted that 90% of drilling takes place on private land that would be unaffected by delays in new federal leasing. It also said it wants more oil, not less.
""In this moment of crisis we need more supply,"" U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told attendees at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston on Wednesday. ""Right now we need oil and gas production to rise to meet current demand.""
Indeed, oil production in the country is on the upswing. The Energy Information Administration has projected U.S. oil production will hit a record over 12.2 million barrels per day in 2023 as drillers ramp up output.
WHERE IS THE CONSTRAINT?
The top five holders of unused leases on federal lands include EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG),  Devon Energy  (NYSE:DVN), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Matador Resources (NYSE:MTDR), according to energy research firm Rystad.
Four of the companies – EOG, Occidental, ConocoPhillips and Devon - declined to comment on whether they will raise production by tapping those unused leases. Matador did not respond to requests for comment.
EOG, the largest holder of unused permits with more than 1,000, said it's ""standard practice is to maintain a healthy inventory of the permits necessary to provide flexibility for current and future development plans."" 
Labor and supply constraints can also make it difficult for companies to boost production beyond what they had previously planned, Occidental Petroleum Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said at the CERAWeek conference. 
Occidental has more than 500 unused federal permits.
She added that oil and gas companies have been limiting costs and spending to return more cash to shareholders. ""Capital discipline today for oil companies is basically no (production) growth,"" Hollub said. 
Her view was echoed by another executive at the conference.
""As an industry, we can't lose sight of the returns,"" said ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance, and he also blamed the administration's ""poor energy policy, poor regulatory policy"" for creating the current squeeze. The company has nearly 400 unused federal permits.

For Jesse Prentice-Dunn, policy director for the Center for Western Priorities, this adds up to an oil industry dragging its feet, rather than an administration clamping down on drilling.
""The constraint is not access to public lands, it's that oil companies are prioritizing shareholders over consumers,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shell (LON:RDSa) faces writedowns on $400 million in Russian downstream assets, it said on Thursday, having announced $3 billion worth of other projects previously.
The oil major announced on Feb. 28 that it would quit its ventures in Russia with Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and related entities including the flagship Sakhalin 2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.
""It is expected that these decisions ...will impact the carrying value of the related assets and lead to recognition of impairments in 2022,"" Shell said in its annual report on Thursday.
The downstream assets come on top of $3 billion mentioned in its Feb. 28 announcement, a company spokesperson said.
Shell's production from Russian oil and gas projects reached stood at 140,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) compared with around 2.2 million boe/d total volumes for sale, according to its annual report and a spokesperson.

Shell's writedowns come amid a mass exodus of western oil majors. BP (NYSE:BP) is facing a $25 billion writedown for its planned divestment of Russian assets.
France's TotalEnergies has said it is sticking with its Russian investments.

[L5N2VD2M8]
The two billionaires and five other Russian oligarchs are the most high-profile figures to be added to the British sanctions list since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and follows criticism that Britain has acted too slowly.
Britain said they had a collective net worth of around 15 billion pounds ($19.75 billion). 
Below is the government's summary of those sanctioned and their assets: 
1. Roman Abramovich 
""Roman Abramovich has stakes in steel giant Evraz, Norilsk Nickel and owns Chelsea FC. He sold a 73% stake in Russian oil firm Sibneft to state-owned gas titan Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) for 9.87 billion pounds in 2005.
""His net worth is an estimated 9.4 billion pounds. He is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin.""
""None of our allies have yet sanctioned Abramovich.""

""Oleg Deripaska has stakes in En+ Group, a major extractives and energy company which owns UC Rusal, one of the world's major aluminium producers. He has a multi-million pound property portfolio in the UK. 
""His net worth is an estimated 2 billion pounds. The U.S. designated Deripaska in 2018.""
3. Igor Sechin 
""Igor Sechin is the chief executive of Rosneft, a Russian state oil company and particularly close and influential ally of Putin. Sechin has been sanctioned by the U.S. and EU.""
4. Andrey Kostin 
""Andrey Kostin is Chairman of VTB bank, the second largest bank in Russia. VTB Bank was designated by the UK on 24 February 2022. Kostin is a close associate of Putin, and has long supported Kremlin objectives through VTB Bank. 
""His net worth is an estimated 379 million pounds. Kostin has been sanctioned by the U.S. and EU.""
5. Alexei Miller 
""Alexei Miller is CEO of energy company Gazprom, making him one of the most important executives supporting the Russian government. Miller served under Putin in the 1990s when Putin was deputy mayor in St Petersburg. Miller has been sanctioned by the U.S..""
6. Nikolai Tokarev

1315,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 07:36AM ET</span>",Tesla’s German Bureaucracy Breakthrough Dimmed by Supply Risks,"(Bloomberg) --
Almost two years after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) started breaking ground on its factory outside Berlin, the electric-car maker finally  secured approval for the €5 billion ($5.5 billion) project underpinning its European expansion.
Authorities in the state of Brandenburg announced the green light last week after months of delays linked to environmental concerns, including water usage. If all goes as planned, the facility will be producing Model Ys for customers before the month is over. Elon Musk took to Twitter to thank local authorities, writing in German that the future is ""very exciting” and vowing to shake a leg at the plant’s opening ceremony, just as he did when Tesla inaugurated its Shanghai facility two years ago.
A celebratory dance is probably called for after successfully maneuvering through Germany’s infamous red tape. The company had to relocate hibernating bats and lizards, replant more trees than it cut down and reduce water consumption as much as possible to appease locals. The approval documents comprise more than 23,700 pages and roughly 400 conditions Tesla still has to meet to secure a production permit, including setting up emissions-monitoring equipment and introducing measures to protect local groundwater. Tesla said it expected to complete the process in around two weeks.
Musk has reason to hurry. A few hours after Tesla got final approval, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) announced it’s moving ahead with a plan to add a €2 billion EV factory close to its headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. The new plant is targeting 10 hours of production time per car — much quicker than it currently takes to piece together a vehicle at VW’s other facilities, and in line with what Tesla’s site is supposed to achieve.
VW CEO Herbert Diess replied to Musk’s tweet, saying the German giant is committed to setting new standards when it comes to quality and productivity at the factory it has code named Trinity. Peers including  Renault  (PA:RENA) and Jeep maker Stellantis also are retooling factories to make EVs.
Ramping up a new plant is always difficult. Sales of made-in-Germany Teslas may be delayed by two to three months because of pre-production issues, particularly in the paintshop, Germany’s Automobilwoche reported on Sunday. A coronavirus outbreak among workers last month also hindered progress, the weekly magazine said. Musk himself has warned of significant production risk in Gruenheide because Tesla will be trying out lots of new technology there for the first time. 
Getting enough manpower is another challenge. Tesla lists dozens of job openings for the plant on its website, and Musk this week retweeted his company’s call for applications. Around 2,500 of as many as 12,000 positions have been filled, according to local officials.
An even bigger concern than scaling production is the disruption to supply chains spurred by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The country is a major source of wire harnesses, and Russia supplies raw materials including nickel. Prices of the key metal used in EV batteries exceeded $100,000 a ton this week as an unprecedented short squeeze forced the London Metal Exchange to shut down for days. 
Supply chains to and from China also are coming under pressure because land routes through the war region are making transport increasingly difficult, Germany’s auto lobby warned last week. 
European carmakers from VW to BMW and tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) have reduced or halted output at several of their European factories. Toyota said on Wednesday it’s reviewing production plans due to mounting disruptions.
VW’s Diess fears the war could hit economies harder than Covid-19 did. The CEO is in favor of maximum sanctions against Russia, but also wants leaders to go to the negotiating table, he told the Financial Times on Thursday.
“What we don’t want is a never-ending war in Ukraine,” Diess said.

The U.S. health insurer's rebranding move is not its first, having previously changed its identity from WellPoint Inc (NYSE:ANTM) around eight years ago. 
The rebranding is a first step in the company's effort to optimize its brand portfolio, the insurer said in a statement. Anthem's Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans will not be renamed, it added.
The company, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in several states, has been attempting to compete in a changing health insurance landscape following deals by rivals such  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) to merge with the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs).
Anthem launched its in-house pharmacy benefits management business, IngenioRx, in 2019 after ending a long-standing deal with Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) Holding Co, which is now a part of Cigna.

In the quarter ended Dec. 31, IngenioRx brought in about 19% of Anthem's total operating revenue.

LONDON (Reuters) - The aviation industry needs to take ""urgent action"" to align with the world's climate goal, including curtailing growth in air travel and rapidly scaling up use of sustainable aviation fuels, a report on Thursday said.
Climate Action 100+, the world’s largest grouping of investors pushing for corporates to move faster on cutting emissions, said the actions were needed to help limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial norms.
CA100+ said it was updating its views on the sector in light of a major report from the International Energy Agency last year which suggested deep cuts in fossil fuel use would be needed to reach the mid-century target.
The CA100+ report is expected to inform discussions with company management by its 615 members, which collectively manage more than $65 trillion in assets, ahead of the next season for annual general meetings.
On sustainable aviation fuel, the report highlights the need for a ""substantial"" increase between now and 2030, citing the IEA's analysis that 16% will need to come from advanced biofuels and 2% from synthetic fuels. In 2020, use was below 0.1%.
In addition, CA100+ said business travel and long-haul leisure flights needed to be capped at 2019 levels and demand shifted to high-speed rail, where possible, in order to keep emissions at half their projected 2050 level.
Aviation firms also needed to cut their own emissions rather than use carbon offsets to compensate for them, it said.

""The industry holds its future in its own hands,"" said Ben Pincombe, Head of Stewardship for Climate Change at the UN Principles for Responsible Investment, the organisation leading the Climate Action 100+ Aviation Sector Strategy.
""If the sector fails to respond effectively, it is likely to face significant and rapid regulatory tightening, and ever greater scrutiny and challenge from capital markets.”

Investing.com – Asana, Inc. (NYSE:ASAN) stock was trading 24% lower in premarket Thursday with almost a fourth of its value erased after the company projected a slower growth in the ongoing year.
The company had a solid two-year growth when its software supporting corporate teams’ collaboration and organization proved to be a big hit in the pandemic.
Asana expects revenue of no more than $531 million in the current fiscal year, up 40% after it rose 67% in 2022.
The muted outlook comes in even as the company outperformed expectations in the fourth quarter. It closed January with over 119,000 paying customers.
The number of customers spending $5,000 or more on an annualized basis in the quarter grew 52% to 15,437. Revenue from these customers grew 82% year-over-year in the quarter.
Asana was founded in 2008 by Facebook co-founder Dustin Aaron Moskovitz and former Google and Facebook engineer Justin Rosenstein. It was listed on NYSE in September 2020. It counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Affirm Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFRM), and Sky as customers relying on it to manage digital transformation, product launches, and marketing campaigns.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's securities regulators are gathering information from futures brokerages about their clients' short positions in nickel to prevent spillover risks from rocketing prices this week, three people with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
The London Metal Exchange intervened on Tuesday to calm the nickel market after prices hit records of more than $100,000 a tonne as Western sanctions threatened supply from major producer Russia.
In China, the Shanghai Futures Exchange suspended nickel trading on Thursday after the metal surged for three days in a row. The exchange would resume trading of some of its nickel futures contracts from March 11.
As a result of the sharp price swings, local bureaus of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) have asked future brokers to submit information about how many of their clients have short nickel positions, said one of the sources.
The regulators have also asked the futures brokers in their jurisdictions to submit information about their hedging status, and whether they have nickel for delivery, the source said.
It was not immediately clear what action might be taken, if any, after those details are submitted. 
""Regulators are worried,"" because if their clients cannot meet margin calls, brokerages would need to make up for the shortfall, the second source said.
CSRC, which supervises the futures exchange, did not respond to a request for comment. 
All the sources declined to be named as they are not authorised to talk to media.
A separate source at a major futures brokerage said the firm was directly approached by the Shanghai Futures Exchange and was asked about risk-management measures, as well as about some of its big clients trading nickel and coal.
CSRC's health check on futures brokerages comes as China's banking regulators also reportedly requested lenders report overseas exposure as part of efforts to contain possible fallout from volatility in global commodity prices.
In China, ""the violent price movements of futures' contracts are likely to expose brokerage companies to losses,"" said Wang Yunfei, an analyst with ShenYin & WanGuo Futures Co, a Shanghai based futures broker.
""Losses could quickly exceed the deposits held in a broker's account if, say, prices of nickel keep surging. If a client fails to top up the deposits, while the broker fails to close the positions in time, the latter might have to bag losses.""
In the most actively traded nickel contracts, Guotai Junan Futures, Citic Futures, and Ruida Futures held the biggest short positions on Shanghai Futures Exchange, according to data on Wednesday. 
China's securities regulators have access to market data including daily trading volumes, short and long positions held by each brokerage company for a particular contract.
But they are likely trying to know more about specific betting strategies placed by major investors, as they try to take early actions and avoid concentrated bets burning brokerage companies, industry insiders said.

In developed markets, ""futures brokerages would conduct careful credibility check on clients,"" said the second source.
""In China, opening a futures account is relatively simple,"" making brokerages more vulnerable, the source added.

1320,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 06:54AM ET</span>","Pimco Stands to Lose Billions If Russia Defaults, FT Reports","(Bloomberg) -- Pacific Investment Management Co. has amassed a huge wager that Russia will not default on its debt, the Financial Times reported.
The Newport Beach, California-based asset manager has at least $1 billion of bets in the derivatives market and $1.5 billion of Russia’s sovereign debt, the newspaper reported on Thursday. At least five Pimco funds sold credit-default swaps to investors, the FT reported, citing its analysis of the asset manager’s holdings at the end of 2021. 
The positions mean it stands to lose both on its own bond holdings and on the insurance if contracts pay out. The derivatives are designed to compensate holders in the event of default.
The majority of Pimco’s swaps sit in its marquee $140 billion Income fund, run by Chief Investment Officer Dan Ivascyn, alongside Alfred Murata and Joshua Anderson, the FT reported. The fund disclosed that it had written $942 million of protection on Russia by the end of 2021. The other funds holding positions include Pimco’s Total Return bond fund, its Emerging Markets bond fund, Diversified Income and Low Duration income funds, according to the newspaper.
Credit-default swaps on Russia’s sovereign debt are trading at levels that suggest the market is expecting a high probability that the country will default on its debt. It has payments due on foreign bonds next week.
It costs $5.8 million upfront and $100,000 annually to insure $10 million of Russia’s debt for one year, suggesting a record 71% chance of default in that time, according to ICE Data Services. That compares with about $3.8 million in advance last week and about 300 basis points -- or $300,000 annually -- before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 06:21AM ET</span>",Rio Tinto slashes ties with Russian businesses over Ukraine war,"By Praveen Menon
(Reuters) -Rio Tinto on Thursday became the first major mining company to announce it was cutting all ties with Russian businesses, joining a raft of leading Western companies in a pullout following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
The global miner has previously said it has no operational assets or employees to pull out of Russia, or Ukraine, but the move comes as Western firms come under increasing pressure to exit Russia since the invasion began on Feb. 24. 
Leading U.S. companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stopped trading with Russia this week, offering a united rebuke of the war on Ukraine. Moscow describes its actions there as a ""special operation"".
""Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) is in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business,"" a Rio spokesman said in a message sent to Reuters. It wasn't immediately clear with which companies Rio has done business in Russia.
The announcement from the Anglo-Australian firm comes after a top executive said on Wednesday the company was looking for alternative fuel sources for its Mongolian copper operations at Oyu Tolgoi, but did not believe it can stop buying from Russia altogether.
The company did not immediately respond to questions on whether it would continue to buy Russian fuel and other products through non-Russian third parties.
The miner owns an 80% stake in Queensland Alumina (OTC:AWCMY) Ltd (QAL) in a joint venture with Russia's Rusal International PJSC, the world's second-largest aluminum producer. The company did not comment on how its decision to cut ties with Russian businesses would affect Queensland Alumina dealings with Rusal.
Rusal purchased its 20% stake in Australia's second-largest refinery processing alumina, the chemical compound that contains aluminium, in 2005 from Kaiser Aluminum (NASDAQ:KALU).
In 2018 Rusal was covered by U.S. sanctions against Russian businessmen and companies. Queensland Alumina was not affected by those sanctions and isn't affected so far by curbs put in place since the Ukraine invasion began.
Rio has said previously that it was actively reviewing any existing commercial ties to Russia across its global business.
Shares in Rio dropped as much as 8.3% on the Australian bourse, as they traded ex-dividend, before closing down 7.7% at A$109.91. The Sydney benchmark closed up 1.1%.

Rio rival BHP Group (NYSE:BHP) did not immediately comment on whether it had any business links with Russian firms and would consider terminating them.
Earlier, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc stopped buying oil from Russia and said it would cut links to the country entirely while the United States stepped up its campaign to punish Moscow by banning Russian oil and energy imports.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening lower Thursday after high-profile talks between Russia and Ukraine ended without progress, while investors digest volatile oil prices and await key inflation data.
At 7:15 AM ET (1215 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 290 points, or 0.9%; S&P 500 Futures traded 36 points, or 0.9%, lower; and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 160 points, or 1.2%.
The main Wall Street indices all closed sharply higher Wednesday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining over 650 points or 2%, the broad-based S&P 500 dropped 2.6%, its best day since June 2020, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6%, the biggest one-day rise since November 2020.
These gains were based on a sharp fall in oil prices, amid indications that a couple of major producers were prepared to increase output, as well as tentative hopes for peace in the Ukraine conflict.
Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov met his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey earlier Thursday, the highest profile meeting between diplomats from the two sides since Russia’s invasion, but hopes for progress toward achieving a ceasefire appear to have been dashed.
Additionally, crude prices have rebounded sharply Thursday, after they suffered their biggest one-day drop in almost two years, further weighing on sentiment.
By 7:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 4.2% higher at $113.31 a barrel, bouncing from a fall of more than 12% on Wednesday, its worst day since late November. The Brent contract rose 4.8% to $116.50, after dropping 13%, the largest one-day drop since April 2020.
Investors will also keep a close eye on U.S. inflation figures, due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which could further guide expectations for the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. The annual CPI figure for February is expected to rise to 7.9%, up from 7.5% in January. 
Weekly initial jobless claims are also slated to come out at the same time.

Russia's aviation sector is being squeezed by Western sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine, with Russia's foreign ministry warning this week that the safety of Russian passenger flights was under threat.
Agencies including Interfax quoted Valery Kudinov, a Rosaviatsia official responsible for maintaining airplane airworthiness, as saying that Russia would look for opportunities to source parts from countries including Turkey and India after a failed attempt to obtain them from China.

He also said Russian companies were registering their planes, many of which had been registered abroad, in Russia after the U.S. and European Union sanctions on aviation and that he expects some others to be returned to leasing companies.

Investing.com – Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock traded 7% higher in premarket Thursday after the company’s board approved a 20-for-1 stock split and authorized the retailer to repurchase up to $10 billion of its common stock.
The split and the proportionate share increase are subject to shareholder approval at the company’s May 25 annual shareholder meeting.
Fundamentally, a stock split does absolutely nothing to the intrinsic value of a share. At the same time, it makes it more accessible to small investors by simply reducing the value of the stock proportionately. Many retail investors base their decision on the absolute value of the share and not always its fundamental strength at that point in time.
The appeal of a split has reduced in recent times though because of the advent of platforms like Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD), which permit trading of shares in fractional quantities. The Amazon stock closed at $2,785.58 Wednesday, a price that puts it out of reach for many retail investors.
The company’s proposed $10 billion buyback replaces the previous $5 billion repurchase exercise that still had $2.88 billion left in it. The buyback doesn’t have any last date and the company isn’t obliged to buy back any share. At Amazon’s market cap of $1.42 trillion, a $10 billion buyback amounts to less than 1% of its shares."

Investing.com -- The economic damage from a prolonged war in Ukraine could be worse than that from the pandemic, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) Chief Executive Herbert Diess warned in an interview published Thursday.
“The threat of this war for Germany and Europe is huge,” Diess told the Financial Times, pointing to the risk of ""huge price increases, scarcity of energy and inflation.""
Such fears have already been reflected in a sharp drop in the euro's value since Russia invaded, as market participants bet that the hit to the economy would derail the European Central Bank's plans to normalize monetary policy as the pandemic ebbs. 
Diess's warnings come a couple of days after VW, Europe's largest carmaker, was forced to suspend production of some models in Germany, such as the Porsche Taycan, due to a shortage of components. The group usually receives supplies of electrical wiring and harnesses from Ukraine.
VW has already stopped production at its own factory in Kaluga, southwest of Moscow, and in Nizhny Novgorod. It's one of many global automotive groups to cease production in the wake of U.S. and EU financial sanctions that make the reliable import of parts to their facilities all but impossible. However, VW's Russian operations are minor compared to those in the rest of Europe, where it is the biggest private-sector employer in Germany.
Diess said that he was in favor of ""maximum sanctions"" on Russia, but also urged a quick resumption to negotiation.
""For a society like Germany, depending on Russian energy, raw materials . . . if you imagine a scenario where we cut off business relations with Russia, which we probably would have to do if this conflict (doesn't stop), you could not buy energy any more and this would lead to a situation that might impact Europe and Germany considerably,” Diess said.
His arguments echo those of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose government earlier this week refused to go along with the U.S. and U.K. in banning Russian energy imports due to the lack of short-term alternatives.
Diess's wish for negotiations got some satisfaction on Thursday as the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Russia met for talks in Turkey, the highest-level contact between the two countries since Russia invaded over two weeks ago. Newswires reported that the ministers would discuss, among other things, the possibility of a meeting between their respective presidents, which would mark an even bigger step toward a diplomatic resolution of the war."

The Manchester, northern England, based group, which sells clothing, shoes, accessories and beauty products aimed at 16 to 40-year olds, had warned on annual profit in December, blaming a spike in product return rates, disruption to international deliveries and higher inbound freight costs.
Its shares have fallen 76% over the last year as it has also sought to improve its image following negative publicity over supply chain failings.
Boohoo said on Thursday it expected to report adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for the year to Feb. 28 of about 125 million pounds ($165 million), down from 173.6 million pounds in 2020-21.
Boohoo said net sales growth in its fourth quarter was 7%, having been 10% in the third quarter.
""As expected, net sales growth in the quarter was impacted by higher returns rates year on year due to product mix. This is expected to continue in the first half of FY23,"" it said.
It said while it continued to trade well in its home market, its international performance continued to be impacted by longer customer delivery times as a result of pandemic-related supply chain pressures.
""We are confident that pandemic-related headwinds are short-term in their nature, and our focus is to ensure the business is well positioned for growth as these headwinds ease,"" said CEO John Lyttle.
Rival Zalando said last week it expected sales growth to slow in 2022.

Boohoo said last week it had suspended sales to Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Sales into Russia total less than 0.1% of group revenues.

Suzuki's Hungarian factory has suspended car exports to Russia and Ukraine as of March due to the war, the company said on Wednesday, in one of the first signs of the conflict hitting the broader economy in the region.
Central Europe is facing the economic fallout that has followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, including from harsh Western sanctions on Moscow and turmoil in global markets as investors switched into safer assets.
Suzuki said it exports about 10,000 cars to Russia and Ukraine per year and added that it was trying to shift the affected orders to other markets to maintain its planned production volumes.
Suzuki's Hungarian business sold 119,098 cars in 2020 based on the latest available figures on its website, including 101,672 vehicles in foreign markets, meaning Russia and Ukraine account for roughly a tenth of its annual exports.
""Our company has no direct Tier 1 suppliers in the areas affected,"" spokeswoman Zsuzsanna Bonnar-Csonka said, referring to Russia and Ukraine. ""However, we are continuously monitoring the entire supply chain,"" she said. She also said the global chip shortage still represented the biggest hurdle.
Bonnar-Csonka said that rising energy costs and the weakening of the forint, which is down by some 3% versus the euro this year, had an additional impact on its operations.
""We are doing our utmost to optimise our manufacturing costs. However, after a certain point, we need to reflect part of these additional costs in new car prices,"" Bonnar-Csonka said.
Other major carmakers in Hungary include Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) group's Audi division.
The sell-off across currency, bond and stock markets in Central Europe forced the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) to raise the top of its interest rate corridor by 100 basis points to 6.4% on Tuesday after the Hungarian forint sank to a record low near 400 versus the euro on Monday. read more
The NBH said the war in Ukraine boosted inflationary pressures, while risks to economic growth were on the downside.
The car sector has been a mainstay of Hungary's growth and exports, but even before the war output had been hampered by the global semiconductor shortage.

Markets have been roiled over the last couple of weeks by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with commodity prices, and oil, in particular, soaring to record levels, raising stagflation fears.

Investors are now focusing on the meeting later Thursday in Turkey between Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba, the first meeting between the two since Russia’s invasion.
These talks are taking place amid mounting fury in the West, and the potential for further sanctions, over Ukraine's accusation of Russia bombing a children’s hospital in the city of Mariupol.
Investors will also be watching the latest policy-setting meeting from the European Central Bank later Thursday, with the policymakers having to walk the tightrope caused by surging energy prices likely exacerbating already record-high inflation as well as slowing growth.
The central bank had been expected to announce the end to its emergency bond purchases, opening the way for an interest rate hike late this year. However, the high uncertainty caused by the Ukraine conflict is likely to stay in the hands of policymakers this month.

World stocks have seized on a meeting later on Thursday between the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia and are up almost half a percent. 
True, there does not seem much conviction behind the gains, with European futures only slightly higher and Wall Street so far tipped to open lower. Oil prices are trying to recover too after Wednesday's fall that was driven by the UAE holding out the possibility of more supply from the OPEC+ group.
European markets are especially on edge before a meeting of the European Central Bank, which will have to walk a thin line between committing to tackle inflation and protecting economic growth. 
Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine the ECB was on track to announce an end to money-printing stimulus and open the way for interest rate hikes. But now while the Russia-linked economic hit is worsening by the day, inflation in the bloc is more than double the 2% target, exacerbated by a weaker euro.
Aside from the ECB meeting in Frankfurt, traders will keep an eye on Versailles where a EU leaders' meeting kicks off later in the day. They will announce plans to wean the bloc off Russian energy but markets are keen to hear of any plans for additional fiscal stimulus, possibly financed by another round of joint borrowing.
Then, in the United States, February inflation is predicted at 7.8% year-on-year, surpassing January's four-decade high 7.5%. But since then U.S. gasoline prices have rocketed higher, meaning an above-forecast print may well revive bets of a 50 basis-point interest rate rise at the Federal Reserve's March 15-16 meeting.
Finally, foreign companies continue to flee Russia; miner Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), Japan's  Sony  (NYSE:SONY) and Nintendo the latest to announce their exit. All this carries a cost of course-- McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), for instance, says the temporary closure of its Russian restaurants will cost it $50 million a month. 
Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: 
-Japan's wholesale prices rise at record pace
- RICS housing survey
-ECB meeting
-U.S. CPI/initial jobless

-U.S. 30-yr bond auction
-Peru likely to raise interest rates by 50 bps

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 03:05AM ET</span>",Lessors face legal quagmire as Russian plane repos stall,"By Tim Hepher, Engen Tham and Carolyn Cohn
PARIS/SHANGHAI/LONDON (Reuters) -Global leasing companies staring at an imminent sanctions deadline to repossess more than 400 jets worth almost $10 billion from Russian airlines have received mostly radio silence as experts warn of legal wrangling that could last a decade.
Western bans imposed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine give most leasing firms until March 28 to sever ties with Russian airlines - sparking a game of cat-and-mouse from Asia to Africa as lenders frantically try to seize aircraft.
Leasing companies are terminating leases and asking for planes to be returned along with the paperwork that must be secured for planes to be placed with new airlines.
But so far, Western observers say that is not happening.
""There is nothing official, but Russian airlines are not giving aircraft back. The only ones are a handful that were already outside Russia and could be repossessed,"" said independent aviation adviser Bertrand Grabowski.
Those include two jets seized in Istanbul and Mexico City, according to trade journal ch-aviation. 
Others have wriggled through the repo net.
An Aeroflot Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 narrowly escaped being seized at the initiative of a non-Russian bank in Southeast Asia and the Gulf in the past week, two people familiar with the matter said. 
An Airbus A321neo leased to the same flag carrier was the target of a failed repossession in Egypt, aviation publication The Air Current reported.
Aeroflot did not respond to a request for comment.
MASS DEFAULT RISK
In total there are almost 780 jets leased by Russian airlines, including 515 from abroad. Even some leased within Russia are subject to claims from foreign banks.
Some 425 of these are most at risk in what looks set to become aviation's biggest mass default, according to consultants Ascend by Cirium who have seen ""virtually no progress"" in seizing jets.
For a maturing industry with portfolios worth up to $300 billion, that remains far from the global impact of the pandemic that grounded over 15,000 jets.
But the loss of a market representing 5-6% of global traffic has shocked a sector that owns more than half the world's airliner fleet. 
The resulting flood of claims and potential writedowns could trigger a lengthy contest over liability.
""This will end up in the courts forever. In general it is a very bleak picture,"" said Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of advisers Lundquist Group.
""Between the airlines, lessors and insurers, you are most probably looking at a decade of lawsuits,"" Grabowski added.
Ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) warned last week that a prolonged escalation of sanctions could pile pressure on the leasing industry, which has risen from shaky roots https://www.reuters.com/article/aviation-finance-ireland-idCNL5N0KR1EN20140119 in the 1970s to become a dominant force.
'UNCHARTED TERRITORY'
As Russia launched what it described as a ""special operation"" in Ukraine last month, some financiers reported initial signs of panic.
""Someone offered to sell me seven freighters – and two other international lessors asked if I wanted to buy their entire Russian portfolio,"" said a person at a China-based lessor, adding the offer had been refused. 
Facing multiple obstacles in seizing jets - from lack of co-operation and possible security risks on the ground, to airspace bans and questions over permission to fly to storage sites - lessors are banking on a record payout under war-risk insurance.
But the aviation insurance market will struggle to make payouts potentially dwarfing the $1.8 billion from 9/11.
A declaration of war is not necessarily required to claim under a war-risk policy, insurers say, with nationalisation, seizure and restraint under government orders also covered.
But lawyers say proving Moscow has effectively confiscated hundreds of jets could be a daunting task.
""This is totally uncharted territory. There is a possibility that insurers could cancel policies, leaving lessors with an aircraft but no insurance,"" Lundquist said.
War also threatens to erode the Cape Town Convention, an industry circuit-breaker designed to make contracts more enforceable across borders.
Its 83 nations including Russia set up an international register to smooth repossessions but it relies on co-operation widely seen as unlikely after Russian President Vladimir Putin told airline workers that Western sanctions were ""akin to a declaration of war"". 
Most lessors already use the Bermuda register rather than Russia's over legal uncertainties.
A person at a Chinese lessor with planes at Aeroflot said transferring the agreement to a different entity would require layers of approvals that have little chance of materialising.
    ""We're completely stuck,"" said the person who has spoken to an Aeroflot representative almost every day since the invasion. 
Even if conflict eases, Russia's near-isolation may permanently damage valuations by interrupting the continuity of maintenance records or encouraging airlines to swap parts.
Indirect effects might go wider still, forcing Airbus and Boeing to remarket dozens of jets and halting others' plans to convert older Russian jets into freighters amid a cargo boom.
Also in the spotlight are asset-backed securities used by lessors to ease financing and now containing high Russian risk.
All this, while soaring oil prices threaten to punch a new hole in airline balance sheets and damage the creditworthiness of all carriers. 
UK-based aviation consultancy IBA said the crisis had already delayed the industry's pandemic recovery by two months.
Critics say the crisis calls for a rethink about the way the industry handles risk. For years its selling point to investors was its ability to move assets to escape regional volatility. But a worldwide pandemic, and now a sequestered Russian fleet, have left the industry struggling to restore equilibrium.

""There was a perception that Russia was a good risk and capable of absorbing significant capacity that others could not take because of the COVID-19 crisis,"" Grabowski said.
""For people who had surplus planes on their hands Russia was a venue of last resort. Most of the market also thought Aeroflot was an impeccable credit but forgot the political risk.""

SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's securities regulator has barred the country's investment banks it regulates from acting as promoters of blank-check firms in Hong Kong, three people with knowledge of the matter said, cutting off a potentially lucrative business.
The China Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has decided to take the step, which was communicated to the mainland investment banks earlier this year, due to concerns over the risks associated with those vehicles, the sources said. 
While promoting the deals will be off-limits, the investment banks will be allowed to work as advisors on special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transactions under Hong Kong's new rules for such listings, said the sources.
The people spoke on condition of anonymity as the directive was not public.
The move comes as China is set to unveil final and tougher rules for offshore capital raising by domestic companies, as part of which the regulators are also seeking to subject investment banks to extra scrutiny. 
Mainland commercial banks-affiliated institutions, regulated by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) have been given the greenlight to be promoters, the sources said, giving them a competitive edge.
Chinese brokerages have been lobbying the CSRC to change the rules to allow them to act as promoters as well, one of the sources said.
CSRC and CBIRC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
SPACs are shell, or blank-check companies, that raise money in an initial public offering (IPO) with the proceeds held in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
In Hong Kong, promoters are the same as sponsors in other markets in that they establish the SPAC and own promoter shares issued by the blank check company.
Promoters pay much less for their shares, which are a different class of stock than those issued in the IPO, compared with the price paid by public investors, allowing them to lock in higher profits later.
Investment banks are allowed to be sponsors in the United States with some like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) having created their owns SPACs in the last two years.
In Singapore, the current rules don't bar investment banks from becoming SPAC sponsors, but bankers say the regime calls for such vehicles to be backed by experienced and quality sponsors, and is not likely to appeal to investment banks and brokerages.

In Hong Kong, the asset management arms of two commercial banks, Agricultural Bank of China (OTC:ACGBF) International (ABCI) and China Merchants Bank International (CMBI) have acted as SPAC promoters, according to exchange filings.
The city allowed creation of SPACs starting Jan. 1 and eight such vehicles have lodged preliminary filings, according to the Hong Kong stock exchange website.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 02:20AM ET</span>",Analysis - Russian risk recalibration a wake-up call for investors,"By Simon Jessop, Ross Kerber and Karin Strohecker
LONDON (Reuters) - For funds undeterred in their investment choices by the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi or China's treatment of the Uyghurs, Russia's invasion of Ukraine is proving a wake-up call.
Buying into companies on the basis of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors is one of the hottest trends in the fund management industry, attracting investments totalling more than $35 trillion by the start of 2020. 
But for money managers from Boston to London the focus has largely been on companies, with governance risk largely ignored in decisions over whether to invest in a country itself.
China has denied allegations of abuses against the Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang. Saudi Arabia's government has said Khashoggi's killing was committed by a rogue group. 
Now, as western banks and companies revisit hundreds of billions of dollars worth of exposure to Russia, more than half a dozen fund managers interviewed by Reuters said the Ukraine crisis was causing them to rethink how they assign country risk.
""We have to accept that we, as an industry, committed a very big blunder by not taking that invasion (of Crimea) in 2014 for what it was and acting accordingly,"" said Sasja Beslik, head of sustainability at Danish $87 billion pension investor PFA.
""Is this something that we would like to repeat?"" Beslik said of investors who have been left holding often distressed Russian assets since its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a ""special operation"" to disarm the country.
While a fund may make its own assessment of the quality and structure of a country's government, this is only one of many factors for investment decisions.
For some 71% of the $35 trillion invested with an ESG focus, the analysis focuses on the risk of an investment, rather than a country's human rights record or other governance factors.
It can be easier to ignore human rights if an ESG fund manager feels the chances of losing money on an asset, such as a sovereign bond, is sufficiently low given its price, because for example the relevant country's ruling government is secure.
Nicholas Lardy, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said for investment decisions on China at least western investors are more focused on shareholder value than on human rights.
However, engagement on sovereign risk is the next frontier for investors, said Martina Macpherson, president of Network for Sustainable Financial Markets, a non-profit organisation which is run by finance and academic experts.
This is particularly the case ""where systemic ESG risks such as climate, biodiversity, human rights violations and poor state governance are concerned,"" Macpherson added. 
Government clampdowns can sometimes be followed by more investment flowing into the country concerned as disruptions to daily economic activity cease, as was seen after China brought pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong two years ago to a halt.
Foreign direct investment into China rose 14.9% in 2021.
Beijing rarely discusses the issue of democracy, but has previously referred to China's governance arrangements as ""whole-process people's democracy"".
RISK REWARD
Bets on such market moves have not always been safe ones.
International investors, for example, were criticised last year for holding bonds issued by Belarus when its President Alexander Lukashenko intensified a crackdown on protesters.
And investors in a range of Chinese companies, from technology to property developers, suffered losses as Beijing unleashed a regulatory crackdown last year.
While some funds dumped investments in such countries, citing reputational and moral concerns as well as the risk of losses, these have tended to be smaller ones or those with a mandate to invest towards a sustainable outcome. 
Most have stayed, not least because the task of exiting becomes tougher the bigger the market.
The BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) iShares ESG Aware MSCI EM ETF fund, for example, has around 3% invested in Russia, but 28% in China, Refinitiv data shows.
""It's too big to ignore and it's too profitable,"" Lardy said of investor holdings in China.
This view is echoed by Ross Gerber, president of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who said China's huge global economic reach makes it hard for any investor to avoid. 
""There's no way around China,"" said Gerber, who owns shares in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), for instance, with a big factory in Shanghai.
""People criticise me for having investments in China and not Russia, but it's very nuanced, the people criticising are typing on a Chinese-made iPhone and wearing Chinese-made clothing.""
Nevertheless, some are now moving money out of China.
Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it had excluded China's Li Ning due to an ""unacceptable risk"" that the sportswear maker was contributing to serious human rights abuses in Xinjiang, China.
Li Ning did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday after the Norges Bank announcement.
SOVEREIGN RISK 
One major factor missing from ESG calculations is the market pricing of sovereign debt, said Diliana Deltcheva, head of Emerging Market Debt at asset manager Candriam's SRI Bond EM Fund, which has long excluded Russian, Belarussian, Chinese and debt from the Gulf states.
In the case of Russia, foreigners hold nearly $80 billion of debt, including sovereign bonds denominated in roubles, euros and dollars, as well as hard currency corporate securities, while investors outside Russia also owned 86% of Russia's stock market free float at the end of 2021. 
In addition, Western companies, from BP (NYSE:BP) and Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) to  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), built out ties to Russia. Many have paused or ended those connections since the invasion, steps some say show ESG values have now seeped from money management into corporate decision-making.
""There are no rules that will protect you,"" Sonia Kowal, president of U.S.-based ESG investor Zevin Asset Management, said of investing in some countries. Kowal said she avoids investments in Russia and in state-controlled Chinese firms.
Jeffrey Gitterman, an ESG-focused wealth manager in New Jersey, said he sold his firm's 5% emerging-market stake last week after Russia's invasion, worried among other things that China holdings could also face restrictions.

""Everything we know about the role of EM (emerging markets) in portfolios is now subject to re-evaluation,"" he added.

(Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has stalled a travel recovery for airlines and led to a 23% fall in flight bookings within Europe and a 13% fall in trans-Atlantic bookings in the first week, travel data firm ForwardKeys said on Thursday.
The data, which compared bookings from Feb. 24 to March 2 to the week before Russia launched what it described as a ""special operation"" in Ukraine, is an early indicator of consumer confidence for travel heading into the peak summer season.
Rising inflation and oil prices are also dampening the economic outlook and carriers including Lufthansa, Qantas Airways and Japan's ANA Holdings have warned ticket prices may need to rise to cover increased costs.
The worst-hit destinations in Europe were those in the east closest to the conflict, with Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia seeing a 30% to 50% drop in bookings, according to ForwardKeys.
Domestic bookings in Russia, which had been one of the world's top performing markets during the pandemic, fell 49%.
ForwardKeys Vice President Insights Olivier Ponti said Russia's invasion of Ukraine had stalled a recovery in bookings that began in January after cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus peaked in many countries.

But he added the impact on trans-Atlantic travel and western European destinations was so far not as bad as he had feared.
""North Americans can tell the difference between war in Ukraine and war in Europe, and so far, it seems that travellers regard the rest of Europe as relatively safe,"" Ponti said in a statement.

Investing.com - European stock markets are expected to open in a mixed fashion Thursday, as investors digest wild swings in oil prices ahead of new high-level Russia/Ukraine talks and the latest policy-setting European Central Bank meeting.
At 2:05 AM ET (0705 GMT), the DAX futures contract in Germany traded 0.4% lower, CAC 40 futures in France dropped 0.5%, while the FTSE 100 futures contract in the U.K. rose 0.5%.
European equities posted strong gains on Wednesday, with the DAX and the CAC 40 both gaining over 7%, after crude prices suffered their biggest one-day drop in almost two years amid indications major producers could increase supply to attempt to make up for the disruptions caused by the Western sanctions on Russia.
Comments from UAE's ambassador to Washington saying his country will be encouraging OPEC to consider higher output to fill the supply gap as well as reports that Iraq was prepared to increase production resulted in hefty falls in the price of crude. They have since rebounded to a certain extent.
By 2:05 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.5% higher at $110.37 a barrel, having fallen more than 12% on Wednesday, its worst day since late November. The Brent contract rose 2.7% to $114.09, after dropping 13%, the largest one-day drop since April 2020.
Markets have been roiled over the last couple of weeks by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with commodity prices, and oil in particular, soaring to record levels, raising stagflation fears.
Sentiment was also lifted with Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov set to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba in Turkey later Thursday, the first get together between the two since Russia’s invasion.
These talks are taking place amid mounting fury in the West, and the potential for further sanctions, over Ukraine's accusation of Russia bombing a children’s hospital in the city of Mariupol.
Investors will also be watching the latest policy-setting meeting from the European Central Bank later Thursday, with the policymakers having to walk the tightrope caused by surging energy prices likely exacerbating already record-high inflation as well as slowing growth.
The central bank had been expected to announce the end to its emergency bond purchases, opening the way for an interest rate hike late this year. However, the high uncertainty caused by the Ukraine conflict is likely to stay its hand this month.
In corporate news, earnings from  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) will be in the spotlight Thursday, while investors will be watching out for any more announcements over the impact of the Russian invasion on the corporate sector.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $1,986.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower at 1.1054."

LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) -France's largest bank BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) has cut off its Russia-based workforce from its internal computer systems as it seeks to bolster its defences against any potential cyber attack, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The French lender, believed to be the first major bank to have jettisoned staff in Moscow from its IT networks, has also placed employees in other locations on high alert for cyber threats emanating from Russia, following its invasion of Ukraine, an internal memo seen by Reuters showed.
The move, aimed at protecting the bank from cyber criminals who could use the local network as an access point, also further distances its shrinking Russian operations from the rest of the group. 
Banks are grappling with an unprecedented wave of Western sanctions designed to smother President Vladmir Putin's aggression by sparking domestic economic chaos, while any counter sanctions from Moscow could abruptly end lenders' relationships with one of the globe's biggest energy producers.
BNPP raised the alarm in late February after regulators, including the European Central Bank, warned of the threat of retaliatory hacking as Russia seeks to promote economic instability in countries siding with Ukraine.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the Russian state has anything to do with hacks against other countries.
BNPP employs fewer than 500 people in Russia, a fraction of its 190,000-plus global headcount, and has been gradually reducing its presence there, exiting retail banking in 2012 and consumer finance in 2020.
Moscow-based staff lost access to the bank's network last week and it is unclear when this will be restored, the source told Reuters.
A BNPP spokesperson said it was one of the ""least active"" international banks in Russia but it complied strictly with all international sanctions decided by the European Union and other governments.
""In the current geopolitical context cyber attacks are likely to multiply,"" the bank said in a series of messages sent to top staff and seen by Reuters.
""Our cybersecurity ... teams are on heightened alert ... and are extensively monitoring our networks,"" it said, adding that it had told business partners to do the same, as it assigned the hacking threat the ""highest priority"".
VULNERABILITY
The warning underscores a vulnerability of large Western banks and investment firms beyond the direct financial impact of war on business activities and asset values.
Cyber attacks can result in customers being unable to access accounts and other services and can hamper a bank's ability to trade.
BNPP outlined a 3 billion euro ($3.29 billion) exposure to Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday, while Italy's Unicredit (MI:CRDI) said a full write-off of its Russian business would cost around 7.4 billion euros.
 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Britain's Lloyds Banking Group (LON:LLOY) and Ireland's AIB Group (OTC:AIBRF) have also flagged the risk of cyber attacks since Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, which Moscow refers to as a ""special military operation"" to disarm and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis"".
Meanwhile, the Bank of England is beefing up its Cyber Security Division, with an Emerging Threat Specialist and several Senior Cyber Defence Analyst vacancies among a raft of new roles posted on its website in recent days.
The CEO of Swiss stock exchange operator SIX said on Wednesday there had been an increase in hacker attacks around the start of Russia's military operation last month.

Kyiv's cyber watchdog agency has said that Ukrainian websites have been under non-stop attack from Russian hackers since the invasion, while Meta Platforms said it had removed a network of fake accounts, groups and pages across Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram that operated from Russia and Ukraine targeting people in Ukraine.

The move comes against the backdrop of unionization efforts gaining momentum at large U.S. corporations, including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
In Buffalo, Walden Anderson, Sheridan and Bailey, and Depew stores won the vote 8-7, 15-12 and 15-12, respectively, Workers United, an affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Wednesday.
The vote saw U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders call out Starbucks to ""end union busting & embrace this movement.""
""Starbucks workers have now voted to join unions 6 out of 7 times. Union elections will soon be held in over 120 more shops. The movement to unionize Starbucks is spreading like wildfire,"" he said in a tweet.
Starbucks, which has roughly 9,000 U.S. locations, did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
In the last six months, Starbucks employees from more than 100 stores in at least 26 states have petitioned the National Labor Relations Board to hold union elections in their locations – including flagship Reserve Roastery locations in New York and Seattle.

Two other stores in Buffalo voted to unionize in December and January, and have begun negotiating contracts. Workers at a third location in the city voted down the union.
Last month, Starbucks workers in Mesa, Arizona, won their bid to join a labor union, marking the first company-owned U.S. location outside of New York state to do so.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2022 01:20AM ET</span>",Chinese startups' SPAC listings gather pace as tougher offshore IPO rules loom,"By Selena Li and Samuel Shen
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Capital-hungry smaller Chinese startups are vying for speedy offshore listings by merging with blank-check firms at a time when Beijing's tighter scrutiny has slowed capital raising via overseas IPOs, company executives and bankers said.
As a string of special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) hunt for targets to merge with, the startups see an opportunity to raise funds and get listed by cutting the time and regulatory rigour needed for traditional market debuts, they said.
The escalating Ukraine crisis, which has heightened market volatility and dampened investors' risk appetite, however, could cast a shadow over fundraising plans in the near-term.
SPACs are shell firms that raise money from institutional and retail investors via market listings, and put it in a trust for the purpose of merging with a private company and taking it public.
While Wall Street's frenzied blank-check deals have slowed in the past year due to mismatches in valuation expectations and some regulators toughening rules, competition is intensifying in Asia due to a large number of unicorn startups in the region.
""We badly need capital to help us grow,"" said Tian Rui, general manager of Nongdinghui Technology, which builds online marketplaces connecting farmers and consumers, and is eyeing a Nasdaq-listing this year by merging with a blank-check company.
""A SPAC is a very good tool to help accelerate our expansion,"" while traditional IPOs take too long, said Tian.
ETAO International Group, a digital healthcare group providing telemedicine, hospital care, pharmacy and health insurance, said in January it's going public on Nasdaq through a merger with a listed SPAC, valuing it at about $2.5 billion.
Other Chinese companies eyeing a U.S. listing through SPAC merger include solar technology startup Santime Technology and pet entertainment company Ailulu Technology, executives at the two companies told Reuters.
""The potential for it (SPAC) to be faster, and the fact that you have a little more control over the process… might make a difference in this environment,"" said Lin Xiaoxi, Hong Kong-based partner at law firm Linklaters.
Between 2019 and 2021, 10 Chinese firms raised $2 billion via mergers with U.S.-listed SPACs, according to SPAC specialist investment bank Chardan.
But last year deals ground to a halt, with only one company closing a SPAC merger as the U.S. regulator tightened scrutiny of Chinese companies' New York listings following Beijing's unprecedented crackdown on technology companies.
Regulatory tightening from both China and the U.S. have deterred some blank-check firms from merging with a Chinese company, but investors are not expected to ignore the opportunities, said Joel A. Gallo, Shanghai-based CFO at ETAO.
""This (SPAC) method of going public was chosen ... due to the ability to accelerate the listing process while reducing the costs associated with going public.""
GROWING INTEREST 
Most of the Chinese startups prefer to list in the United States via a SPAC merger due to higher valuation expectations, and more opportunities for such deals in that market. China has not yet created for a framework for onshore SPAC listings.
The growing Chinese interest comes as Hong Kong and Singapore have launched a market for SPAC listings recently, intensifying competition for deals even as Wall Street's craze for such deals is cooling.
Santime founder and CEO Harry Ze said a Nasdaq listing via a SPAC deal would propel its global strategy, while Ailulu executive Ding Jian said such a listing in the U.S. was more practical for his company.
Compared with an IPO, listing via a SPAC is also a more feasible option for a technology company with little business track record, said Zhang Yexuan, founder of a Chinese solar energy vehicle start-up which aims to list on Nasdaq next year.
While the Chinese securities regulator is yet to publish the final rules for raising capital by domestic companies overseas and it's not clear whether SPAC listings would also be subjected to tighter scrutiny, some advisors expect the door to stay open.

Drew Bernstein, U.S-based co-chairman of Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk, a China-focused international accounting firm, said he believed small companies were not a target of the new overseas capital raising rules. 
""So going after the smaller deals (in China) to be able to get things done seems to make sense,"" Bernstein said.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 10:20PM ET</span>",Explainer-Why Japan's power sector depends so much on LNG,"By Rocky Swift and Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO (Reuters) -Resource-poor Japan depends overwhelmingly on fossil-fuel imports to meet its energy needs, complicating calls for the nation to boycott Russia's oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Here's what's at stake:
WHAT'S IN JAPAN'S ENERGY MIX, AND WHY IS LNG SO IMPORTANT?
Japan gets most of its primary energy needs from crude oil, more than 90% of which comes from the Middle East, based on government data. LNG comprises about 24% of the total energy mix.
But LNG takes up a bigger piece of the pie when it comes to electricity production, at 36%. That dependence has increased since 2011, when most of Japan's nuclear facilities were idled after the massive earthquake and tsunami that triggered meltdowns at a plant in Fukushima, northern Japan. 
HOW DOES JAPAN USE LNG AND WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?
Until it was overtaken by China last year, Japan was the world's largest importer of LNG, accounting for about 22% of the total market, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The LNG supply is primarily used in electricity production, but it is also used for heating and cooking in most residential households.
Australia was the biggest single supplier of LNG at 36% of Japan's imports as of last year, followed by Malaysia with 14%. Russia accounts for 9%, the same as the United States.
COULD JAPAN REPLACE ITS RUSSIA-SOURCED LNG?
Given Russia accounts for less than 10% of Japan's LNG supply, it could probably replace that supply from other sources. But that would only compound a surge in global prices, as demand for non-Russian gas grows while supply shrinks.
Asia LNG spot prices rocketed to a record of more than $59 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) recently, compared with less than $3 per mmBtu before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Japan has more leeway with its crude oil supplies. The country's top refiners have said they would be able to find replacements in the global spot market in the event of disruptions of Russian crude as it accounts for less than 4% of their total imports.
Japan also held 480 million barrels, or 240 days' worth of oil reserves in national and private stockpiles as of December 2021. But there are only two-three weeks of LNG inventories because Japan does not have underground storage facilities, as is common in Europe, and long-term storage is not possible due to evaporation.
WHAT DO HIGHER LNG PRICES MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY AND THE BOJ?
The effect is already being felt in Japanese households in the form of surging power bills. The surging costs also add to inflationary pressures that have been compounded in Japan via supply chain disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
So far, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has ruled out tightening monetary policy to deal with those pressures.
For Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, the increase in consumer energy prices could impact the government's popularity ahead of critical Upper House elections this summer, according to Temple University political science professor James D.J. Brown.
WHAT JAPANESE FIRMS ARE INVESTED IN RUSSIAN LNG?
Trading houses Mitsui & Co and Mitsubishi Corp have stakes in the Sakhalin-2 project in eastern Russia. Mitsui also holds a stake in the $21 billion Arctic LNG 2 project, expected to be launched in 2023.
The Sakhalin Oil and Gas Development (SODECO), a consortium including Itochu Corp and Marubeni Corp, are part of the Sakhalin-1 project. In turn, the Japanese government itself has put billions of dollars into those projects in the form of loans.
CAN'T JAPAN JUST SWITCH ITS NUCLEAR REACTORS BACK ON?
Increasingly, Japan is doing just that. Power from nuclear plants slid to almost zero by 2014 in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, but now stands at about 3% of total energy production. The government wants to expand that to 20%-22% by 2030, though many market watchers believe that pace is infeasible.
Only six reactors are operating now, compared with 54 before the Fukushima disaster. Many others are still going through a re-licensing process under stricter safety standards.

Speeding up the nuclear restart could be Japan's ""best option"" to make up for fuel shortages, senior lawmaker Itsunori Onodera told Reuters on Tuesday.
In perhaps another sign of this shift, the government said this week it would forgo an official memorial of the March 11 nuclear disaster for the first time since it occurred in 2011.

This is the first stock split by Amazon since 1999 and will give investors 19 additional shares for every share they hold. Trading based on the new share price will begin on June 6.
Amazon's share split is similar to the one announced by Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc last month. Several mega cap companies such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) have split their stocks since 2020.
Amazon's stock, which closed at $2,785.58 on Wednesday, has nearly doubled over the last two years, when demand for both its e-commerce and cloud computing business surged in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""This split would give our employees more flexibility in how they manage their equity in Amazon and make the share price more accessible for people looking to invest in the company,"" an Amazon spokesperson said.

The stock buyback replaces the previous $5 billion stock repurchase authorized by Amazon's board in 2016, under which the company had repurchased $2.12 billion of its shares.
After shares declined about 16% amid a tech rout this year, the company's market capitalization stood at roughly $1.4 trillion as of last close.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were up on Thursday morning and were in tune with a rebound in global shares. Risk sentiment improved, with dip-buyers increasing bets that weeks of market volatility could have priced in the economic impact of the conflict in Ukraine.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 jumped 3.71% by 9:42 PM ET (2:42 AM GMT).
South Korea’s KOSPI rose 2.15%, with markets re-opening after Yoon Suk-yeol was elected as the country’s next president. Yoon is expected to take a hawkish stance in relations with China and North Korea.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 1.51% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rose 2.12%.
China’s Shanghai Composite was up 1.76% and the Shenzhen Component rose 2.09%.
In the U.S., contracts opened little changed after the S&P 500 recorded the sharpest gains since June 2020. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares soared more than 10% in late trading after the company announced a share split and $10 billion buyback plan. The online retailer is now a key step closer to being included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Meanwhile, a rally in many commodity markets stalled, although oil clawed back some of its steep losses overnight that saw it drop below the $110 mark. Investors also digested the United Arab Emirates (UAE)’s call for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) alliance to speed up oil production. This would be a dramatic change from the cartel’s strategy so far and could pit the UAE against its fellow members.
The market volatility that has been in place since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. led to warnings of potential stagflation. Uncertainty remains, but investor sentiment picked up Wednesday after Ihor Zhovkva, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s deputy chief of staff, indicated Ukraine is open to discussing Russia’s demand for neutrality, but with security guarantees.
“If you see a resolution of the war in Ukraine, and we are getting some reports that Russia and Ukraine might be moving closer to the negotiation stage, that could help shift sentiment,” UBS Global Wealth Management senior U.S. equity strategist Nadia Lovell told Bloomberg.
However, “we expect the market to remain choppy near term,” she said, as both the conflict and Western sanctions against Russia continue. Lovell added that she is looking for the S&P 500 to recover to 4,800 by the end of 2022 assuming no significant escalation in geopolitical stress, “given the fact that the U.S. economy’s entering this from a position of strength.”
The Russian rouble fell as trading in the currency resumed, with the impact of the sanctions remaining strong. Investors also await the European Central Bank’s latest policy decision and the U.S. consumer price index, both due later in the day.
An imminent overhaul of cryptocurrencies oversight in the U.S. is expected to provide regulatory clarity for investors. This sparked a sharp rally in digital tokens, with Bitcoin near the $42,000 mark."
1350,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 08:03PM ET</span>",Analysis-Ukraine crisis leaves European banks' renaissance in tatters,"By Lawrence White and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Europe's struggling banks entered 2022 on a wave of optimism not seen in more than a decade, with interest rates set to rise at last, the COVID-19 pandemic receding, and profits rising. The Ukraine crisis has swiftly knocked that flat.
Russia's invasion has triggered an exodus of Western companies from the country, sent commodity prices soaring, hammered the euro and even threatened a global recession, just as Europe's lenders looked poised to re-enter growth mode.
Investors had been cautiously returning to the sector, lured by cheap valuations and the prospect of excess capital set aside during the pandemic being returned as dividends and buybacks.
But capital distribution plans by Italy's UniCredit appeared to be hanging by a thread this week after it said a write-off of its Russian business would cost around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion), the starkest indication yet of how the crisis is tarnishing the sector's key appeal. 
The STOXX index of European banks has fallen 15% since the invasion on Feb. 24, against only a 5% fall in the benchmark STOXX index, making banking one of the worst performing sectors in the region.
European banks' shares trade at a discount of more than a third to their U.S. peers, RBC Europe calculations show, and could yet fall further, with valuations still above troughs seen in previous crises. 
That reflects a major change in mood in just the last few weeks. Banks' full-year earnings reports in February reflected an upbeat tone, with lenders including HSBC,  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and UBS posting bumper profits, promising more shareholder payouts and citing a much improved outlook.
Assessing the potential damage to individual banks is complicated, Eric Theoret, global macro strategist at Manulife Investment Management, said, because of the variety of ways they are exposed.
Some have holdings of Russian bonds and shares, others stakes in Russian banks, and others still sensitivity to secondary effects on Europe's economy.
""European growth will take a hit, so will European banks exposed to Russia - that's one of my biggest concerns,"" Theoret said. 
Graphic: Russia's attack on Ukraine a headwind for Europe: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/dwvkrlqogpm/banks0803.PNG 
French, Italian and Austrian banks have the most direct exposure to Russia, according to analysis by Citi.
Those with the most to lose, via their stakes in local lenders, including UniCredit and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY), could still cope with a complete write-off of those holdings, analysts said.
Societe Generale on March 3 said it could cope with being stripped of its 15 billion euro stake in local lender Rosbank.
Austrian lender Raiffeisen is looking into leaving Russia, where it is the country's tenth largest bank by assets, Reuters reported earlier this month. 
Potentially more damaging for European banks in the longer run are the risks of delayed central bank rate hikes, dwindling prospects of returning excess capital to shareholders, and the threat of stagflation, whereby prices rise as growth stalls.
Prior to the conflict, markets had priced in the European Central Bank's deposit rate rising from -50 basis points (bps) to zero by year-end. They now expect only a 20bp increase, Berenberg analyst Michael Christodoulou said.
That hurts banks because higher benchmark rates help them generate greater profits on the spread between rates charged on lending and those paid out to depositors.

A likely freeze on corporate fundraising could also hit banks, such as Barclays and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which have significant capital markets businesses.
""Debt and equity issuance by clients will be put on hold until there is greater certainty, and this could negatively impact overall revenues in underwriting,"" said Maria Rivas, senior vice president for global financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar.

Nestle, the world's biggest packaged foods group, and Mondeleze International, followed actions by rivals Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Unilever (NYSE:UL) in halting investment in Russia.
But the four companies will continue providing essentials, with Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) aiming to help to maintain ""continuity"" of the Russian food supply. 
Similarly, while cigarette maker Imperial Brands (OTC:IMBBY) suspended operations in Russia, rival Philip Morris only said it would scale down manufacturing, and Camel maker British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) Plc said its business in Russia continued to operate, even though it had suspended capital investment.
Sony, whose movie studio has already stopped releases in Russia, took additional action on Wednesday, saying its PlayStation gaming unit would stop shipments and operations in Russia. ""Sony Interactive Entertainment joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,"" it said.
Many businesses face difficulty working in Russia due to sanctions and a lack of shipping, in addition to pressure from consumers and investors, and describe ending work in Russia in more practical terms, without blaming the Russian government for attacking Ukraine.
Heavy equipment maker Deere (NYSE:DE) & Co, saying it was ""deeply saddened by the significant escalation of events in Ukraine,"" announced it had ended shipments to Russia two weeks ago, and subsequently to Belarus, and said it would follow U.S. and international sanctions.  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) said it was suspending business as supply chain disruptions and sanctions made business difficult and 3M followed suit after reassessing its business in Russia.
Still, pressure in the West is building.
A Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) executive early in the day said the miner was working to maintain supplies of Russian fuel to its Mongolian copper mine, but the company later announced it was terminating all commercial relationships with Russian businesses.
Hotel companies  Hilton Worldwide  Holdings (NYSE:HLT) and Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H) Corp said they would suspend development in Russia.
Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) halted sales in Russia on Tuesday in symbolically potent gestures. A senior member of the Russian ruling party has warned that foreign firms that close down could end up having their operations nationalised.
McDonald's said the temporary closure of its 847 stores in the country would cost it $50 million a month.
Sportswear firm Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) also quantified the cost of scaling back its operations, saying it would take a hit to sales of up to 250 million euros ($277 million). 
Yum Brands Inc, parent of fried chicken giant KFC, said it was pausing investments in Russia, a market that helped it achieve record development last year.
Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY) said it was suspending Russian brewing of its namesake brand of beer while keeping its Russian Baltika brand operating.
""We feel a moral obligation to our Russian colleagues who are an integral part of Carlsberg, and who are not responsible for the actions of the Government,"" Carlsberg said, adding it was withdrawing financial guidance for the year. 
E-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) Inc joined the crowd, saying it would suspend Russian operations and collect no fees from Ukrainian merchants, citing millions of Ukrainian refugees needing support.
'LAWS OF WAR'
In response to the exodus, Andrei Turchak, secretary of the ruling United Russia party's general council, warned Moscow might nationalise idled foreign assets.
""United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia during the special operation in Ukraine,"" Turchak wrote in a statement published on the party's website on Monday.
The statement named Finnish privately owned food companies Fazer, Valio and Paulig as the latest to announce closures.
""We will take tough retaliatory measures, acting in accordance with the laws of war,"" Turchak said.
SANCTIONS
Moscow, which calls its invasion of Ukraine a ""special military operation,"" has been hit by sweeping Western sanctions that have choked trade, led to the collapse of the rouble and further isolated the country.
Banks and billionaires have also been targeted, with the European Commission preparing new sanctions targeting additional Russian oligarchs and politicians, and three Belarusian banks, Reuters reported.
While the war in Ukraine and the sanctions have bolstered prices for commodities that Russia exports such as oil, natural gas and titanium, those sanctions have largely barred Moscow from taking advantage of the high prices.
On Tuesday the United States banned Russian oil imports.
U.S. oilfield services company Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), which derives about 5% of its revenue from Russia, said the ongoing conflict would likely hurt results this quarter.
Global commodities trader Trafigura Group raised a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility from banks to help address soaring energy and commodity prices.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday restored California's ability to set its own zero-emission vehicle sales mandate and tailpipe emissions limits, reversing a 2019 decision by then-President Donald Trump.
The agency said it was finalizing a decision to reinstate a waiver under the Clear Air Act to California that was first awarded in 2013.
""With today’s action, we reinstate an approach that for years has helped advance clean technologies and cut air pollution for people not just in California, but for the U.S. as a whole,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said.
The EPA is also rejecting a Trump-era decision to prohibit other states from adopting the California tailpipe emission standards.
California Governor Gavin Newsom said the move remedies the Trump administration's ""groundless ​attack on a critical program that is based on California's decades ​of experience setting emissions standards as authorized by law.""
The California Air Resources Board said on Tuesday it plans to significantly increase electric vehicle requirements by 2030 as the state moves to phase out the sale of gasoline-powered, light-duty vehicles by 2035.
President Joe Biden has set a goal of 50% of new-vehicle sales being electric or plug-in electric, but has not endorsed a date to phase out gasoline-vehicle sales.
In a draft document in December, the California regulator said it aimed to reach 61% of new sales as zero-emission models by 2030. A revised proposal, which is still under staff review, would aim for 68% new zero-emission vehicles in 2030, 76% in 2031, and 100% in 2035, a board spokesman told Reuters.
Sixteen states, including New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as the District of Columbia, have adopted California's tailpipe emissions rules and 13 are following its zero-emission vehicle rules.
Environmental groups praised the action.
Biden noted on Wednesday that General Motors (NYSE:GM) in November 2020 withdrew its support for Trump's effort to bar California emissions rules.
GM said Wednesday it shares California’s greenhouse gas emission ""reduction goals and vision for an all-electric future"" and would study the waiver.

In December, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration separately rescinded Trump's action seeking to bar California from setting vehicle rules conflicting with U.S. authority to set Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements.
The EPA in December finalized new vehicle emissions rules restoring targets undone by Trump and requiring a 28.3% reduction in vehicle emissions through 2026.

(Reuters) -The judge overseeing Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy on Wednesday approved a $6 billion opioid settlement funded by its Sackler family owners, overruling objections from the Department of Justice and 20 states that opposed the deal.
Under the settlement, the Sacklers would pay between $5.5 billion and $6 billion to a trust that will be used to pay the claims of states, victims of addiction, hospitals and others who have argued that the Purdue painkiller OxyContin played a central role in the U.S. opioid epidemic. 
The revised settlement must still be written into a new reorganization plan before getting final approval in bankruptcy court.
Members of the Sackler family have denied wrongdoing. They said last week in a statement that they ""sincerely regret"" that OxyContin ""unexpectedly became part of an opioid crisis.""
There have been nearly 500,000 U.S. opioid overdose deaths over two decades, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New York, called the settlement an ""extraordinary"" improvement on previous offers from the Sacklers, and he blasted the U.S Department of Justice as ""reprehensible"" for its continued opposition.
The Justice Department's Office of the U.S. Trustee, which oversees bankruptcy administration, said that the bankruptcy court does not have authority to approve the settlement because an appeals court must first decide whether the Sacklers can receive sweeping legal immunity in exchange for the payment. 
""Why are we even here?"" Justice Department attorney Nan Eitel asked at the hearing, arguing that the deal was premature.
Drain repeatedly raised his voice at Eitel, saying that the Justice Department appeared uninterested in improving the deal and was only interested in ""throwing out ways to kill it.""
""I find this reprehensible,"" Drain said. 
An attorney for Purdue's official creditors' committee said the Justice Department appeared willing to risk a multibillion-dollar settlement so that it could strengthen its argument that bankruptcy courts should not use their authority to protect non-bankrupt entities like the Sacklers.
A Justice Department spokesperson said after the hearing that the agency stands behind its attorney and her argument, and will continue its appeal.
The Sacklers' payment is contingent on ending their exposure to opioid lawsuits. But a U.S. District judge ruled in December that the protections they seek fall outside the bankruptcy court's authority. Purdue is appealing that decision in the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals.
The new agreement replaces an earlier $4.3 billion settlement, which was upended after nine attorneys general and others argued that the Sacklers should not receive such sweeping legal protections.
After agreeing to the prior deal, 20 states objected to the new settlement because it includes a $277 million payment exclusively to states that negotiated the $6 billion deal. Some have said it would unfairly reduce the percentage of funds dedicated to addressing the opioid crisis in their own states.
The states still have time to negotiate, Drain said, and may be forced to accept terms they do not like rather than inviting the ""dog eat dog"" litigation that would result if the settlement fails. 
Purdue said last week that the settlement would provide additional funding for opioid abatement programs, overdose rescue medicines and for victims, while putting the company on track to resolve its bankruptcy case on ""an expedited schedule.""
On Thursday, victims of the opioid epidemic will address members of the Sackler family in a hearing overseen by Drain. The hearing will be conducted by Zoom due to COVID-19 restrictions and the Sacklers will not be able to respond.

Purdue filed for bankruptcy in 2019 in the face of thousands of lawsuits accusing it and members of the Sackler family of igniting the opioid epidemic through deceptive marketing of OxyContin, a highly addictive pain drug.
Purdue pleaded guilty to misbranding and fraud charges related to its OxyContin marketing in 2007 and 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Wednesday it is finalizing three safety directives for some grounded Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney 4000 engines that will allow them to return to service.
The new final airworthiness directives cover Boeing 777s like a United Airlines 777 that failed shortly after takeoff from Denver in February 2021, showering debris over nearby cities. No one was injured and the plane safely returned to the airport.
The FAA said the new directives, which were proposed in December after three reported in-flight fan blade failures, require enhanced inspections and modifications that will allow Boeing 777-200 and -300 airplanes equipped with those Pratt & Whitney engines to resume flights after being grounded for more than a year.
One directive requires installing debris shields on the thrust reverser inner wall, inspecting fan cowl doors for moisture ingression and repetitive checks of the hydraulic pump shutoff valves. Another requires modifying the engine inlet to withstand fan blade failure events. A third requires specific corrective actions depending on inspection results.
The directives will be effective in mid-April.
In February 2021, the agency ordered immediate inspections of 777 planes with PW 4000 engines before further flights, after the National Transportation Safety Board found a cracked fan blade on the United engine.
United, which is the only U.S. operator of 777s with the PW4000 engine and has 52 of those planes, said the step ""is a good and safe outcome for our industry and United customers.""
The airline said ""many of the affected engines have already undergone these proposed modifications. We expect these aircraft to resume flying customers again soon.""
Boeing must now develop a service bulletin laying out steps airlines must take to meet requirements. FAA must approve that bulletin before the planes can return to service.
Boeing did not immediately comment.
In April, Japan Airlines said it had retired its fleet of 13  Boeing Co  777s with PW4000 engines a year earlier than planned, having suspended operations in February.

The Japanese carrier had an incident of its own with the PW4000 engines in December, when a malfunction forced a Tokyo-bound JAL 777 to return to Naha airport in Okinawa.
The engines are on only a small number of older 777s operated by JAL, United, ANA Holdings Inc, Korean Air Lines Co Ltd, Asiana Airlines Inc and Jin Air Co Ltd.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets rallied in Europe and North America on Wednesday after three straight days of selling, and oil prices retreated from the peaks scaled over the last week after the United Arab Emirates pledged to boost its oil supply.
Moscow accused the United States on Wednesday of declaring an economic war on Russia, and said it was considering a response to the U.S. ban on Russian oil and energy imports.
Russia's economy faces the gravest crisis since the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union after Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian companies, banks, individuals and its central banking system, following its Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine. 
But there were signs that the conflict could cool on Wednesday, as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov arrived in Turkey for more diplomatic talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, was up 2.91% on the day at 3:30 p.m. EST (2030 GMT).
U.S. stocks surged on Wednesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumping over 3%, rebounding from several days of declines as oil prices pulled back sharply and investors gauged developments in the Ukraine crisis.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 778.14 points, or 2.38%, to 33,410.78, the S&P 500 gained 123.57 points, or 2.96%, to 4,294.27 and the Nasdaq Composite added 493.33 points, or 3.86%, to 13,288.89.
Europe's STOXX 600 gained 4.68%.
In a rocky trading session, the international oil benchmark Brent crude settled 13.16% lower at $111.14. U.S. crude closed down 12.13% at $108.70 per barrel, its biggest one-day percentage decline since November 2021. [O/R]
Oil at one point fell more than 17% after OPEC member UAE said it would support boosting supply into a market in disarray because of supply disruptions and sanctions on Russia.
Joseph Capurso, head of international economics for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), noted that though Wednesday's market moves appear large, ""equities are still well below, and oil prices are still well above, prewar levels."" 
""The proximate cause for the big moves are signs Ukraine may accept Russian demands for neutrality in exchange for security guarantees,"" Capurso said. If the war does de-escalate, he said, investors will refocus their attention on inflation data and central banking moves.  
WIDESPREAD ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES
The Russian invasion and ensuing sanctions have played havoc with global supply chains, sent prices soaring across commodities markets and could slow economic growth worldwide. 
European companies are suffering more strain on supply chains caused by the war, with German carmakers Porsche, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW all curtailing output because of a lack of supplies.
The London Metal Exchange halted nickel trading on Tuesday after prices rocketed to over $100,000 a tonne on concern that Russian supplies will be interrupted. The LME said it does not expect to resume trading before Friday.
A World Bank official said high oil prices prompted by Russia's invasion could cut a full percentage point off the growth of big developing economies such as China, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkey.
Emerging market stocks lost 0.19%. 
""War is inflationary and this war in particular is very inflationary... not just in terms of energy, oil and gas, but it's inflationary across the commodities complex,"" said Dan Scott, chief investment officer at Vontobel.
""Grain prices don't react to central bank policy, and nor do necessarily nickel prices.... Hiking interest rates is not going to have a direct impact.""
After a four-session rally, spot gold fell on Wednesday by 2.4% to $2,003.66 an ounce, as markets became less risk-averse.
The European Central Bank meets on Thursday, but given the threat of stagflation - when prices soar and growth slows - economists expect rate hikes will be put off until later this year.
The euro rose on reports that European Union countries were discussing joint bond issuance to finance energy and defenee spending. The euro up 1.61% to $1.1074, while the dollar index fell 1.18%.
German government bond yields rose as investors awaited the ECB meeting.

The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was 1.9235%, as U.S. job openings, a measure of labor demand, fell by 185,000 to 11.263 million in January.
Elsewhere, bitcoin surged 9% to $42,260 after U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order requiring government agencies to assess the benefits and risks of creating a central bank digital dollar.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ) on Wednesday reported net profit of 11.1 million reais ($2.1 million) in the fourth quarter, up from a 7.7 million reais net loss a year earlier.
Quarterly net revenue came in at 7.3 billion reais, a 25% drop year-on-year. The average estimate of analysts polled by Refinitiv Eikon was 4.95 billion reais. 
The company reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 22% below the same quarter from 2020 at 609.4 million reais, while its adjusted EBITDA margin were at 8.4%, ""driven by increased operational efficiency and better prices,"" it said. 
The planemaker had already reported its delivery figures for the fourth quarter in February, when it said its firm order backlog ended 2021 at the highest level since the second quarter of 2018, making analysts call for ""solid"" quarterly results.
Embraer also provided guidance for 2022, excluding its electric aircraft subsidiary Eve, saying it expects deliveries for its commercial unit between 60 and 70 jets and executive jet deliveries in the range of 100-110 aircraft.

Its free cash flow forecast were $50 million ""or better"", while its revenues were forecasted in a range of $4.5 billion to $5.0 billion for the year.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 06:23PM ET</span>",Wall Street regulator proposes listed companies spell out cyber breaches within four days,"By Katanga Johnson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Wall Street's watchdog voted to unveil a rule on Wednesday that aims to enhance how public companies disclose when they experience a breach, and how soon.
Under the proposed Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) measures, a company would have to spell out when it experiences a risk and what strategies it has employed to address and manage such risks in current report filings, including Form 8-K.
The rule changes, which are subject to public consultation, would also require an analysis of how the cyber risks are likely to affect the company's financials. This would allow investors to assess these risks more effectively, and to locate them more readily, the SEC said.
The 3-1 vote by the commission to issue changes comes at a time of growing regulatory concern about how cyber security issues could affect markets and investors. Regulators have warned, for example, of cyber attacks from Russia in retaliation for Western sanctions.
President Joe Biden's administration has also ratcheted up its focus on the issue after a recent series of high-profile cyber attacks on U.S.-based companies.
""The interconnectedness of our networks, the use of predictive data analytics and the insatiable desire for data are only accelerating, putting our financial accounts, investments, private information at risk,"" SEC Chair Gary Gensler said on Wednesday.
""They're like honeypots sitting inside of companies and investors want to know more about how issuers are managing those growing risks.""
Wednesday's measure would also require updates in periodic reports to give investors more complete information on previously disclosed, material cybersecurity incidents, the agency said.
The proposals would build on existing SEC cyber risk guidance, which is set to remain in effect, even under the SEC's new rules, an agency official told reporters.
""How a company might think about the impact (of a breach) to management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions ... should still be taken into consideration,"" the official added.
The SEC has long warned companies that materiality of a cyber breach should not be limited to the quantitative impact on revenue or assets, but should consider qualitative factors that a reasonable investor would consider in making decisions.
Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, who dissented on the proposal, said the move goes beyond the agency's mission.
""This proposal flirts with casting us as the nation's Cybersecurity Command Center -- a role Congress didn't give us,"" she said.

Tom Quaadman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said he welcomes attention to the matter of cybersecurity risk management, but urged that the SEC liaise with other federal cyber experts to help ""ensure policies are supportive, not duplicative.""
""The SEC, as a disclosure agency, should be mindful to not get in the way of national security priorities and focus on robust coordination.""

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 06:22PM ET</span>","UniCredit, BNP Paribas detail hefty Russian exposures as markets rebound","By Valentina Za, Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) -Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) were the latest banks to set out their Russian exposures, warning of billions of euros in potential costs from the financial fallout from Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Banks, insurers and asset managers have been scrambling to distance themselves from Russia and assess their exposures after Moscow was hit with heavy sanctions by the West in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine that began last month. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”
BNP Paribas has also cut off its Russia-based workforce from its internal computer systems as it seeks to bolster its defences against any potential cyberattack, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The French lender is believed to be the first major bank to have excluded staff in Moscow from its IT networks.
 Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) said on Wednesday it is operating its Russian consumer business on a more limited basis following the country's invasion of Ukraine, while sticking with its previous plans to divest the franchise.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), meanwhile, said on Wednesday its exposure to financial markets in Russia and Ukraine was very limited. Deutsche Bank has reduced its Russian exposure and local footprint significantly since 2014, with further reductions in the past two weeks, the bank added.
The European Union agreed new sanctions against Russia and its ally Belarus on Wednesday that blacklist 14 more oligarchs and freeze relations with Belarus' central bank and three top lenders there.
Financial information provider S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) added to the growing list of companies to suspend commercial operations in Russia, a day after Britain's  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSEG) stopped some services in the country.
Italy's second-biggest bank, UniCredit, said late on Tuesday that a full write-off of its Russian business would cost it around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion).
BNP Paribas said it had a total exposure of around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) to Russia and Ukraine, which it said was relatively limited.
Shares in Europe's major financial firms have fallen sharply since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as investors took fright at some institutions' exposure to Russia and braced for a potential broader economic slowdown.
UniCredit said a worst-case scenario would knock 2 percentage points off its capital ratio, but nonetheless stuck with its dividends and share buyback plans.
Shares in UniCredit rebounded 11.68% and BNP Paribas 9.95%, with the wider STOXX index of European banks up 7.49% on the day, staging a partial rebound after recent falls. 
The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day percentage gain since June 5, 2020. 
Analysts suggested the rebound could be a temporary relief rally.
""The mood in the markets has swung around and stocks are enjoying a major rally. The fact that Western governments seem to be carrying out an economic war against Russia, rather than military conflict, has helped the overall sentiment,"" wrote David Madden, market analyst at Equiti Capital.
PULLING BACK
Europe's struggling banks entered 2022 on a wave of optimism not seen in more than a decade, but investors and analysts have warned the Ukraine crisis may have knocked that flat.
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) economists slashed their forecast for European growth on Wednesday and now expect the region to expand just 1% this year as the Ukraine crisis turbocharges commodities prices and disrupts supply chains.
Among European banks, Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) have the largest Russian exposure. 
S&P Global joined rival credit rating agencies Moody's (NYSE:MCO) and Fitch in suspending commercial operations in Russia.
The move comes as the London Stock Exchange Group suspended access in Russia to products containing news and commentary, as well as all new sales of products and services. LSEG said data products will continue to be accessible by currently serviced customers.
LSEG distributes news and commentary from Reuters as part of its products.  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), the parent of Reuters News, holds a minority stake in the LSE.
A new Russian law makes it possible to jail journalists who report any event that could discredit the Russian military.
Two of the world's largest insurers, British-based Prudential and Legal & General, said on Wednesday they each had very small exposures to Russia and no plans to increase them.
Financial firms have also been bracing for other potential risks from the war, with regulators working closely with companies to prepare defences against the threat of cyberattacks.

Swiss stock exchange operator SIX said it had seen an increase in hacker attacks around the start of the invasion but said this had since subsided.

(Reuters) - Meatless burger maker Impossible Foods sued competitor Motif Foodworks on Wednesday, accusing the startup of copying its technology for imitating the taste of real meat.
The lawsuit filed in Delaware federal court said Motif, a spinoff of biotech company Ginkgo Bioworks, infringes an Impossible Foods patent by using the protein molecule heme in its plant-based beef.
A Motif spokesperson called the lawsuit ""nothing more than a baseless attempt by Impossible Foods to stifle competition"" and said it would fight the claims.
Boston-based Motif announced last year that it had raised $226 million in its second round of investment financing. 
Wednesday's lawsuit said heme is a ""central component of meat's appeal,"" and Impossible incorporates the protein in its plant-based burger to replicate meat's taste, smell, and ""overall sensory experience.""
The lawsuit said Motif's use of an ingredient it calls ""Hemami"" in its imitation burgers infringes an Impossible Foods patent covering a ""beef replica"" product that also uses heme.

Impossible Foods asked for an undisclosed amount of money damages and a court order blocking Motif's sales of the allegedly infringing burger.
An Impossible Foods spokesperson said the company welcomes competition but does ""not tolerate attempts to undermine our brand or products"" through infringement.

(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s low-cost 5G model should enhance the iPhone maker's appeal in Asia where it is in a stiff battle with multiple rivals from Samsung (KS:005930) to Vivo, analysts believe.
After focusing on high-end phones during the pandemic-induced supply chain crisis, Apple this week unveiled 5G connectivity to its iPhone SE - for $429 - which is likely to attract more lower-end buyers in emerging markets.
""The new 3rd gen iPhone SE could be effective in gaining incremental share among price sensitive consumers, especially in Asia,"" Cowen and Company brokerage said, citing China and India in particular.
Counterpoint Research said the earlier 4G iPhone SE accounted for 12% of total iPhone sales from its launch in Q2 2020 until the end of 2021, with Japan the biggest market after the United States.
'DEMAND TO OPEN UP'
""This time we expect demand to open up more across other markets like Europe, SE (South East) Asia and Korea – regions where many consumers stayed away because of the lack of 5G support (for the older SE),"" Counterpoint Research analyst Sujeong Lim said.
The world's most valuable company with a market capitalization around $2.6 trillion, Apple achieved its highest ever market share in China at the end of last year, surpassing Huawei to become the best seller, according to a previous Counterpoint. 
Cowen and Company analyst Krish Sankar said the new small-screen 5G phone's $30 price hike from the 4G version should cover most extra costs from the enhanced technology, though margins would be lower compared to the $699 iPhone 13 mini.

He estimated the iPhone SE would generate gross margin between 42%-54%, or roughly half the gross profit for each device compared with the iPhone 13 mini.
""We believe a renewed affordable iPhone SE lineup should buoy consumer interest in iPhones versus investor fears of sharp declines,"" Citi analyst Jim Suva said.

The new four-year deal is worth around 35 million euros ($38.5 million) annually, two sources familiar with the matter said.
The agreement with the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) covers men's, women's and even esports teams. Adidas already has kit supply deals in place with national teams in countries including Germany, Spain and Argentina. 
Italy's FIGC and Adidas declined to comment on the details of the contract.
Puma, whose relationship with the Italians stretches back almost two decades, will provide their kit for the World Cup in Qatar in November, assuming the team qualifies for the competition. 
Puma said it did not want to overpay to keep the contract which one of the sources said was worth around 20 million euros per year for the Italians.

""The financials made it a poor business case and we therefore decided to not exercise our matching right,"" Puma said in a statement.

The following are some companies which have offered support:
ENERGY
TotalEnergies said on March 1 it would provide fuel to the Ukrainian authorities and aid to refugees in Europe, but stopped short of joining rivals Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) in planning to exit positions in oil-rich Russia.
COMMUNICATIONS
Ukraine said in late February it had received Starlink satellite internet terminals donated by SpaceX, though CEO Elon Musk and an internet security researcher warned these could become Russian targets.
More than a dozen telecom providers are providing free international calls to Ukraine or scrapping roaming charges there. Firms taking measures include A1 Telekom Austria (OTC:TKAGY) Group, Altice Portugal, AT&T (NYSE:T), Deutsche Telekom (OTC:DTEGY), Orange, Proximus, Swisscom, Telefonica (NYSE:TEF), Telenor, Telia Company, TIM, KPN, Vivacom and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). 
NECESSITIES
Poland's largest food retailer Biedronka said it would hire family members of its 1,800 Ukrainian employees, who would each receive a $233 grant. It has also introduced food banks collection points and pledged funds to bring food and hygiene products to refugees.
IKEA and the Ingka Foundation pledged $11 million for aid groups to bring products and services to Ukraine, while home retailer Jysk said it would give out free stock from stores it reopened in western Ukraine, and H&M said it would donate clothes and other necessities.
ACCOMMODATION
Airbnb said it was working with its hosts to offer free, short-term housing to up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine, and that it was temporarily waiving its booking fees there.
Nordic Choice offered free lodging in its Vilnius hotel, while Poland's Arche Hotels said three days after Russia launched the invasion that it had already put up 1,000 refugees as it prepared to lodge 5,000, and called for clothes, Polish language books and toy donations for children fleeing Ukraine.

(Reuters) -Walt  Disney  Co Chief Executive Bob Chapek voiced disappointment on Wednesday with a Florida bill limiting LGBTQ discussion in schools, saying he called Governor Ron DeSantis to express concern about the legislation becoming law.
Disney has been under pressure to take a public stand against the legislation that critics say will harm the lesbian, gay, transgender and queer community. The company employs more than 65,000 people at the sprawling Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) World resort in Orlando.
Chapek said Disney was ""opposed to the bill from the onset,"" but chose to work behind the scenes, relying on its longstanding relationships with lawmakers, to influence the outcome.
""I understand our original approach, no matter how well intended, didn't quite get the job done,"" Chapek said during Disney's annual shareholder meeting.
A spokesperson for DeSantis, however, said a call from Chapek on Wednesday was ""the first time we have heard from Disney"" regarding the legislation.
""The governor did take the call from Mr. Chapek. The governor’s position has not changed,"" the spokesperson said via a statement on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).
The Florida legislation, referred to by its opponents as the ""don't say gay"" bill, has stirred national controversy amid an increasingly partisan debate over what schools should teach children about race and gender. DeSantis, who is seeking re-election this year, has indicated his support for what is formally called the Parental Rights in Education bill. 
""The same Florida parents who take their families to Disney also support parental rights in education, because they do not want their children exposed to inappropriate content about sex and gender theory at school,"" the DeSantis spokesperson said.
One Disney shareholder from California read a statement from his daughter, who had been accepted into the Disney College Program in Florida, and was ""heartbroken"" that Disney failed to take a public position on Florida's legislation. 
""You can't stand on the sidelines when it comes to human rights,"" she wrote.
The Disney CEO said he had an ""extraordinary conversation"" with DeSantis, who assured Chapek that the law would not be ""weaponized in any way"" or used to harm or target gay, lesbian, non-binary or transgender kids or their families. Chapek said the governor agreed to meet with him and LGBTQ+ Disney employees to discuss concerns.
Chapek said Disney has joined some 170 companies in signing a statement from the Human Rights Commission's opposing anti-LGBTQ state legislation. The company also pledged $5 million toward organizations, including the HRC, that are working to protect LGBTQ rights.

In other matters, Disney shareholders elected all 11 board members, ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as Disney's independent public accountant and supported the compensation for the company's top executives. Investors rejected all shareholder proposals except one, which calls for the company to report on both median and adjusted pay gaps across race and gender. 
“We appreciate our shareholders’ view on this important issue, and the Board accepts the results of today’s vote,"" the company said in a statement, adding it is committed to pay equity.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canadian carriers are seeing a bounce in spring travel after a slump due to the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant, with the country's largest airport bracing for its busiest travel day since the onset of the pandemic this Friday.
But just as COVID-19 shows signs of ebbing, surging oil prices due to the Russian-Ukraine crisis and high regulatory costs are casting shadows ahead of the busy summer vacation season.
Canadian air traffic is recovering more slowly than in the United States due to tougher virus restrictions.
But after rules eased in February, flights to some sun destinations rebounded in March to levels similar to those seen before Omicron hit winter travel, data from airline data company Cirium suggest.
Toronto Pearson International Airport on Wednesday said it is expecting March 11 to be the busiest travel day since the start of the pandemic, with about 85,000 passengers set to arrive or depart ahead of spring break next week in the country's most populous-province, Ontario.
The country's two largest carriers, Air Canada and privately-held WestJet Airlines are recalling and hiring flight attendants, said Hugh Pouliot, a spokesman for the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) which represents them.
Westjet is ""hiring like mad right now.""
""We have seen an uptick in demand for both short-term (spring break) and long-term travel,"" said WestJet spokeswoman Denise Kenny.
Still, WestJet operates about 350 flights a day compared with more than 700 pre-pandemic, she noted.
""Even with this uptick we won't recover to 2019 levels,"" said Suzanne Acton-Gervais, interim president of the National Airlines Council of Canada (NACC), which represents the country's largest carriers.
Both U.S. and Canadian airlines have called for an end to testing requirements by the two countries for international travellers as they face higher oil prices and other costs.
""What we're hopeful is as the rules become less complex and more predictable people will feel comfortable traveling again,"" said Acton-Gervais who wants Canada to end testing by April 1.
The price of oil, which has climbed steadily since late last year, is linked to capacity growth, said U.S. airline trade group Airlines for America in a presentation, as some of the country's carriers cut less profitable routes. 
Air Canada and U.S. legacy carriers have said they do not have current plans to hedge.
WestJet's Kenny said other costs have risen during the pandemic with 24% of every C$100 spent on airfare in Canada going to regulatory fees.

Kenny said WestJet has not increased fares, or ""made any deliberate change to our systems in response to the rising cost of fuel.""
Air Canada said airline pricing is based on different factors including competition and demand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A proposed bill to fund the U.S. government's operations through September would cut $2 billion from a COVID-19 program to boost aviation manufacturing and repair businesses.
The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the bill on Wednesday that redirects $15.6 billion in COVID-19 relief programs to other COVID programs.
In total, the U.S. Transportation Department has offered $673 million nationwide in three rounds of awards in the $3 billion program.
The aviation manufacturing payroll subsidy program created in 2021 covers up to half of eligible companies' compensation costs for up to six months. Some major aerospace firms like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) opted not to participate.
Grantees may not conduct furloughs without employee consent or lay off workers covered by subsidies during that period.
Among the 593 awards offered were $75.5 million to Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR), $20.9 million for Connecticut-based Hexcel (NYSE:HXL) Corp, $17.5 million to BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) Controls, $12.9 million to Airbus' U.S arm, $15 million to Learjet, a unit of Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc, and $12.5 million to Dassault Falcon Jet Corp.
France's  Safran  (PA:SAF), the world's third-largest aerospace supplier, was offered about $40 million for various U.S. units.

The department said the awards will support 31,000 U.S. jobs in 43 states.
To qualify, a company must have involuntarily furloughed or laid off at least 10% of its total workforce, or experienced a decline of at least 15% in 2020 total operating revenue.

PARIS/MILAN (Reuters) - Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) took a 728 million euro ($805 million) writedown on its stake in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) in 2021, the French media group said on Wednesday, as it reported a doubling in core operating earnings over the same period.
The Paris-based company, whose top investor is billionaire Vincent Bollore, is the largest shareholder of the former Italian monopoly with a 24% stake, which reflects a total initial investment in the company of 3.9 billion euros since 2015.
Private equity firm KKR made a non-binding approach to Telecom Italia (TIM) in November which was pitched at 0.505 euro per share, valuing Italy's largest telecoms company at 10.8 billion euros.
By comparison, Vivendi's average purchase price of Telecom Italia shares was 1.07 euros each, while the company's current book value for TIM shares is 0.63 euro against 0.83 euro per share as of June 2021, according to a Reuters calculation based on available documents. 
A Vivendi spokesperson said the exact figure for the book value for TIM was 0.657 euro per share. TIM shares closed on Wednesday at 0.26 euro each. 
In a call with reporters, Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine praised the recent appointment of TIM's new boss, Pietro Labriola, and confirmed that KKR's initial approach undervalued the phone company.
""It's a turning point for Telecom Italia,"" he said. ""We consider its value very much higher than its current share price and that of the virtual value mentioned by KKR in its statement of intent."" 
Vivendi supports Labriola's turnaround plan for TIM, de Puyfontaine added. 
A TIM board meeting to draw up a response to the KKR proposal will be held on Sunday once TIM's advisers complete an analysis to compare TIM's planned in-house revamp with KKR's plan, two sources close to the matter said.
Vivendi said it also took an impairment charge of 200 million euros on its wholly-owned mobile video game-maker Gameloft, reflecting a decline of the division's performance. 
The company more than doubled its earnings before interest, tax and amortisation last year to 690 million euros thanks to strong growth at its pay-TV group Canal Plus, advertising unit Havas and publishing division Editis. 

Vivendi did not provide targets for the current year.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 04:15PM ET</span>","Australia, South Africa miners eye options as Europe makes desperate calls","By Helen Reid and Praveen Menon
(Reuters) - Australian and South African miners are exploring ways to supply coal and metals consumers in Europe scrambling for alternative sources to Russian supply, but logistics and cost constraints make it difficult to rapidly boost output, companies said. 
Prices of palladium, coal and other commodities have skyrocketed since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, while sanctions on Moscow drive Western consumers to replace Russian supply.
Customers are approaching suppliers they have no existing relationships with, desperate to secure the commodities, major producers said. Miners typically utilize long-term contracts, making surplus supply scarce. 
Palladium, used by automakers in engine exhausts to reduce emissions, hit a record high on Monday before easing back. Russia accounts for 25-30% of the world's palladium supply. 
South Africa's Sibanye-Stillwater, the world's largest primary producer of platinum, said some clients have asked about its ability to produce more platinum group metals (PGMs) but that it has very little flexibility to increase production in ""any material way"" in the short to medium term.
""Accelerating projects is possible but ... this is not a quick fix and will generally still take months or even years before the benefits are apparent,"" Sibanye said in responses to Reuters' questions. 
Automakers, who use palladium in engine exhausts to reduce emissions, will start substituting platinum for palladium if palladium prices stay high, Sibanye CEO Neal Froneman said last week.
The auto industry is expected to account for 42% of overall demand for platinum this year, up from 37% in 2021, the World Platinum Investment Council forecast on Wednesday. 
Platinum prices have also risen due to uncertainty over Russian supplies, but more mutedly as platinum is forecast to remain in oversupply this year.
South Africa's Impala Platinum (OTC:IMPUY), the world's third-largest producer of PGMs, also said it has limited capacity to plug the gap left by Russia's palladium supplies. Russia's Norilsk Nickel alone produces around 38% of global palladium and 11% of global platinum, Sibanye said. 
While miners are benefiting from the rise in metal prices, Sibanye's Froneman cautioned that supply chain disruptions could have a destructive impact on demand further down the line. 
More costly metals are also a headache for carmakers hoping to make electric vehicles more affordable. 
SHUNNING RUSSIAN COAL
Companies in Europe, which relies on Russia for 70% of its coal supplies, are also turning to Australian miners for supply of the fuel.
""Due to the conflict, we are fielding requests from Europe for security of met coal supply,"" said Gerhard Ziems, group chief financial officer of Coronado, one of the world's largest producers of metallurgical coal, used in steelmaking. 
Coronado will boost output to about 18-19 million tonnes (Mt) in 2022 from 17.4Mt last year, he said. Ziems estimated the Russia exports about 45 million metric tonnes of met coal per year. 
""In circumstances where the international community is shunning Russian coal, supply shortfalls need to be sourced from elsewhere which includes established markets such as Australia and the U.S. in which Coronado operate,"" he said.
Australia's top independent producers, Whitehaven Coal and New Hope (OTC:NHPEF) Group, said they have been approached to supply countries, including Poland, which have traditionally relied on Russian coal, and the latter said it was looking at ways to supply the European market.
""We have a mix of contracted and spot sales which allows us to take advantage of tactical opportunities in the market,"" a Whitehaven spokeswoman told Reuters.
The Australian government said last week that it would help its coal-importing Western allies to find alternatives to Russia for supplies by connecting them with local producers.
Glyn Lawcock, head of mining research at Barrenjoey, said while the idea appeared simple, the execution was not, as Australian miners were already flat out.
""It's not like people have volumes sitting there to give out. Ukraine/Russia produces high grade pellets for markets... there is no one sitting on surplus material,"" Lawcock said. 

In a sign of how tight the market is, coal prices for loading at Newcastle - the world's biggest coal port on Australia's east coast - rocketed to a record $440 a tonne last Wednesday, a five-fold jump from a year ago.
Australian Resources Minister Keith Pitt said this was an opportunity for Australian miners, and called for expansion of coal mines in the country, as these could help desperate European nations wean themselves off Russian coal.

By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Two Russian members of the supervisory board of Dutch luxury yacht maker Heesen Yachts stepped down on Wednesday, the company said, citing ""developments of the current international situation in Ukraine.""
Heesen, one of four major luxury yacht makers in the Netherlands, is owned by Morcell Ltd. of Cyprus, the investment vehicle of billionaire Lukoil president Vagit Alekperov, though its managers are Dutch.
Neither Alekperov nor the resigning board members are on international sanctions lists, though trading in Lukoil shares has been suspended.
""The current situation (leads) us to step back for the good of a company that is close to our hearts,"" Pavel Sukhoruchkin and Pavel Novoselov said in a statement.
Their resignations were first reported by Dutch investigative news site ""Follow The Money"".
Wealthy Russians are the second-largest purchasers of yachts longer than 40 meters, after Americans, according to a 2021 report by industry publication SuperYacht Times. 
Yacht-building is a significant industry in the Netherlands, with chamber of commerce records showing that Heesen, Feadship, Damen Shipyards, and Oceanco had combined sales of around 1.5 billion euros ($1.66 billion) in 2020.
The resignations at Heesen come after United States President Joe Biden said at the start of the month that the U.S. was ""joining with our European allies to find and seize (oligarchs') yachts.""
While France has seized one luxury yacht it says is linked to sanctioned Rosneft boss Igor Sechin, others such as one owned by Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in Hamburg, have become stuck or delayed in ports or shipyards due to international financial sanctions.

Reuters reported on March 3 that at least 5 yachts owned by Russian billionaires have moved to the Maldives, which has no extradition treaty with the United States.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 surged Wednesday, on hopes of a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war after Ukraine said it was open to discussing Russia’s demand for neutrality, which could prove key in ending the conflict.
The S&P 500 rose 2.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2%, or 653 points, the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.6%.
“U.S. equity markets are rallying this morning, as favorable geopolitical chatter and bargain buying work to reduce oversold chart conditions on benchmarks like the S&P 500,” Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note.
Ukraine reportedly said it was open to discussing Russia’s demand of neutrality in exchange for security guarantees.
The prospect, albeit still very nascent, of a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine crisis cooled the run-up in commodity prices including energy, and eased fears about a prolonged impact on global growth.
Technology stocks and financial stocks led the market rebound, with the latter boosted by a surge in banks as Treasury yields jumped.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) were up more than 6%.
Big tech also played a role in the broader market melt up, led by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up more than 3%, a day after the tech giant unveiled a several new products including a new updated iPhone and revamped M1 chip.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped 5% after Wedbush upgraded its rating on the streaming company to a neutral rating from underperform.
The decline in oil prices also provided a boost to fuel-sensitive sectors of the market including airlines and cruise lines.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line(NYSE:NCLH), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were up sharply.
The rebound in the broader market comes just a day ahead of an inflation report expected to show that consumer prices rose nearly 8% in the 12 months through February.
The economy, however, is expected to remain in good shape despite forecasts of slowing growth ahead as the consumer, which makes up about 66% of the economy, has shown little sign of reining in spending.
""The lack of early signs of deterioration in consumer spending like substitutions and trading down [reflects] the ability of the consumer to continue to spend money,""  Sarah Henry, portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Wednesday.

BOSTON (Reuters) -Hedge fund Third Point LLC is pushing Cano Health to put itself up for sale because the senior-care facility operator's stock price has tumbled since it went public with a blank check company.
The New York-based firm, run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, said in a regulatory filing that it now owns 6.4% of the Miami-based company, making it the third-largest investor.
Third Point, which invests $18 billion, spent $106 million to buy 11.5 million shares, the filing said.
Loeb, who has run activist campaigns at Baxter International (NYSE:BAX) and  Campbell Soup  Company (NYSE:CPB) and recently pushed  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) to make changes, said his firm is currently not looking for board seats. The filing said the firm has ""confidence"" in the company's strategy and management team.
But that could change, the filing said, if the company fails to address the ""value gap"" between its share price and intrinsic value of the company.
Cano's sluggish stock price is related to the fact that investors have ""a largely unfavorable view of companies taken public through special purpose acquisition vehicles"", Loeb wrote. He urged the company to hire bankers and lawyers to review strategic alternatives and said ""this strategic review should focus on a sale.""
Cano Health closed its merger with investor Barry Sternlicht's special purpose acquisition company in June and its stock price lost more than half of its value. On Wednesday the stock price surged 40% on news Third Point was involved, valuing the company at $3 billion.

Cano said in a statement that it is ""successfully executing its strategy"" and that the business has strong momentum, ""as demonstrated by our 115% year-over-year membership growth in 2021 and continued growth into 2022."" The company, which operates primary care medical centers in eight U.S. states and Puerto Rico, also said it welcomes shareholder perspectives.

HOUSTON (Reuters) -Rio Tinto Ltd is working to maintain steady supplies of fuel and other goods for its Mongolian copper operations from suppliers that buy from Russia and elsewhere, a top executive at the mining giant said on Wednesday. 
The Anglo-Australian company is developing Mongolia's Oyu Tolgoi, one of the world's largest known copper and gold deposits. Rio controls about two-third of the project, with Ulanbaatar controlling the rest. 
While Rio has begin looking for alternative fuel sources for Oyu Tolgoi, the company does not believe it can stop buying from Russia altogether, Bold Baatar, head of Rio's copper business, said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. Rio has supply agreements for a host of products with Mongolian suppliers, many of whom procure materials from Russia.
""The reality is, Mongolia has two very big powerful neighbors, so it's quite important for us to maintain healthy, peaceful, balanced relationships,"" Baatar said of his home country. 
Mongolia is bordered on the north by Russia and on the south and east by China, leaving Rio few options to secure supplies for the project, which is set to be the world's third-largest copper mine.
Amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, multiple companies and countries have announced they will stop business in Russia and buying Russian products. 
Baatar said it would be ""very difficult"" for Rio's Mongolian operations to stop all imports from Russia, adding that some supplies come through Russia via Kazakhstan.
""That kind of supply is fine unless the world wants to completely shut the Russian borders, which is not possible,"" he said.
Rio in January ended a long-running feud with Mongolia's government over control of Oyu Tolgoi. The deal marked a positive development for the company, which is facing major pushback for projects in Serbia, the United States and Guinea. 
Baatar appeared on a copper panel at the conference alongside Richard Adkerson, chief executive of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Inc and Trafigura's Julien Rolland. 
Baatar told the panel that it was ""pretty imperative"" for the United States to develop more copper mines to supply copper needed for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies. Rio is trying to develop the Resolution Copper project in Arizona, but has faced Native American opposition.
Mining companies ""should respect the wishes of communities, and many communities don't want to see mining,"" Baatar said. 

When asked what that meant for the Arizona project, Baatar said he believes an agreement can be reached with local Native Americans.
""I completely respect their views of the project and I'm really hopeful we can find a mutual, common solution,"" he said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - Auto industry companies need to take into account their communities and workers through greater environmental protections and higher pay in the transition to electric vehicles, a panel of investors, labor officials and human rights activists said on Wednesday.
The global auto industry is shifting to EVs in response to pressure from countries and regions like China and Europe that want to reduce carbon emissions. 
Companies also face growing pressure from investors on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) matters. Automakers not only are charging ahead on the EV rollout, but also working to ensure a supply of battery minerals.
""Every business will be significantly affected by the transition to a net-zero economy,"" Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs said at a conference held by the Council of Institutional Investors, a group of public, corporate and union employee benefit funds. 
""Companies have a responsibility to their investors ... and to their communities and their workers to prepare for this transition,"" he added. ""We can't let them bury their heads in the sand and pretend they don't need to make any changes.""
Part of that push includes good-paying jobs and access to union representation in plants, the speakers said at the event in Washington. 
Cindy Estrada, vice president of the United Auto Workers union, which represents most U.S. hourly workers at General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co and Stellantis, said the key is protecting worker jobs and wages in the EV transition.
""We could end up doing this transition and lower workplace standards,"" she said, citing the numerous EV battery plants coming online in the United States. She said the battery plant workers are expected to be paid about $17 an hour, compared with the $30-plus workers in current engine plants earn.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc CEO Elon Musk earlier this month invited the UAW to hold a vote to represent workers at the EV leader's California plant. UAW officials have not commented on the invitation, but Musk has been hostile to the union in the past.
In November, 10 advocacy groups, including Sierra Club and Greenpeace, urged EV startup Rivian Automotive Inc to engage with labor unions. Workers at Rivian's Illinois plant are not unionized.

Investors need to use their leverage with companies to ask tough questions and push for greater transparency, said Richard Kent, Amnesty International's researcher on human rights and energy transition. 
Wednesday's panel was hosted by SOC Investment Group, an adviser for union pension funds with more than $250 billion in assets. SOC pressed Rivian last fall on its battery supply chain.

In a letter to the Attorney General of the United States, the bipartisan group of lawmakers said Amazon had engaged in a ""pattern and practice of misleading conduct that suggests"" it was acting with an improper purpose to influence or obstruct the panel's investigation into competition in digital markets.
""We have no choice but to refer this matter to the Department of Justice to investigate whether Amazon and its executives obstructed Congress in violation of applicable federal law,"" stated the letter dated March 9.
In response, an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement: ""There's no factual basis for this, as demonstrated in the huge volume of information we've provided over several years of good faith cooperation with this investigation.""
A DOJ spokesperson said the department has received the letter and will review it.
The referral to the DOJ follows a previous warning from members of the U.S. committee in October 2021 accused Amazon's top executives, including founder Jeff Bezos, of either misleading Congress or possibly lying to it about Amazon's business practices. 
That letter had come days after a Reuters investigation showed that Amazon had conducted a systematic campaign of copying products and rigging search results in India to boost sales of its own brands - practices Amazon has denied engaging in.
The members had at the time stated the Reuters story and recent articles in several other news outlets ""directly contradicts the sworn testimony and representations of Amazon's top executives – including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos.""
Amazon at the time said the company and its executives ""did not mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question.""
In Wednesday's letter to the U.S. attorney general, the U.S. lawmakers cited stories from various media outlets including Reuters, the Wall Street Journal and Politico about the American e-commerce giant's business practices.
They added that Amazon had declined several opportunities to demonstrate with evidence that it had made accurate and complete representations to the panel during its investigation.
The Reuters investigation in October, which was based on a review of thousands of internal Amazon documents, showed that, at least in India, Amazon had a formal, clandestine policy of manipulating search results to favor Amazon's own products, as well as copying other sellers' goods – and that at least two senior company executives had reviewed it.

The latest letter from U.S. lawmakers cited the Reuters story, and released a letter from Amazon dated Nov. 1 in which it told five committee members that the company was ""looking into the allegations in the Reuters article,"" adding that ""doing so will take time.""
Amazon also told the U.S. panel that ""creating private brands that are similar or even identical to existing brands is a common retail practice.""

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 surged Wednesday, led by dip-buying in financials and tech on hopes of a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war after Ukraine said it was open to discussing Russia’s demand for neutrality that could prove key in ending the conflict.
The S&P 500 rose 2.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 2.1%, or 677 points, the Nasdaq Composite rose 3.5%.
“U.S. equity markets are rallying this morning, as favorable geopolitical chatter and bargain buying work to reduce oversold chart conditions on benchmarks like the S&P 500,” Janney Montgomery Scott said in a note.
Ukraine reportedly said it was open to discussing Russia’s demand of neutrality in exchange for security guarantees.
The prospect, albeit still very nascent, of a diplomatic resolution to the Russia-Ukraine crisis cooled the run-up in commodity prices including energy, and eased fears about a prolonged impact on global growth.
Technology stocks and financial stocks led the market rebound, with the latter boosted by a surge in banks as Treasury yields jumped.
 Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) were up more than 6%.
Big tech also played a role in the broader market melt up, led by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up more than 2%, a day after the tech giant unveiled a several new products including a new updated iPhone and revamped M1 chip.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped more than 7% after Wedbush upgraded its rating on the streaming company to a neutral rating from underperform.
The decline in oil prices also provided a boost to fuel-sensitive sectors of the market including airlines and cruise lines.
Carnival (NYSE:CCL), Norwegian Cruise Line(NYSE:NCLH), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) were up sharply.
The rebound in the broader market comes just a day ahead of an inflation report expected to show that consumer prices rose nearly 8% in the 12 months through February.
The economy, however, is expected to remain in good shape despite forecasts of slowing growth ahead as the consumer, which makes up about 66% of the economy, has shown little sign of reining in spending.
""The lack of early signs of deterioration in consumer spending like substitutions and trading down [reflects] the ability of the consumer to continue to spend money,""  Sarah Henry, portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management said in an interview with Investing.com on Wednesday. ""They're still willing to pay up for all of the things that they were paying for throughout the pandemic."""

1387,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 02:18PM ET</span>",Sanctioned Russians Cast $3 Billion Shadow Over PE Firm Pamplona,"(Bloomberg) -- When Pamplona Capital Management invested in Paraxel, a company that conducted clinical trials for developers of Covid-19 treatments, Russian money greased the purchase. 
When the London-based private equity firm announced its decision to buy Danish tech distributor EET Group and U.S. garden-products company BFG Supply, Russian money was behind those deals, too.
Pamplona, which raised $11 billion for five private equity funds since its 2005 inception, has marketed itself as a manager for all kinds of investors, saying as recently as last year that it caters to “a variety of clients including public pension funds, international wealth managers, multinational corporations, family offices, and funds of hedge funds.” 
But one client has stood out: LetterOne Holdings, the investment conglomerate co-founded by Mikhail Fridman, one of many Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the European Union last week following the invasion of Ukraine. Pamplona oversees almost $3 billion of LetterOne’s money, according to a LetterOne spokesman.
The sanctions are a reminder of how Russian wealth stretches far beyond Western trophy assets such as sports teams, superyachts and mansions. It helps to power the movement of food, technology and agricultural supplies. Efforts to untangle those interests from private equity investments will ripple across national economies for years to come.
Even though LetterOne is Pamplona’s biggest source of capital, the private equity firm announced Wednesday that it “has begun the process” of redeeming LetterOne’s partnership interests.

“While Pamplona has received clear guidance that LetterOne is not a sanctioned entity, the ongoing crisis in Ukraine makes such relationships increasingly challenging for our portfolio companies, their management teams, customers, employees, and counterparties throughout Europe and the rest of the world,” Pamplona said in a statement.
LetterOne said it’s disappointed by the decision.
“We sincerely wish to cooperate constructively with Pamplona and we will continue to focus on protecting the jobs our investments support while distributing the $150 million of aid we have pledged for relief for the victims of the war in Ukraine,” LetterOne said in an emailed statement.
As the sanctions began to bite and the influence of Russian money on the global economy came under greater scrutiny, Pamplona faced increasing pressure over its relationship with its most prominent backer. Lenders to the firm’s portfolio companies were reassessing those business relationships because of its ties to Russian capital, according to people familiar with the matter.
The influence of Russian money has far-reaching implications for investment firms and their backers, said MaameYaa Kwafo-Akoto, a partner at London law firm Allen & Overy.
“It is a concern for fund managers as capital that was guaranteed for portfolio investments is now out of reach,” she said. “Overnight, sanctioned lenders and investors are no longer an option.”

Fridman, 57, a native of Lviv, Ukraine, amassed a fortune by founding one of Russia’s largest private banks and collecting profits from energy ventures. In 2013, he set up Luxembourg-based LetterOne along with Petr Aven, 66, and other Russian associates to invest part of the $14 billion they took in from the sale of their stake in TNK-BP, a former state-owned company with interests in Siberian oilfields, to Rosneft Oil Co. 
The two men, who stepped down from LetterOne last week and together own less than half of the firm, said the sanctions were based on false allegations and that they plan to contest them.
“These are malicious and deliberate lies -- pure and simple, the product of historical fantasies and conspiracy theories dreamt up by individuals with their own agendas,” they said in a statement.
LetterOne also said that none of its underlying investments are affected by sanctions.
Read more: Three More Billionaires Resign From LetterOne in Ukraine Fallout
Private equity firms typically secure commitments from multiple investors and then ask for the money when they’re ready to deploy it. Clients that default on those commitments can hamper an investment firm’s ability to do deals or provide financing to help their portfolio companies grow. Several large credit funds and investment banks had shunned investing and underwriting Pamplona’s deals because of its ties to Russian money, the people said.
Much of the debt carried by Pamplona’s portfolio companies is wrapped up in leveraged loans and private credit, both of which are hard to trade, especially during a crisis. 
‘Unique Strength’
Pamplona’s Russian investors attracted scrutiny from Washington in recent years. In 2019, Pamplona sold cybersecurity company Cofense after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States pressured it to do so, citing national security risks associated with the amount of Pamplona’s foreign backing.
Pamplona was founded in 2005 by Alexander Knaster, the former chief executive officer of sanctioned Russian lender Alfa-Bank. Fridman is the co-founder and chairman of the bank’s parent, Alfa Group, one of Russia’s largest financial industrial conglomerates. His net worth has tumbled $4 billion this year to $9.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Over the years, he channeled more money to Pamplona through various investment entities. The firm’s executives, recognizing the risk of having one Russian-linked source wield so much influence, sought to raise more money to diversify its investor base, people said. Several employees have moved between Pamplona and LetterOne.
In 2012, Alfa Group said it had invested about $1.5 billion in Pamplona’s funds. Those investments eventually were rolled into LetterOne. 
The investment firm has touted its Russian heritage as “a unique strength.” 
“L1’s shareholders are used to, and comfortable with, very major changes and dislocations in their external environment,” LetterOne said in its 2015 annual report. “It is part of life for Russian investors. It is not so for Western investors.”

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 01:50PM ET</span>","GE's investors look for update on supply-chain, inflationary pressures","By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) - When  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co's investors gather on Thursday, they will focus on a potential hit to company profits from persistent supply-chain and inflationary woes.
The Boston-based industrial conglomerate last month warned that its profits would suffer in the first half of this year from supply and labor issues.
Roughly two years into the coronavirus pandemic that has snarled supply chains across the globe and driven up costs for everything from labor to raw materials, companies of all sizes are scrambling not just to produce enough to feed current demand -- but to also restock inventory shelves.
A run-up in global commodity prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine has only worsened the situation.
While GE continues to back its earnings estimates for this year, mounting concerns about supply chains and inflation have led to a 13% fall in its shares since mid-January.
In January, GE said it would return to revenue growth this year. It also expects to grow its profit margin by 150 basis points and to generate $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion in free cash flow.
The company has said it is raising prices and trying to keep a lid on costs. It is also trying to source alternative parts to help deal with shortages.
GE is expected to reiterate its full-year earnings outlook on Thursday. Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair, says Wall Street is now more focused on GE's ability to pursue profitable growth as debt reduction and cash flow have become less of a concern.
Similarly, the fallout of Western sanctions on Russia is also expected to be a topic of discussion.
Russia accounts for about 1% of GE's revenue. On Tuesday, the company said it has suspended its operations in the country and is working with authorities to ensure compliance with sanctions.
The shift in focus away from GE's balance sheet could be a relief for its investors after declining sales, crushing debt levels and operating challenges had put the company into a survival mode.
Since taking GE's reins in 2018, Chief Executive Larry Culp has primarily focused on reducing debt by selling assets and improving cash flows by streamlining operations and cutting overhead costs.
Those measures have led to an improvement in the company's balance sheet, allowing it to reduce debt by $87 billion. In a sign of growing confidence, the company's board has authorized a $3 billion share buyback program.
With its turnaround gathering steam, GE last November announced it would split into three public companies. 
It plans to spin off its healthcare business into a separate publicly traded company next year. It would combine its power and renewable energy units, and spin off that operation in 2024. Following the split, it will become an aviation company, headed by Culp.

Some analysts, however, say the timeline for the spin-offs could be brought forward. On Thursday, they expect GE to provide an update on the breakup timing.
""We believe the market under-appreciates that the timing of the three-way breakup could happen faster,"" said analysts at RBC Capital Markets in a note.

Stitch also withdrew its full-year outlook for adjusted basic operating income.
The company that uses algorithms to help customers style their wardrobe faces increasing competition, including from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
For the ongoing financial year that ends July 30, the company now expects revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year.
“This full year outlook assumes that the number of active clients is flat through the end of the fiscal year. We are actively evaluating our marketing spend as we manage improvements to onboarding and conversion,” CEO Elizabeth Spaulding said in a statement.
Net revenue in the current quarter is seen between $484 million and $500 million. Margins could be negative, according to the company.
Stitch’s revenue per active client rose around 18% to $549 across about 4 million clients. The active client base grew 4% year-on-year.
Net revenue in the second quarter rose 3% to around $517 million. Margins expanded due to tight control on selling, general and administrative expenses, and lower spending on advertising.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Amazon is expected to win unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $8.5 billion buy of U.S. movie studio MGM, people familiar with the matter said, a move that is set to ramp up competition with streaming rivals Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Disney+. 
Announced in May last year, the deal would also strengthen Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s video streaming service, drawing people to subscribe to Amazon Prime, which offers fast shipping and encourages consumers to shop more regularly.
The MGM acquisition would give the world's largest online retailer rights to James Bond, one of the most lucrative franchises in film history that's earned nearly $7 billion at the box office globally, according to MGM.
MGM also licences content for video games, which could benefit Amazon's development efforts in that area.
The European Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by March 15, declined to comment.

Amazon said: ""Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and we’re working with regulators to respond to requests.""
The Federal Trade Commission is nearing a mid-March deadline to decide on the deal, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Investing.com -- Piedmont Lithium Ltd ADR (NASDAQ:PLL) has completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for a proposed second lithium hydroxide plant.
The company plans to expand its U.S. manufacturing capacity to 60,000 metric tons per year of lithium hydroxide.  
They believe they will be able to achieve that target using spodumene concentrate secured under existing supply agreements with Sayona Mining and Atlantic Lithium, and other sources. Spodumene concentrate is used to produce lithium chemicals that go into electric vehicle batteries.
The company said the PEA assumes the lithium hydroxide plant is located at one of the several sites under consideration and also that there is a 30-year life of operations with the production of 30,000 metric tons per year of battery-grade lithium hydroxide.
Projected capital costs for the plant are $572 million. Based on those capital cost assumptions, the PEA projected an estimated net present value of approximately $2.25 billion and an internal rate of return of 33%.
“2021 was a transformative year for electrification in the United States,” said Piedmont President and CEO Keith Phillips. 
“Current and forecasted battery manufacturing capacity now exceeds 500 gigawatt-hours (“GWh”) with public announcements of over $25 billion in capital investments to occur by 2025. The potential lithium volume these battery plants will require reinforces the importance of developing a domestic lithium supply chain,"" Phillips added.
The potential site development still remains subject to various factors, including a final site selection and financing. 
Piedmont shares rose 6% Wednesday.

""I expect that it will be around a dozen aircraft in Switzerland,"" a spokesperson for the Federal Office of Civil Aviation said. This included EuroAirport near Basel, which straddles the Swiss-French border. 
There were two aircraft in Geneva, including an Aeroflot passenger jet, and none in Zurich, he said, adding that not all airports had responded to his survey.
Swiss broadcaster SRF said its investigation had found private aircraft believed to belong to Russian oligarchs were on the ground at EuroAirport.
It said one of the aircraft was believed to belong to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, and had flown to Basel from London at the end of February. Another was thought to belong to billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, it said.
Neither could be reached for immediate comment on the report. The airport declined comment.
Switzerland adopted European Union sanctions against Russia and closed its airspace to Russian aircraft and airlines on Feb. 28.
Abramovich and Vekselberg are not personally sanctioned in Switzerland but would still be affected by the airspace closure.

Russia's super-rich oligarchs have been the focus of Western pressure following the invasion of Ukraine, due to their links to the Kremlin.
Moscow says its actions are a ""special operation"" aimed at disarming Ukraine and removing leaders it casts as dangerous.

(Reuters) - Packaged food maker  Campbell Soup  (NYSE:CPB) Co posted below-expectation quarterly sales on Wednesday but forecast better profit margins for the second half of 2022 thanks to easing supply chain constraints and a fuller workforce.
Shares of Camden, New Jersey-based Campbell rose as much as 4% to $43.98 after it also maintained full-year profit targets largely above expectations.
The COVID-19 pandemic ripped through supply chains across the food industry, raising costs, delaying deliveries and reducing worker numbers in the United States.
However, Campbell Chief Executive Mark Clouse predicted margins would recover through the rest of the year on improved staffing including 3,500 new workers in the last seven months.
""We now see absenteeism and vacancy rates trending back to normal levels. This is translating to more production and the beginning of a return to normal distribution and inventory levels,"" he said.
HOME COOKING TREND
Higher prices, and a sustaining of the home cooking boom, have helped rivals including Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), Kellogg (NYSE:K) and Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) deliver above-expectation topline results in recent months.
Campbell - known for Swanson broth, Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies - said benefits from recent price changes will be reflected in the current quarter with improved profits coming despite higher inflation than previously expected.
The company maintained its full-year adjusted earnings forecast of between $2.75 and $2.85 per share, saying roughly 95% of costs for fiscal 2022 were ""fairly well covered."" That compares to analysts' estimate of $2.79, according to Refinitiv IBES.

In the quarter to Jan. 30, however, Campbell's gross margin fell to 30.3% from 34.4% the previous year due to higher supply expenses and the labor crunch, while organic sales were down 2%.
Net sales dropped a bigger-than-expected 3%, while per-share profit of 69 cents came in line with estimates.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) -Prudential PLC notched up a 16% rise in 2021 operating profit after it strengthened its focus on Asia, though it warned of implications for global markets and the economy from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Uncertainties triggered by the crisis in Ukraine have prompted insurers to review their risk exposure. Prudential's investment exposure through its Eastspring asset management unit is minimal, chief financial officer Mark FitzPatrick told a media call.
However group chief executive Mike Wells warned, ""The current conflict in Ukraine could have wider implications for global economic and market conditions as well as geopolitical relations.""
Prudential now has no operations in Europe following the spin-off of British and European business M&G in 2019.
Its adjusted operating profit came in at $3.23 billion, up from $2.75 billion in 2020, beating the $3.19 billion consensus of analysts' forecasts provided by the company.
Prudential's shares surged 5%, outperforming the FTSE 100.
Prudential entered 2022 with an improved balance sheet, with a $2.4 billion equity raise in Hong Kong in the fourth quarter, used to repay debts.
Mainland China became Prudential's largest market for sales for the first time last year, Wells told reporters.
The company is “exploring” a regional partnership in China’s Greater Bay Area in the wealth management space, Prudential Asia CEO Nic Nicandrou told Reuters separately.
New business in Hong Kong, Prudential's Asia headquarters, however, continued to face pressure from the extended mainland China border closure in 2021 and from COVID-19. 
Wells retires at the end of this month and Prudential's incoming chief executive will be based in Asia but may start outside Hong Kong, as the financial hub grapples with a surging COVID-19 pandemic.

The results are the life insurer's first after two strategic demergers that left Prudential focusing on Asian and African markets.
Following the M&G spin-off, it offloaded its U.S. business Jackson last September.

At the end of January, the company’s order backlog was higher by 60% at nearly $18 billion on strong demand for its recreational vehicles as people return to enjoying their lives after two years of the pandemic. Additionally, backlog fell while consolidated RV wholesale shipments rose more than 14%.
The company said it is looking to reduce its order backlog “without overproducing and overloading our independent dealer channel” even as it sees strong retail demand for its products. Thor showcased two new electric RVs at the 2022 Florida RV SuperShow and said the feedback “has been phenomenal”. Thor said it is focused on growth and higher profitability.
Gross margin in the second quarter rose 2.2 percentage points to 17.4% due to lower discounts and higher product prices that helped offset inflation in raw materials, the company said.
Consolidated net sales in the quarter jumped over 42% to $3.9 billion, partly due to the acquisitions the company made last year.
The addition of the Tiffin Group, acquired in December 2020, accounted for over $132 million of the increase in net sales while the inclusion of Airxcel, acquired in September 2021, contributed about $129 million.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Curtiss-Wright (NYSE:CW) Corp on Wednesday settled a week-old proxy fight with Saddle Point Management LP after the investment firm argued that the defense company lacked strategic focus and that some non-core industrial businesses should be divested.
The New York-based investment firm, which owns approximately 0.3% of the Davidson, North Carolina-headquartered maker of defense and intelligence programs, agreed to withdraw its four nominees to the board, Curtiss-Wright said in a statement.
Saddle Point's slate included national defense and financial industry experts.
Curtiss-Wright's chief executive officer, Lynn Bamford, said in the statement that the company is ""open minded"" about shareholders' ideas and will continue to look for directors who ""bring to bear the critical skills and values in light of our business, financial profile and our portfolio's increasing focus on defense.""
Saddle Point, which is run by former Pershing Square Capital Management partner Roy Katzovicz, has been engaging with Curtiss-Wright since 2020 and has urged the company to become a more pure play defense company.
In its proxy statement released last week, Curtiss-Wright, which is valued at $5.7 billion, said its portfolio ""will continue to reflect an increasing percentage of defense, as evidenced by six of the last seven acquisitions ... as well as our recent divestitures of non-defense businesses.""

Washington, D.C.-based Carlyle is attempting to grow its credit investment platform and take on peers Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) Inc and Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Inc. 
Carlyle in 2016 hired veteran credit executive Mark Jenkins from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) to spearhead its expansion into the private credit market.

TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp agreed on Wednesday that its union demand for annual salary and bonus hikes will be fully met in the new fiscal year, President Akio Toyoda said.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor and Honda Motor followed suit with the same response to its union's demands after Toyota's announcement, in a sign of broadening momentum towards wage hikes needed to stoke a virtuous cycle of wage growth and private demand.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has urged profitable Japanese firms to raise pay by 3% or more to help achieve his ""new capitalism"" agenda aimed at boosting wealth distribution.
""I'd like to thank all those unionists who did the utmost for the future of the auto industry despite uncertainty on the outlook amid the coronavirus and a chip shortage,"" a Toyota labour union official quoted the president as telling a meeting between labour and management.
""We will pay salary and bonuses in line with their demands,"" he added, confirming the union's demand was fully met during the third round of the talks for 2022.
Neither Toyota nor Nissan unveiled the extent of pay hikes immediately. Honda offered a base pay rise for the first time in two years, Kyodo news agency reported.
The decisions at the three major Japanese automakers were made during the annual labour talks at blue-chip companies a week before they are concluded on March 16.
Toyota, the largest auto maker, has long served as a pace-setter for annual wage talks, which is followed by not just the auto sector but other industries, including smaller enterprises.

Last year, major Japanese companies offered the lowest pay hikes in eight years, pushing the pace of increase below 2% as the COVID-19 outbreak dealt a blow to profits at many firms.
Although analysts expect wages to rebound in the coming fiscal year, the pace of growth will be modest as resurgence of infections and Russia's aggression in Ukraine cloud the outlook.

Morningstar's data is based on the top 100 global funds and ETFs based on their dollar exposure to Russian bonds and equities. The list contained 71 equity funds and 19 bond funds.
The Invesco Developing Markets A and Harding Loevner Institutional Emerging Markets I, which had about 8% exposure to Russian equities as of December, faced outflows worth $347.6 million and $221.6 million respectively.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator asked a judge for permission to distribute $40 million to investors it obtained in a 2018 civil settlement with Elon Musk and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc that resolved a fraud charge and required Musk to obtain advance approval for some tweets.
Musk's lawyers had accused the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month of having ""broken its promises"" by dragging its feet on the payout, while trying to muzzle their client's speech and harass him with an ""endless"" investigation into his conduct.
The SEC did not mention the dispute in a Tuesday night court filing describing what it called a ""fair and reasonable"" means to distribute the payout, which has grown to $41.2 million with interest, that deserves ""significant deference.""
Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, declined to comment on Wednesday.
Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million civil fines, and Musk stepped down as Tesla's chairman, to resolve SEC claims that Musk defrauded investors on Aug. 7, 2018, by tweeting that he had ""funding secured"" to take his electric car company private.
A related consent decree also required Musk to obtain pre-clearance from Tesla lawyers for tweets and other public statements that could be material to Tesla.
Musk believes the SEC has since ""weaponized"" the decree to stifle his speech as punishment for his criticism of the government.
On Tuesday, he formally requested to end the decree, adding that he felt pressured to accept it.
""I never lied to shareholders,"" Musk said in a court filing. ""I entered into the consent decree for the survival of Tesla, for the sake of its shareholders.""
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan enforces the decree and would need to approve the distribution plan.

Payouts would go to investors who lost money in Tesla stock in the 1-1/2 days after Musk's tweet.
The SEC filed the proposed plan 10 hours after Musk asked to scrap the consent decree.
The cases are SEC v Musk, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-08865; and SEC v Tesla Inc in the same court, No. 18-08947."

Net sales in the quarter ended January 30 fell 3% to $2.2 billion on lower volumes, offset by higher prices. President and CEO Mark Clouse attributed this to a “difficult comparison” and other factors, including labor and supply constraints, made tougher by the Omicron surge.
Sales in the same quarter a year ago rose, owing to a jump in at-home food consumption during the pandemic.
Organic net sales, which exclude the impact from the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business, fell 2%, the company said.
“However, heading into the second half of the fiscal year, we are seeing labor availability and service levels improve, better mitigation of inflation with pricing, and strong levels of demand all underpinning our confidence in our delivery of full-year guidance,” he said in a statement.
The company is expecting the second half to be better as price hikes come into effect fully while supply and labor conditions improve.
Campbell expects its current year sales to be flat or to fall 2% in the worst-case scenario. Organic net sales could rise by 1% or fall as much, according to the company’s estimates. Adjusted profit per share for full-year 2022 is seen flat or falling by a maximum 4%.

Pachter pointed to the company's recent sell-off as a reason for the upgrade, telling investors in a note that it “reflects that Netflix investors have begun to appreciate that the company’s long-term prognosis is as a low growth, extremely profitable enterprise.”
He did, however, add that he doesn't expect a “significant share price appreciation in the near-term.” 
“Netflix’s first mover advantage and large subscriber base provides the company with a nearly insurmountable competitive advantage over its streaming peers. Netflix appears to have hit a ceiling on subscribers in UCAN, and is pulling new levers to lower churn,"" the analyst stated, reiterating previous comments from January.
Adding that ""subscription price increases should fuel additional content production and growth in other regions.”
While Wedbush believes content dumps will keep customer churn high, Pachter feels Netflix is aware of the situation after the company split the Stranger Things series into two half-seasons. 
He concluded that Netflix will ""deliver sustainable profit growth as long as it is able to continue raising subscription prices, but competition may create a price ceiling.""
After a sell-off that has seen it fall 43% in 2022, Netflix is trading 3.8% higher Wednesday."

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Africa's largest mobile operator by subscribers, MTN Group, resumed annual dividends on Wednesday, declaring a higher payout than previous guidance as a divestment plan made progress and the firm reported higher profit. 
Last year March MTN suspended dividends to focus on reducing debt and because of uncertainty around cash upstreaming from Nigeria, the timing of proceeds from its asset realisation programme and the impact of COVID.
It said at the time it would announce a revised medium-term dividend policy in March 2022 and anticipated paying a total ordinary dividend of at least 260 cents per share for fiscal 2021. 
""The board has looked at the cash balances, solvency and liquidity as well as the investment profile that we have in the year ahead and has declared a dividend of 300 cents per share, so 40 cents higher than our minimum,"" said Group Chief Executive Ralph Mupita.
It also announced a new dividend policy, to guide the market annually on a dividend amount, subject to its capital allocation priorities and market conditions, Mupita added.
With its new policy, MTN anticipates paying a minimum ordinary final dividend of 330 cents for financial year 2022.
By 0900 GMT, shares were up 5.40% at 196.71 rand.
MTN, with 273 million customers in 19 countries across Africa and the Middle East, also gave new higher medium-term guidance, with group service revenue now projected at mid-teens percentage growth in constant currency terms, upgraded from low-to-mid teens.
MTN Nigeria, its biggest revenue generator, is forecast to produce service revenue growth of at least 20% from previous mid-teens target. 
Its financial results for the year ended Dec. 31 showed group service revenue grew by 18.3% to 171.8 billion rand ($11 billion), ahead of its medium-term targets, thanks to continued demand for data, digital and financial services.
It increased headline earnings per share (HEPS), the main profit measure in its home market of South Africa, by 31.8% to 987 cents.

Holding company net debt fell to 30.1 billion rand from 43.3 billion rand due to cash received from its operating companies as well as proceeds from its divestment plan.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy has ruled that state broadcaster RAI should retain a stake of at least 30% in its towers unit Rai Way, a draft government decree seen by Reuters showed on Wednesday.
Reuters reported on Monday that Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi had signed off on a decree allowing RAI to cut its 65% holding in Rai Way below 51%, in a move expected to trigger sector consolidation.
The decree could pave the way for merger talks between Rai Way and rival EI Towers, a long-mooted tie-up that would create a group worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in the television and radio mast sector.
RAI can cut its stake in Rai Way ""up to the limit of 30%"" while ""keeping control over such a strategic infrastructure"", the decree said, adding the towers firm should remain listed.
Shares in Rai Way were up 2.2% at 1233 GMT, after closing up 5.86% on Tuesday.
Intesa San Paolo analysts said in a report that the 30% threshold ""should not prevent a consolidation with EI Towers and its potential in terms of synergies"".
Banca Akros estimated EI Towers has approximately 600 million euros more net debt than Rai Way, adding this meant that in a merger of equals between the two tower groups, RAI would remain ""well in excess"" of the new 30% limit. 
The decree lists ways RAI can offload the holding, including ""one or more extraordinary merger deals"", a direct negotiation or a public offer, without setting a deadline for any of the options.
Rome is reversing a provision made in 2014, when Italy ruled that at least 51% of Rai Way should remain in public ownership due to the strategic importance of its infrastructure.
EI Towers launched a takeover bid for Rai Way in 2015, but this was thwarted by the centre-left coalition government of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
At that time, former conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's family controlled EI Towers through broadcaster Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY) and Renzi did not want to see the media magnate take control of Rai Way's assets.

EI Towers is now 60% controlled by fund F2i and 40% owned by MediaForEurope, Mediaset's new name.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Makers of everyday staples from Pampers diapers to Dove soap are walking a fine line by continuing to sell their products in Russia, as pressure grows on multinational companies to take a stand against Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine.
McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) said on Tuesday it was closing its restaurants in Russia, including its iconic Pushkin Square location in Moscow. PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) also stopped sales of their best-known products in Russia. 
But the world's biggest makers of packaged food items and household basics have lagged some financial services firms, oil and gas companies and retailers that withdrew entirely from Russia. The consumer products companies argue that everyday people in Russia rely on their products. 
Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) Co and Unilever (NYSE:UL) Plc said this week they are continuing to sell essential products in Russia, but are ending any new capital investments and are no longer advertising in the country. Unilever has suspended all imports and exports of products into and out of the country.
On Wednesday, Nestle, the world's largest food group, followed suit, suspending investment in the country after its earlier decision to stop advertising there.
Dairy company Danone SA (OTC:DANOY) is taking a similar approach.
""I give them credit for doing more today than they did yesterday,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who is tracking major companies' moves to withdraw from Russia. ""The more comprehensive the pullout, the more you’re advancing the prospects of world peace.""
Sonnenfeld added that it was a ""mistake"" to try to minimize the damage to Russian people by continuing to supply basics. 
""There's no middle ground,"" he said. 
Cadbury chocolate maker  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB), which produces Huggies diapers, have yet to announce plans to curtail production in Russia. 
“It’s not about pure profits,” said Katie Denis, a spokeswoman for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group representing companies including P&G and Mondelez. “It’s about, are you going to continue producing things people need? It’s different than what companies who came out earlier are dealing with.”
WORTH THE RISK?
Companies also do not want to be seen as harming regular Russian citizens by putting them out of work.
At least six major fast-food companies – including Yum Brands Inc's KFC and Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR)'s Burger King – run more than 2,500 restaurants in Russia, mostly through franchisees, and employ tens of thousands more people, according to a Reuters tally that does not include McDonald's. 
Yum on Tuesday said it was suspending operations of its 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in the country and finalising an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut restaurant operations, in partnership with its master franchisee.
But other companies have so far remained silent.
Investors such as the New York State pension fund want companies to consider whether continuing to do business in Russia is worth the risks.
Asset manager Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) is pressing companies in phone calls and letters to be ""open and transparent about what they do in Russia"" and share ""what decision-making process they've gone through to come up with a conclusion"" on working in the country, said Hannah Shoesmith, director of engagement at the firm. Federated Hermes is targeting consumer products companies in its outreach, Shoesmith said.
""We wouldn't ask companies to just leave Russia without asking them to assess the impact on human rights,"" Shoesmith said. ""There's a tradeoff companies have to make. It's not so black and white."" 
Companies also ""should start to think carefully"" about their position on taxes paid to the Russian government, Shoesmith said.
""There are attempts to come up with good solutions around paying tax,"" she said. ""If they pay tax in Russia, what are the solutions they can come up with to make up the balance on that?""
Shoesmith said that in prior military coups and refugee crises, companies made payments equivalent to their tax bills to nongovernmental organizations aimed at helping people. 
'CORPORATE SUICIDE' 
""There's a big move in our industry to focus on companies with strong corporate governance and ethical standards - and that means societal issues as well,"" said Jack Martin, investment manager at Oberon Investments, which holds shares in Unilever,  Diageo  (LON:DGE) Plc, Burberry Group (OTC:BURBY) Plc and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (OTC:LVMUY). ""It's corporate suicide, really, at the moment, to not pull back from the region."" 
Joe Sinha, chief marketing officer for Parnassus Investments in San Francisco, said his firm has no direct exposure to Russian companies, but that it is reaching out to the U.S. portfolio companies it owns with more than 2% or so of revenue exposure to Russia to ask for details about their thinking on whether to stay or leave the country.

""We’re not being prescriptive, we’re trying to understand their roles and choices,” Sinha said. While Parnassus is supportive of steps like sanctions that cut off Russian banks and technology firms close to the military, he said, the analysis could be different for food companies that serve consumers. 
“For certain goods and services it would harm individual citizens who don’t have anything to do with the regime,” he said. “There are gray areas.”

TOKYO (Reuters) -Japanese airline operator ANA Holdings Inc will only raise airfares as a last resort to cover European route changes, its incoming chief executive said on Wednesday, adding that it would focus on belt-tightening first.
Koji Shibata, who takes the helm of the parent company of All Nippon Airways (ANA) from April 1, also told Reuters in an interview that the crisis in Ukraine was so far having a limited impact on earnings, as the airline had already scaled back international flights due to COVID-19.
His comments are the latest to illustrate corporate Japan's drive to avoid price increases, despite the spiking cost of fuel and commodities. Years of deflation have made Japanese consumers ultra-sensitive to price hikes and forced companies to avoid increasing prices - prolonging the economic malaise.
""We will do everything we can"" to avoid price hikes as a result of the change of European routes, Shibata said. 
""But we may be in a situation where we will have to slightly increase air fares to make up for the amount we cannot cover by cost-cutting."" 
ANA, like other airlines around the world, changed its routes over Europe following Russia's invasion. The political turmoil raised uncertainties and jacked up oil prices.
Shibata, though, said the energy price's surge has limited impact thanks to hedging for domestic and surcharges for international flights. 

Airlines are also reeling from the collapse of international travel triggered by the COVID pandemic. 
It would take about two years for the demand for international flights to return to the pre-pandemic level depending on how Japan's COVID-related entry restrictions, which is gradually relaxed, and the Ukraine crisis will unfold.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Wednesday on a change in the messaging from Russia and Ukraine that suggested they may be inching toward a negotiated settlement after two weeks of war. 
Russia's Foreign Ministry dropped what had appeared to be a key element of its war objectives as Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Moscow doesn't want to occupy Ukraine or overthrow its government. Later, Ihor Zhovkva, deputy chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said that the country was willing to discuss adopting neutral status in return for security guarantees, something that would make the issue of Ukraine joining NATO a moot point. 
By 9:33 AM ET (1433 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 580 points, or 1.8% at 33,213 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.5%.
The improvement in risk appetite was also immediately evident in oil prices, which fell over 5% to their lowest since last Friday. U.S. Crude futures were quoted at $117.50 a barrel, while Brent was at $121.50, a day after U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. will ban imports of Russian energy, forcing U.S. buyers to find alternatives on the open market.
Despite all this, the fighting in Ukraine continued unabated, punctuated again by mutual accusations of violating the ceasefires that had been agreed to allow civilians to escape from besieged cities. Unverified social media footage indicated widespread use of cluster bombs and 'butterfly mines' by Russian forces against the fleeing population. Nor was there any sign of movement on the key issue of territory, with Russia continuing to demand that Ukraine recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the independence of two breakaway republics in eastern Ukraine that it established eight years ago after its first invasion. Zhovkva said Ukraine ""won't cede one inch of territory.""
Elsewhere, Russia's government approved a draft bill that would allow it to nationalize the assets closed by Western companies that have ceased or suspended operations in the country due to the war. In the last 36 hours, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) have joined that list, as have Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP). 
Early moves essentially reversed the pattern of trading seen in recent sessions, with growth and financial stocks rising and oil and gas stocks falling. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock rose 2.1% after it held a preview for a new generation of high-end desktops and a revamped iPhone SE, its cheapest smartphone offering. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock meanwhile rose 2.3%, shrugging off concerns about the explosive rise in prices for nickel, a key battery metal.
Oil majors by contrast gave up some of their windfall gains.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 2.8%, while  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock fell 1.8% and Occidental (NYSE:OXY) stock fell 0.7%. 
Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) stock rose 10% after the White House issued an executive order on digital currencies that appeared to allow a regular pathway into the financial mainstream for them.
Elsewhere, Macy’s (NYSE:M) stock rose 4.8% after the struggling department store chain refinanced high-yielding debt at a lower rate, a vote of confidence by creditors in its viability, while  Bumble  (NASDAQ:BMBL) stock rose 40% after the female-led dating site published quarterly numbers that eased fears about its future."

The rally in U.S. hours follows a volatile day in Asia for shares listed in Hong Kong and China. Rising inflation, heightened tensions between the U.S. and China and the exclusion of a firm from Norway’s sovereign wealth fund have added to investors’ worries. The Hang Seng Index and CSI 300 Index saw intraday declines of 3% or more before an afternoon surge cut the losses to less than 1% by the close.
The intraday rebound “has led to speculation that the Chinese authorities moved in to support their stock market,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. “This has given traders the kind of confidence they need to buy the Chinese ADRs for at least a short-term trade.”
Wild Ride in China Stocks Triggers Memories of 2018 Meltdown

Any sustained momentum for Chinese stocks would be a welcome change for U.S. shareholders.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 08:12AM ET</span>","For BP's CEO, Russian exit eased by reservations about Rosneft stake","By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) - Within hours of Moscow launching its invasion of Ukraine, BP’s chief executive summoned his senior team to discuss the limited options for its Russian operations, including separating the British energy giant’s stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft or exiting completely, according to three senior BP (NYSE:BP) executives.
Bernard Looney made it clear at the Feb. 24 meeting that he saw the investment as untenable, the executives said. The decision, which marked a reversal of BP's three decades-long relationship with Russia, was made easier by reservations Looney had about the Rosneft stake. Looney had become increasingly uncomfortable with BP PLC’s nearly 20% stake in the Kremlin’s state oil champion, according to the three BP executives and another person close to Looney, despite publicly defending the investment.
The chief executive has staked his future on a bet that BP can make the transition to clean energy much faster than its peers, moving away from the company’s 112-year history in oil. Rosneft’s strategy, by contrast, is to keep pumping oil for as long as there is demand for the fossil fuel.
""Rosneft was dissonant with our strategy,"" said one of the three BP executives, who was familiar with the Feb. 24 meeting. The speed at which Looney, a 51-year old Irishman, moved to exit Russia reflects what was a clear-cut decision for him, the three executives said.
Looney had privately expressed his concern about Rosneft’s place in BP’s strategy to other top executives, according to a second of the BP executives plus the person close to Looney. The Rosneft investment had become a liability for BP because of Russia’s growing political isolation since 2014 but Looney didn’t know who to sell it to, said two western oil executive familiar with BP’s leadership thinking.
Within three days of Looney’s summoning his team, BP announced it was abandoning its Rosneft stake at a cost of up to $25 billion, becoming the first major Western company to pull out. The rapid retreat represents a dramatic exit for BP, one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia, wiping out half of BP's oil and gas reserves, a third of its production and almost $1 billion in annual dividend.
The move put pressure on other oil majors, with London-based Shell (LON:RDSa) PLC and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) of the United States quickly following suit by quitting multi-billion dollar investments in Russia. Those decisions will be harder to execute because both companies operate large projects in Russia; BP is a passive shareholder in Rosneft, although it has a joint oilfields project with the Russian firm. 
The exit by Western firms adds to energy market uncertainties and disruptions. With gas and oil at or near record levels, analysts predict a further spike in inflation and a possible economic recession in the West in the coming months and a deep recession in Russia.
Other Western companies have since said they’re exiting business activities or putting them on hold as a result of the invasion, which Moscow calls a “special operation” to demilitarize Ukraine and capture what it says are dangerous nationalists.
""There was only one decision we could make,” the first senior BP executive said. “The exit was the only viable way.” 
Speaking at an energy conference in Houston Tuesday, Looney said the decision to leave Russia was the ""right thing.""
In response to Reuters questions for this article, BP referred to the company’s Feb. 27 statement. The situation in Ukraine “caused us to fundamentally rethink BP’s position with Rosneft,” Looney said in the statement.
The Russian company, whose full name is NK Rosneft' PAO, didn't respond to a request for comment. Rosneft has said it regretted BP's departure and that BP came under unprecedented political pressure from ""regulators and shareholders"" to quit the partnership, without elaborating.
On Feb. 28, the European Union imposed sanctions on Rosneft’s CEO, Igor Sechin. The EU described the former deputy Russian prime minister as one a close advisor and personal friend of President Vladimir Putin. France last week impounded a luxury yacht - the 88-metre (190-foot) Amore Vero, or True Love in Italian - which it linked to Sechin.
Rosneft has said Sechin was unaware that any company linked to him owned the yacht. Sechin, who couldn’t be reached for comment, has in the past accused the West of using energy as a political weapon.
The day after Looney’s management meeting, Britain’s business secretary expressed concern to the BP CEO over the energy company’s large interests in Russia. In response to Reuters questions about whether the British government pressed BP to exit the stake, a government spokesperson said: “While this is ultimately a commercial matter, we welcome the growing number of organisations and governments” joining international efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically and financially.
BP has said it didn't come under political pressure.
STRAINED RELATIONSHIP
By contrast with Looney, his predecessor Bob Dudley stood by the stake when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and sought to act as a bridge between Moscow and the West. Dudley had spent several years of his career in Russia. He sought to prevent Western sanctions imposed at the time from impacting BP and used his personal relationship with President Putin and Sechin to broker diplomatic talks between Western and Russian leaders.
BP had entered Russian oil production soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It bought a stake in a small Russian producer in 1998 and through a series of deals came to own 19.75% of the Russian company in 2013. For Rosneft, the partnership with BP gave it access to international financial markets and constituted an important link for the Kremlin with the West.
In an early sign of his hesitation about the stake, Looney didn’t take a seat on Rosneft’s board until four months after becoming BP CEO in February 2020. Meanwhile, Dudley stayed on Rosneft’s board, where he remained until last month.
""Unlike with Bob (Dudley), there was nothing that connected Bernard to Russia,” said the second BP executive. “He never worked in Russia, he never drank with Sechin.""
Dudley didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Looney’s relationship with Sechin has been strained at times, according to the person close to Looney and the two western oil executives. According to one of those executives, when Looney announced plans to dramatically cut BP’s oil output by 2030 as part of its clean-energy transition, Sechin said in a private meeting with other Western oil executives that Looney was destroying everything Dudley had built.
Looney felt he and Dudley lacked sway over Sechin to influence Rosneft’s development to bring it more in line with BP’s, according to two of the three senior BP executives. BP urged Rosneft over the past two years to outline a strategy to reduce its own carbon emissions, which helped prompt the Kremlin-controlled company to publish targets to reduce emissions from its operations to net zero by 2050 at the end of last year.
The targets, however, fell far short of BP's climate ambitions. Rosneft targets focused on emissions from extracting oil and gas and did not include the much larger emissions from fuels sold to customers.
Still, Rosneft generated profits for BP. During a February 2021 call with investors, Looney highlighted that Rosneft had been a good financial investment, noting BP had received $4 billion in dividends since 2013.
Under its transition strategy, BP has said it would retain the most profitable oil and gas operations, designating them as resilient hydrocarbons, to fund the transition.
""It felt like we could hold on to the Rosneft stake under the 'resilient oil' pillar of our strategy for a while, but it wasn't deeply strategic,"" said the first BP executive.
‘A BIT RASH’
During a meeting on Friday Feb. 25, the day after Looney’s management meeting, BP’s board discussed the exit of the Rosneft stake at length, according to the three executives. The topics included the impact of the move on BP, its 190 employees in Russia and wider energy security as a result of the conflict. The three executives said the attendees included BP’s chairman, the Norwegian businessman Helge Lund, and the former head of Britain’s MI6 foreign intelligence service, John Sawers.
BP said Lund declined to comment beyond his remarks in the company’s Feb. 27 announcement, in which the chairman said the board concluded that Russia’s military action meant BP’s involvement in state-owned Rosneft was no longer tenable and that the holding was “no longer aligned with BP’s business and strategy.” Sawers declined to comment, BP said.
A brief board meeting followed Sunday, where members voted to immediately exit the Rosneft stake, the executives told Reuters. Shortly after, Lund and Looney spoke to Rosneft boss Sechin to deliver the news about the exit, according to the three executives, who said the call was cordial.
The following day, Looney addressed BP employees. He told them the company couldn’t reasonably carry on in Russia and that the board had made an informed and rapid decision, according to a person on the call.
BP faces a large writedown. It will lose a large revenue stream: the company received a $640 million dividend last year from Rosneft. By contrast, Shell and Exxon both receive billions of dollars of oil and gas annually, rather than dividends, from their Russian projects, and both have long-term contracts to sell that output that they now need to figure out how to make good on.
""While there may be a significant financial cost to BP in exiting Rosneft, it is unquestionably the right thing to do,"" said Andrew Millington, the head of UK equities at fund manager Abrdn, which owns 0.2% of BP.
Not all shareholders agree. “It seems a bit rash on the part of BP to make such a momentous decision so quickly,” said one fund manager with a stake in BP. “Rosneft is an important part of the business.”
BP's shares have risen 4% since the start of the invasion, while Exxon and Shell stocks are trading 16% and 4% higher, respectively, boosted by the strong rally in oil and gas prices.

As of Tuesday, the company had no buyer for the Rosneft stake, the three senior BP executives said. BP has begun the internal process for selling the stake, they said, but for now that’s more of a formality given there are few potential buyers as more and more countries impose sanctions on Russia.
""Aside, perhaps, from Rosneft itself, there are no clear buyers for its stake at this time in our view,"" said Jason Kenney, an analyst at Santander (MC:SAN) Bank, wrote in a Feb. 28 analyst note.

Investing.com – Oatly Group AB ADR (NASDAQ:OTLY) traded 5.5% higher in premarket Wednesday after the company issued a strong forecast for the ongoing financial year, hoping to make more consumers shift to its plant-based milk. 
The company is guiding its 2022 revenue to be $900 million at the center of its guidance range, a new record following $643 million in 2021.  
The robust outlook comes in even as the company tackled higher logistics and raw material costs in 2021. Oatly is banking on new supply tie-ups, like the one it struck with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) about a year back.   
According to a Reuters report, performance of Oatly's oatmilk at the coffee chain had exceeded expectations. CEO Toni Petersson has said Oatly aims to provide 85-90% of Starbucks' oatmilk needs in 2022.
Revenue in the fourth quarter rose over 46% to a record $186 million on broad-based growth across retail and foodservice channels.
The contribution of foodservice channel to the company’s revenue rose as Western markets relaxed restrictions. Some closures in Asia, particularly in China, offset that growth a little.
The company said it is positioning itself “for an increased rate of growth” as the situation in Europe and other macro headwinds subside.
Oatly is adding capacity and, in the long term, aims to generate a gross profit margin of over 40% with an adjusted basic operating margin of near 20%. It expects its new capacities to lower costs and deliver economies of scale.
Fourth quarter loss before income tax more than doubled to over $85 million, owing to higher finance costs and depreciation due to three new facilities."

""Discovery has decided to suspend the broadcast of its channels and services in Russia,"" the company said.

The announcement comes as CNN, the BBC and others suspended broadcasts from Russia in response to a new law that threatens journalists with prison time for disseminating ""fake"" news about what the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation.""
National Media Group also was in partnership with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which in late 2020 launched a version of the service with Russian subtitles, local films and offered local payment options. Netflix suspended its Russian service on Sunday.

1434,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 07:31AM ET</span>",Food crisis grows as spiralling prices spark export bans,"By Nigel Hunt
LONDON (Reuters) - A global food crisis sparked by Russia's invasion of Ukraine escalated on Wednesday as Indonesia tightened curbs on palm oil exports, adding to a growing list of key producing countries seeking to keep vital food supplies within their borders.
The conflict in Ukraine is threatening global grain production, the supply of edible oils and fertiliser exports, sending basic commodity prices rocketing and mirroring the crisis in energy markets.
Palm oil is the world's most widely used vegetable oil and is used in the manufacture of many products including biscuits, margarine, laundry detergents and chocolate. Palm oil prices have risen by more than 50% this year.
Indonesia's Trade Minister Muhammad Lufti said the export curbs aimed to ensure that cooking oil prices at home remain affordable to consumers.
The rise in prices comes at a time when affordability of food is a major challenge as economies seek to recover from the coronavirus crisis and is also helping to fuel a broader surge in inflation across the globe. 
Russia and Ukraine are also important suppliers of edible oils as well as contributing nearly 30% of global wheat exports.
Ukraine announced on Wednesday it had banned a wide range of agricultural exports including barley, sugar and meat until the end of the year.
The conflict has not only disrupted shipments from the Black Sea region but is also jeopardising prospects for harvests as fertilizer prices soar and supplies shrink in response to a sharp rise in the cost of natural gas - a key component in the manufacturing process for many products.
World food prices rose to a record high in February to post a year-on-year increase of 20.7%, according to the United Nations food agency, while many markets have continued to climb this month.
Malaysian palm oil futures rose to an all-time high following Indonesia's announcement while soybean oil prices jumped to a 14-year peak.
Soybean oil prices have climbed by almost 40% this year.
SCRAMBLING FOR SUPPLIES
Russia and Ukraine are both major producers of sunflower oil and the two countries account for almost 80% of global exports, leaving customers such as India scrambling to secure supplies of alternatives such as palm oil and soyoil.
Chicago wheat futures have climbed around 60% so far this year, threatening to raise the cost of key food staples such as bread.
The loss of two major exporters in Ukraine and Russia has been compounded by news that the condition of the wheat crop in the world's top producer, China, may be the ""worst in history"" according to the country's agriculture minister.
Poor growing conditions in drought-affected parts of the U.S. Plains look set to further tighten supplies.
Serbia announced on Wednesday it will ban exports of wheat, corn, flour and cooking oil as of Thursday to counter price increases while Hungary banned all grain exports last week.
Bulgaria has also announced it will increase its grain reserves and might restrict exports until it has carried out planned purchases.
Grain supplies in Romania, a major exporter, have also tightened as international buyers seek alternatives to Russia or Ukrainian supplies although there are currently no plans to restrict shipments.
Global grain production could also decline as the production of fertilizers, which help to boost crop yields, is curtailed following a rise in natural gas prices.
Yara, one of the world's largest fertiliser makers, said on Wednesday it was curtailing its ammonia and urea output in Italy and France.

The Norwegian company warned last week that the conflict was threatening global food supplies.
Russia, which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" rather than an invasion, had been a major supplier of fertilisers but the country's trade and industry ministry recommended on Friday that producers temporarily halt exports.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Wednesday, rebounding after recent losses amid the first signs of compromise from the Russian and Ukrainian governments while investors digest volatile oil prices.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 430 points, or 1.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 63 points, or 1.5%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 245 points, or 1.9%.
The main Wall Street indices all closed lower Tuesday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 185 points, or 0.6%, moving deeper into correction territory after giving up gains of almost 600 points. The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 0.7%, also into correction territory, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3%, after moving into a bear market on Monday.
There were tentative signs of a diplomatic shift in the conflict after Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia has no intention of occupying Ukraine or overthrowing its government.
These comments came a day after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had “cooled” on the idea of joining NATO, the prospect of which was a prime factor behind Russia’s invasion.
The war in Ukraine and the associated Western sanctions on Russia have sent commodity prices, and the crude market, in particular, soaring to multi-year records. 
This has prompted concerns that this will force the Federal Reserve, already concerned about surging inflation, to hike interest rates more aggressively than initially expected.
The Biden administration added to the volatility late Tuesday by announcing the United States would ban Russian oil imports. However, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday it could release more oil from stocks and will draw up an action plan to swiftly reduce oil usage.
Oil prices weakened Wednesday, also weighed by the news that U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.8 million barrels for the week ended March 4, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute Tuesday, against forecasts of a drop. 
If confirmed by the official Energy Information Administration numbers later Wednesday, this would suggest consumers are reacting to the surging prices at the pump by pulling back on travel.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 3% lower at $119.99 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 2.8% to $124.35. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since July 2008 on Monday, with Brent hitting $139.13 a barrel and WTI $130.50.
In corporate news,  Bumble  (NASDAQ:BMBL) will be in the spotlight after the dating app offered up an optimistic forecast for 2022, expecting revenue to rise by more than 23%, even following its decision to leave the Russian market.
Macy's (NYSE:M) will also be in focus after the retailer chose to repay some debt and refinance existing notes at cheaper interest rates. 
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its newest version of the iPhone SE with its latest mobile processor and 5G capability on Tuesday and people will likely still be talking about it this week.
The major economic release Wednesday will be the January JOLTS jobs openings number, at 10 AM ET (1500 GMT), with last week’s official monthly jobs report showing a vibrant labor market.
Additionally, gold futures fell 1.1% to $2,021.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.7% higher at 1.0974."

BERLIN (Reuters) -Adidas warned of a hit to sales from closing operations in Russia and COVID disruptions in Vietnam but a brighter China outlook helped send the German sportswear group's shares 10% higher on Wednesday.
The company operates about 500 stores in Russia, a quarter of its total, which it said on Monday it had closed along with online sales there. 
For 2022, Adidas (OTC:ADDYY) forecast an 11-13% increase in currency-neutral sales, including the risk to its business in Russia and Ukraine, with Greater China set to see sales increase in the mid-single digits after a consumer boycott in 2021.
The closure of factories in Vietnam due to COVID-19 means a shortage of products will cut first-quarter sales by 600 million euros ($658 million) before a strong rebound from the second quarter, CEO Kasper Rorsted told journalists.
Adidas shares traded up 10.2% at 1030 GMT, helped by the relatively upbeat outlook for 2022, especially for China, with analysts noting the earnings forecast was ahead of consensus expectations.
""The tone appears more constructive here than Puma was a couple of weeks ago,"" said Jefferies analyst James Grzinic.
Puma said last month it expected sales to grow at least 10% in 2022 and cautioned that a consumer boycott in China and cost pressures would limit profit growth.
Adidas said the Ukraine crisis posed a risk to sales of up to 250 million euros, about half its revenue in the region in 2021, or about 1% of total group sales.
Adidas had already recorded sales of about 100 million euros in the region prior to closing its stores and could make a further 100 million if it resumes operations in Russia or if it shifts products to other markets, finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer said.
Adidas has not seen a broader impact on consumer confidence from the Ukraine crisis and is sticking to its medium-term targets, Rorsted said, noting that the sporting goods industry is usually resilient during times of financial turmoil. 
Adidas fourth-quarter sales fell 24% in Greater China, where it said on Tuesday it has appointed Adrian Siu as its new head of the regional business. Siu joined Adidas in 2002 in Hong Kong but left in 2019 to head Chinese brand Cosmo Lady. 
Rorsted said he expected sales to start growing in China from the second quarter, noting the company had signed up local athletes and was making a drive to design more products especially for China to compete with local brands.

The company was targeted during a boycott of Western brands by Chinese consumers who criticised companies for saying they would not source cotton from Xinjiang after reports of human rights abuses there. Beijing denies any abuses.

Investing.com – Adidas stock (DE:ADSGN) soared 10% in Frankfurt trading Wednesday after the shoe and sports apparel maker forecast strong sales in 2022.
The company is expecting its China business to bounce back and help offset the loss of business in Russia. Overall margins are seen higher too with price hikes expected to have a role, according to Bloomberg.
Sales will grow by 11%-13% on a currency-neutral basis as demand for sneakers remains robust, the company said while disclosing its 2021 results.
Adidas expects Greater China sales to increase in mid-single digits, compared to the 3% growth last year when consumer boycott and a push for products made by local manufacturers hurt its sales. Adidas said on Tuesday that it had replaced the head of its Chinese operations, promoting Adrian Siu who also has experience in managing a local brand in China, namely fashion label Cosmo Lady.
Adidas said the war in Ukraine is putting as much as 250 million euros ($273 million) of revenue, or half of its business from Russia and the CIS region, at risk. That reflects the suspension of retail and e-commerce operations in Russia and represents about 1 percentage point of growth in total sales, according to the wire agency.
The company said on Monday it had suspended operations in Russia - where it operates about 500 stores, one-quarter of its total.
North America and Latin America are seen as the biggest sales drivers, with growth even going up to 19%, according to the company's projections. Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific are seen growing around 16%.
Adidas reported a 3% fall in currency-neutral sales in the fourth quarter to 5.14 billion euros, pulled down by Greater China."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a U.S. court, former Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) partner Tim Leissner has admitted to taking $60 million in kickbacks, lying to the bank about his corrupt deals, and twice forging divorce documents to take on new wives. 
Despite his history of deceit, Leissner is the key witness prosecutors are asking jurors to believe in the trial of Roger Ng, a former colleague of Leissner's at Goldman who is charged with helping loot Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund during a scheme that lasted from 2009 to 2014.
Leissner in 2018 pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-bribery law, and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Ng, 49, pleaded not guilty to similar charges and is standing trial in Brooklyn federal court.
In more than a week of testimony, Leissner has described his high-flying lifestyle as the lucrative 1MDB deals made him a ""star,"" and the steps he took to avoid getting caught.
Leissner, 52, said he hoped coming clean would ""clear this chapter of my life."" 
""It's not the proudest time of my life, but at the time I wanted to make more money, even though I was well-paid,"" Leissner testified.
The charges stem from some $6.5 billion in bonds Goldman helped 1MDB sell in 2012 and 2013. Prosecutors say $4.5 billion of that was embezzled by officials, bankers and their associates, in one of the biggest scandals in Wall Street history. 
Goldman in 2020 agreed to pay a $3 billion fine and have its Malaysia subsidiary plead guilty in U.S. court. The bank said at the time it did not adequately ""scrutinize the representations of certain members of the deal team."" 
Leissner said he and Ng, Goldman's top banker for Malaysia, secretly liased with conspirators outside Goldman, and received kickbacks. 
Ng's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, argues Leissner is falsely implicating Ng to lower his own sentence. Prosecutors say Leissner's assertions are backed by other evidence.
Leissner said he spent the kickbacks on a $15 million 170-foot yacht, apartments in London and New York, and an investment in Italian soccer team Inter Milan. 
In 2013 he met Kimora Lee Simmons, an American model and ex-wife of music producer Russell Simmons. They set a wedding date before Leissner finalized a divorce with another woman, so he forged divorce documents - the second time he had pulled such a stunt, he said.
Through it all, Leissner said he privately worried about getting caught. While preparing the final 1MDB bond deal months ahead of Malaysia's 2013 presidential election, Leissner said he was concerned the opposition could win and investigate the deal. 
The ruling party won, but Leissner said critical press coverage of 1MDB kept him on edge. In February 2016, FBI agents served him with a subpoena. Hoping for a green card to live in Los Angeles with his new family, he said he hired a lawyer to explore cooperating. 

But he was arrested in June 2018. He said he pleaded guilty to lighten his sentence, aware it would dash his hopes of a green card. He and Lee Simmons are estranged, her lawyers said. 
""I hope that I don't have to go to prison,"" Leissner testified.

SEOUL/BEIJING (Reuters) - Asian battery makers for electric vehicles are shielded from a big, immediate hit from surging nickel prices amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, thanks to long-term contracts and a diversified supply chain, companies and industry sources said.
Nickel prices doubled on Tuesday to more than $100,000 per tonne, a surge sources blamed on short covering by one of the world's top producers, forcing the London Metal Exchange (LME) to halt nickel trading.
Tsingshan Holding Group bought large amounts of nickel to reduce its short bets on the metal, sources said. Shares of companies exposed to the Chinese producer tumbled on Wednesday.. 
""We have long-term supply contracts with metal suppliers and producers, so we are not expecting any immediate impact on our nickel supplies,"" said an official at South Korea's SK Innovation, whose battery unit SK On supplies to Ford and Kia.
Another official at a South Korean major battery manufacturer, who declined to be identified because the company has not made a statement on the matter, said the firm sources nickel from various countries including Australia and Indonesia so there was ""very limited impact"" on its nickel procurement for now.
Both officials said the companies were closely monitoring the situation after LME's unusual move.
The recent surge in nickel have not had a serious impact on the EV supply chain because Indonesia and other places have the largest nickel mines and the size of Russia's nickel mines is not particularly big, Cui Dongshu, secretary-general of the China Passenger Car Association, said.
Russia accounts for 5% of global nickel production but supplies a fifth of the world's high-grade nickel, according to an estimate from Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI).
Prices of the metal were rising even before Russia invaded Ukraine as inventory dwindled due to battery makers such as SK Innovation and compatriots LG Energy Solution (LGES) and Samsung (KS:005930) SDI, China's CATL and Japan's Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) increasing production to meet growing demand.
Nickel prices rose 25% last year, and before the invasion on Feb. 24 prices were already up about 20% this year. 
Graphic: Nickel Prices surge: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/gdpzybajdvw/MicrosoftTeams-image%20(5).png 
Most battery makers have long-term contracts.
For instance, last year, LGES bought a 4.8% stake in China's Greatpower Nickel & Cobalt Materials and signed a six-year contract with the company to source 20,000 tonnes of nickel starting in 2023.
Some industry sources say rising costs in the long term could hurt automakers, which are already grappling with an acute shortage of semiconductor chips and are likely to pass the cost on to customers.
""I think it depends on how long this ultra high price will last,"" said a U.S.-based board member of a battery materials supplier who declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak with media.

""If it sustains, then the nickel suppliers will have no choice but to ask their customers to accept a renegotiated price. They can always cite the force majeure clause in their contract. No one could predict a war like this.""

Investing.com – Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) stock gained 3% in premarket Wednesday as the retailer pushes to repay debt and refinance the existing one at cheaper interest rates. 
In the latest exercise, the company has refinanced $850 million debt at its 100% subsidiary Macy’s Retail Holdings. The debt was split into equal tranches of $425 million each at coupon rates of 5.875% and 6.125% respectively. This is cheaper than the debt Macy’s took in 2020 and comes in at a time when interest rates are likely to harden.
The new debt, one note maturing in 2030 and the other in 2032, means Macy’s has no significant repayment coming up till 2027 when it repays $71 million carrying an interest rate of 6.79%. It has one note of $6 million due in 2025.  
Macy’s in August repaid $1.3 billion in secured notes with an 8.375% interest rate, one of the highest rates in its debt portfolio at the time, The Wall Street Journal quoted Chief Financial Officer Adrian Mitchell as saying.
Macy’s was close to running out of cash even before the pandemic struck. The business has bounced back in recent quarters, allowing it to repay debt, issue bigger dividends, and do share repurchases.

Investing.com -- First signs of movement in the diplomatic positions of Russia and Ukraine lent some much-needed support to global markets on Wednesday, even as the military campaign continued with undimmed ferocity.
Russia's Foreign Ministry was reported by newswires on Wednesday as saying that Russia's aims do not include overthrowing the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. That's a clear change in tone from the last two weeks, in which President Vladimir Putin and others have talked up the 'denazification of Ukraine' as one of the aims of what it still insists on calling a 'special military operation'. 
Russia ""has no goal to occupy Ukraine, destroy its statehood nor to topple its leadership,"" Interfax quoted Maria Zakharova as saying. 
The comments boosted European stock markets that had already started to show signs of dip-buying earlier in the day. By 5:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), the euro was up 0.8% against the dollar at $1.0985. The STOXX 600 rose 3.3%, while the German DAX, Italian FTSE MIB and French CAC 40 all rose over 4.5%.
The Ministry's comments clarify more ambiguous ones from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to Reuters earlier this week, in which Peskov held out the prospect of stopping military action if its demands were met. 
There have also been tentative signs of compromise from Zelensky, who told ABC News in an interview aired on Monday that he has ""cooled"" on the idea of taking Ukraine into NATO, a move that Russia fears would lead to tactical nuclear missiles aimed at Moscow being based on Ukrainian soil.
""I have cooled down regarding this question a long time ago after we understood that ... NATO is not prepared to accept Ukraine,"" Zelensky said. 
Zelensky also signaled a willingness to discuss the future of the two breakaway republics in the east of Ukraine that Russia has now recognized as independent, eight years after establishing them with its first invasion of Ukraine.
""We can discuss and find the compromise on how these territories will live on,"" Zelensky said, hinting that he may be willing to give up those territories, with their majority-Russian-speaking populations, in order to create a more unified country in the long term. 
""What is important to me is how the people in those territories are going to live who want to be part of Ukraine, who in Ukraine will say that they want to have them in,"" Zelensky said.
The third important shift in diplomatic circles has been in China, one of few countries seen as capable of acting as a mediator between the two warring sides. While China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday that China's relationship with Russia is still ""rock solid"", Beijing has appeared increasingly concerned about the impact of the war on the global economy, and consequently to its own economic well-being. 
""China's exposure to the Ukraine war really comes in three forms,"" Paul Donovan, chief economist with UBS Wealth Management, said in a morning briefing. ""Directly, through the impact of commodity prices on the domestic economy; indirectly through the impact on U.S., European and U.K. demand for goods; and tangentially through quirky effects, like Chinese entities' losses from holding short positions in the nickel market."" The impact on demand for Chinese exports is likely to be the strongest concern over time, Donovan added.
President Xi Jinping held an extensive phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday to urge a peaceful solution and to warn about the consequences of Western sanctions.
Xi also urged ""maximum restraint"" from the warring participants, against the backdrop of an increasingly intense bombardment of Ukrainian cities by Russian artillery."

Investing.com –  Bumble  Inc. (NASDAQ:BMBL) stock surged 19% in premarket trade after the company said 2022 revenue could rise by more than 23%, an optimistic forecast, given the company’s exposure to Russia and its decision to leave the Russian market.
Bumble has a large portion of its engineering talent in Russia and its Badoo app gets 12% of its monthly users from the country, according to Bloomberg. The company employs 120 people in Moscow, the wire agency said.
The company behind the namesake dating app said revenue in the current year could come in between $934 million and $944 million compared to almost $767 million it clocked in 2021.
This is even as the company removes all its apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in Russia and Belarus.
The full-year forecast includes a loss of about $22 million in revenue from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, which will mostly impact Bumble’s Badoo app. Combined sales from the three countries made up about 2.8% of Bumble’s annual revenue.
Adjusted margins at the basic operating level could erode slightly to come in between 26.5% and 27% compared to 27.1% in 2021, according to the company.
The COVID-19 pandemic boosted the use of dating apps as people confined to their homes used virtual platforms to meet new people and develop new relationships, personal and professional. Now even as economies reopen, the pandemic-led surge in users is still holding up and users are only paying more.
Total paying users grew 11% to 2.98 million even as users of Badoo declined. Total average revenue per user rose by $2.81 to near $23.
In the fourth quarter, revenue jumped about 26% to top $208 million while net loss nearly halved to go below $15 million."

Investing.com - European stock markets traded higher Wednesday, recovering some of the sharp losses since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war ahead of this week’s European Central Bank meeting.
By 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 3.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 3.5%, while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 traded 1.7% higher.
European stock markets have been hit hard by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the associated Western sanctions pushing commodity prices to record levels, with oil prices, in particular, soaring amid concerns about supply disruptions.
The announcement late Tuesday that the U.S. will ban Russian oil imports added to the volatility, while the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, responded Wednesday, stating that the agency is ready to bring more oil to the markets by releasing additional stocks, and it would come up with an action plan to ""reduce oil in a hurry.""
Investors have decided to take advantage of these sharp losses - the DAX is down more than 8% over the last week - to buy some heavily discounted stocks ahead of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting, with the specter of stagflation raising expectations that policymakers might delay rate hikes until late in the year.
In corporate news, Adidas (LON:0OLD) stock soared over 8% after the German sportswear company forecast an increase in sales of 11-13% for 2022, with a recovery in its China business more than making up for the 250 million euros ($273 million) hit that it expects to take from halting its business in Russia.
Oil prices pushed higher, extending the recent rally which has seen crude surging more than 30% since Russia, the world's second-largest crude exporter, invaded Ukraine. Countries have scrambled for oil from different sources amid escalating sanctions on Moscow and fears of further disruptions to oil supply.
Gains have been partially held back by the news that U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.8 million barrels for the week ended March 4, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute Tuesday, against forecasts of a drop. This suggests consumers are reacting to the surging prices at the pump by pulling back on travel.
By 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1% higher at $124.99 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 1.4% to $129.84. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since July 2008 on Monday, with Brent hitting $139.13 a barrel and WTI $130.50.
Additionally, gold futures fell 0.1% to $2,041.90/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.5% higher at 1.0955."

As part of the initial public offering (IPO), Eni has committed to underwrite 17.5 million pounds of the capital increase, with an option to go up to 25 million pounds, the company added in a statement.
LiveStream and Eni are financial backers of NEOA which will be the UK's largest special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) focused on the energy transition.
The vehicle will look for a business target to acquire in Europe or the UK in areas that include hydrogen, green ammonia, carbon capture and energy storage.
""Our partnership with NEOA highlights our commitment to accelerating the path of decarbonisation of fossil fuels and hard to abate industrial processes in the short term"", Eni's Chief Financial Officer Francesco Gattei said.
A SPAC is a shell company that raises money in an initial public offering to merge with a privately held company, which then becomes publicly traded as a result.

Eni, which last year raised its climate ambitions with a pledge to be carbon neutral by 2050, is investing heavily in clean businesses as it pivots away from oil and gas.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 03:45AM ET</span>",Cathay seeks to boost cargo capacity amid pain from new quarantine rules,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) -Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd returned to profit in the second half of last year but has since been hamstrung by tough new quarantine rules for crew and said it is trying to boost cargo capacity as much as possible in an effort to cope.
Hong Kong's flagship airline managed a profit of about HK$2 billion in the second half, thanks to cost cuts and strong cargo demand and pricing, even though it flew 85% fewer passengers than in 2020, when it was also affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
That helped it book a slightly smaller-than-expected annual loss of HK$5.5 billion ($700 million) - also a big improvement from a loss of HK$21.65 billion the prior year. 
Cathay shares closed 4.7% higher, outperforming a 0.7% decline in the broader market. 
Chairman Patrick Healy said, however, that the airline has had an ""extremely challenging"" start to 2022 after Hong Kong tightened crew quarantine requirements and banned passenger flights from major markets like the United States, Britain and Australia to contain COVID-19 cases.
""Exactly when current restrictions might change, we have no way of knowing,"" he told reporters.
The airline has forecast it will burn through HK$1 billion to HK$1.5 billion of cash a month starting in February due to the new rules.
Since January, the airline has been operating just 2% of its pre-pandemic passenger capacity and less than a third of its pre-pandemic cargo capacity due to those constraints.
But the airline, which relied on cargo for 79% of its revenue last year, could benefit from rising freight prices as a result of disruptions to the Europe-Asia market as European and Japanese carriers avoid Russian airspace.
Air freight rates between China and northern Europe have jumped 34% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, according to the Freightos Air Index.
Cathay, like rivals in mainland China and South Korea, is continuing to use Russian airspace on flights to Europe, according to flight tracking website FlightRadar24, keeping flight times shorter at a time of high fuel prices.
However, crew quarantine rules make it difficult for Cathay to add freight flights to take advantage of rising demand.
Cathay is reliant on pilots volunteering to fly tough rosters that involve at least three weeks of confinement to hotel rooms when flying and then upon return to Hong Kong an additional week of quarantine for cargo pilots and an additional two weeks for passenger pilots.
""We are not too concerned about the demand side,"" Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Ronald Lam said. ""The biggest hurdle for the outlook for the rest of 2022 is on the supply side – mainly on crew quarantine arrangements. If there is any relaxation in the coming months we would have a more positive outlook for the rest of the year.""
Cathay said it had HK$30.3 billion of liquidity as of Dec. 31, including a HK$7.8 billion undrawn loan from the Hong Kong government. 
""Depending on the situation we may draw down or we may not,"" Chief Financial Officer Rebecca Sharpe said of the loan.

Rival Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY) Ltd which also lacks a domestic market but has less-strict travel rules, reported a profit in the December quarter and has forecast it will reach around 51% of pre-pandemic passenger capacity this month.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 03:31AM ET</span>",Britain to force Big Tech to combat online scams,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) -Britain said on Tuesday it would force Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and other online platforms to prevent paid-for fraudulent adverts after calls from regulators and consumer groups for a stronger crackdown on scams.
The government said its draft law on preventing online harms would include the requirement for large platforms to improve protection from criminals impersonating celebrities or companies to steal personal data, peddle unsafe financial investments or break into bank accounts.
Communications regulator Ofcom will check if platforms have put in place systems to prevent and remove fake adverts. The watchdog could block services or issue a fine of up to 18 million pounds ($24 million) or 10% of annual turnover, the government said.
""These changes to the upcoming Online Safety bill will help stop fraudsters conning people out of their hard-earned cash using fake online adverts,"" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said in a statement.
Online scams from advertisements on Google, Facebook, Twitter and other social media mushroomed as more people went online during lockdowns to fight COVID-19.
A British record of 754 million pounds was stolen in the first six months of 2021 in banking scams, up by almost a third from the same period in 2020, according to data from UK Finance, a banking industry body.
In response to pressure from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), some online services are limiting adverts for financial products to companies regulated by the FCA, which has called for stronger powers.
""This could make a huge difference to stemming the tide of fake and fraudulent ads on social media and search engines which cause devastating financial and emotional harm to innocent victims,"" said Anabel Hoult, chief executive of consumer campaign group Which?
The government said it was also launching a public consultation on tightening rules for the online advertising industry, either by strengthening the current self-regulation approach, or by creating a new watchdog.
Harmful or misleading adverts, such as those promoting negative body images, and adverts for illegal activities such as weapons sales could face tougher rules and sanctions, it said.

Influencers failing to declare they are being paid to promote products on social media could also be subject to stronger penalties, the government said.

When McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) opened in central Moscow's Pushkin Square in 1990, it became a symbol of thriving American capitalism as the Soviet Union fell. 
Now, news that McDonald's, together with PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), have stopped sales in Russia, is a further sign of a new dividing line being drawn between East and West following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 
Russia, meanwhile, warned on Wednesday it was working on a broad response to sanctions that would be swift and felt in the West's most sensitive areas. 
For some, the move by companies such as McDonald's is overdue - after all a slew of major corporations had already cut ties with Russia as the West ramped up sanctions. Others argue such action can harm public opinion among Russians, suffering from the economic pain unleashed by the conflict.
After days of selling, some respite appears on the cards for world stock markets. European and U.S. stock futures are trading in positive territory and MSCI's world stock index is steady near one-year lows.
Perhaps, the bad news is priced in for now?
Oil prices remain one to watch, having risen again following a new U.S. ban on Russian oil. Britain also announced it will phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by end-2022.
Brent crude is above $131 a barrel, taking its gains since the Feb 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine to almost 35%. 
That surge is already being felt by consumers via rocketing fuel prices at the pump. 
Prices for aluminium a key Russian export, jumped 5% on Wednesday, a day after the London Metal Exchange suspended nickel trading following a doubling of prices that was blamed on short-covering by a top producer.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's second-biggest bank UniCredit said a full write-off of its Russian business, including cross-border exposure, would cost around 7.4 billion euros ($8.1 billion), leaving its capital distribution plans hanging by a thread.
UniCredit, which is one of Europe's banks most exposed to Russia, said it would still be able to pay proposed cash dividends for 2021 even in an extreme scenario where it zeroed its exposure.
That would shave two percentage points off a key capital ratio, which stood at 15.03% at the end of last year - lowering it to just above 13%.
Provided this key measure of financial strength stays above 13%, UniCredit said it remained committed to buying back its own shares for up to 2.58 billion euros under the strategy new CEO Andrea Orcel announced in December.
""Whilst we do not consider this extreme scenario as our base case, we are taking a prudent and sustainable approach to our distributions,"" UniCredit said.
UniCredit said it would provide quarterly updates on the up to 200 basis point impact, and if the ultimate capital hit was smaller than its worst-case scenario it would use up to an equivalent amount for the share buyback.
""The buyback (or at least part of it) could now be delayed pending clarity on eventual Russian-related losses,"" Jefferies analyst Benjie Creelan-Sandford said.
Orcel's payout pledge had lifted UniCredit shares to a near four-year high of 15.85 euros a share last month, before tensions over Ukraine mounted.
The stock closed up 6% at 9.017 euros on Tuesday, having lost more than 40% from last month's highs.
Analysts had warned Russian exposure cast a shadow over Orcel's payout plans, which in turn are a key element in the former UBS banker's M&A strategy.
Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Orcel had been poised to launch a takeover offer for smaller rival Banco BPM in an all-share deal that aimed to capitalise on the stock price recovery, sources have told Reuters.
UniCredit said its Russian client cross-border exposure stood at 4.5 billion euros, net of guarantees of around 1 billion euros by non-Russian state export agencies. 
Around 30% of the exposure is to oil and gas companies with sanction-hit counterparties accounting for less than 5% of the total.
UniCredit Bank Russia, its local arm and Russia's 14th largest lender, had risk-weighted assets of 9.4 billion euros at the end of 2021.

""Net of foreign exchange hedges, our direct exposure to UniCredit Bank Russia is reduced to around 1.9 billion euros,"" it said.

1455,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 02:16AM ET</span>",Banks in talks with distressed buyers on Russian assets - sources,"By Davide Barbuscia and Yoruk Bahceli
NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are having conversations with potential buyers on how to get rid of their exposure to Russian corporate loans, but sanctions fears and pricing uncertainty are limiting trading activity and the ability of buyers to act, several banking sources said.
Punishing Western sanctions on Moscow in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine have prompted some distressed debt buyers to approach banks holding Russian loans to sound out their appetite to potentially sell that exposure at a discount, two bankers said.
Another banker said he had an opportunity to buy some Russian companies' loans but dismissed the offer because of fears that more sanctions could further limit the ability to recover value.
The discussions, though tentative, highlight foreign banks' uncertainty on how to manage their exposure to Russia, which according to Bank for International Settlements data is to the tune of $120 billion. 
Banks tend to hold loans in their portfolios, only selling down their exposure quietly through bilateral transactions as they do not want to be seen as dumping the paper in the market. 
One of the sources said he was approached by distressed debt desks at two U.S. banks last week to discuss any potential interest in selling loans, but he said he was sceptical talks would lead anywhere.
""I think they might say they’re interested, it’s exciting for distressed markets, but I think we’re some way off from seeing any real liquidity,"" the banker said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the talks are private.
Global banks have experience with sanctions but the curbs on Russia are unmatched in their scale, speed and complexity and may yet grow, prompting banks to adopt extreme caution in all of their dealings involving Russian entities and assets.
A loan banker at a U.S. lender said that while there had been some talks on transacting Russian bank debt in the secondary market, activity was limited also because of lack of clarity on how any deal would be settled.
""Every distressed desk in this situation, they can see something that they can buy at 20, 30 cents on the dollar ... they will talk to banks but not necessarily agreeing anything,"" he added.
In addition to sanctions risk, activity is further constrained because it is difficult to put a price on Russian assets, as some hope drops are temporary and prefer to hold tight rather than sell at huge discounts, some sources said.
The discussions are not limited to bank loans: funds specialising in distressed debt have also been looking at buying Russian bonds, said a lawyer in London who said his firm was contacted by funds looking at such trades.
""I don't know a single distressed fund that is doing nothing right now, sitting around,"" said the lawyer.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) this week said all Russian bonds will be excluded from its emerging markets indexes at the end of the month, a move that will add more constraints to trading Russian paper. 

""Liquidity isn't great obviously, but there is a bid and there is an offer in the market today,"" said Marcelo Assalin, head of Emerging Market Debt at William Blair Investment Management, adding Russian bonds were being sold at around 15 cents on the dollar.
""Index exclusion will cause more forced selling... Sooner or later the bond prices will be close to zero and most fund managers won't be able to hold them,"" he said.

European stock markets have been hit hard by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with the associated Western sanctions pushing commodity prices to record levels, with oil prices, in particular, soaring amid concerns about supply disruptions.
The announcement late Tuesday that the U.S. will ban Russian oil imports added to the volatility, with Britain adding it would phase these imports out by the end of the year. The EU has published plans to cut its reliance on Russian gas by two-thirds this year.
Russia issued an order saying it would restrict trade in some goods and raw materials in response to sanctions.
However, investors are set to take advantage of these sharp losses - the DAX is down more than 8% over the last week - to buy some heavily discounted stocks ahead of Thursday’s European Central Bank meeting, with the specter of stagflation raising expectations that policymakers might delay rate hikes until late in the year.
Ahead of this, Russian forces have intensified their bombardment of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, while iconic American brands like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) have announced they are halting business in Russia as a response.
In corporate news, earnings continue to roll in across Europe, with Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), Adidas (OTC:ADDYY), Continental (DE:CONG), Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY),  Legal & General  (LON:LGEN) and  Prudential  (LON:PRU) among the big names reporting Wednesday.
Oil prices pushed higher, extending the recent rally which has seen crude surging more than 30% since Russia, the world's second-largest crude exporter, invaded Ukraine. Countries have scrambled for oil from different sources amid escalating sanctions on Moscow and fears of further disruptions to oil supply.
Gains have been partially held back by the news that U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.8 million barrels for the week ended March 4, according to data from the American Petroleum Institute Tuesday, against forecasts of a drop. This suggests consumers are reacting to the surging prices at the pump by pulling back on travel.
By 2 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.1% higher at $126.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2.2% to $130.84. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since July 2008 on Monday, with Brent hitting $139.13 a barrel and WTI $130.50.
Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $2,058.45/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0911."
1457,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 01:00AM ET</span>",Markets stagger as Russia sanctions intensify,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Ira Iosebashvili
(Reuters) -Plummeting stocks, soaring commodity prices and tightening global financial conditions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are clouding the outlook for markets already unsettled by the prospect of a hawkish Federal Reserve.
Dramatic moves are everywhere you look, from a bear market in the Nasdaq Composite Index and wild rallies in oil and other raw materials to surges in popular haven assets such as gold and the U.S. dollar.
Hanging over it all is the Fed, which is widely expected to raise rates at its monetary policy meeting next week for the first time in more than three years. Some investors now worry that the U.S. central bank will have to keep raising rates to contain rising inflation despite an expected hit to growth from geopolitical instability, risking a recession. 
“Traders are not used to this kind of volatility in markets,” said Michael O’Rourke of Jones Trading. ""Everyone is trying to figure out what is the next threat and where the next distortion is.” 
RAW MATERIALS RALLY
Sanctions against commodity-export giant Russia by the United States and its allies have stoked a rally in the price of oil, metals, wheat and other commodities, a move investors fear will exacerbate already high inflation while weighing on global growth - a condition known as stagflation.
Brent crude is up more than 25% since the beginning of March while nickel prices more than doubled on Tuesday, forcing the London Metal Exchange to halt trading in the metal. 
""For the U.S. economy, we now see stagflation, with persistently higher inflation and less economic growth than expected before the (Ukraine) war. A recession can no longer be ruled out,"" strategist Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research wrote in a recent note to clients.
BEARS EMERGING
The Nasdaq slipped 3.6% on Monday, taking it more than 20% below its recent peak, confirming that the index is in a bear market, according to a common definition. Germany’s DAX is in bear territory as well, while the benchmark S&P 500, down nearly 12% this year, recently confirmed a correction.
CREAKY PLUMBING
Financial indicators are showing increasing signs of stress throughout markets. One of these is the so-called FRA-OIS spread, which measures the gap between the U.S. three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate. It was recently at its highest level since May 2020.
A higher spread reflects rising interbank lending risk or banks hoarding U.S. dollars, meaning that it is widely viewed as a proxy for banking sector risk.
The rush for dollars has been a major contributor to the greenback's advance against the euro over the last two weeks, according to Huw Roberts, head of analytics at Quant Insight in New York.
More broadly, global financial conditions – the umbrella phrase for how metrics such as exchange rates, equity swings and borrowing costs affect the availability of funding in the economy – are at their tightest in around two years. 
GYRATIONS
Volatility in stocks, currencies and rates is at multi-year highs, as investors calibrate their portfolios for higher commodity prices and a potentially prolonged conflict in eastern Europe.
The Cboe, known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, was recently at 33 and has shot up by about 16 points this year.
Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) rises and falls in Treasury yields – fueled by bets on how aggressive the Fed will be in raising rates in 2022 as well as a flight to safety in U.S. government bonds, have taken the ICE (NYSE:ICE) BoFAML MOVE Index to its highest level since March 2020.
Meanwhile, gyrations in currencies and a rally in the U.S. dollar has lifted the  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Currency Volatility Index to a near-two-year high.

FLIGHT TO SAFETY
Not surprisingly, investors have been sheltering in gold, the dollar, the Swiss franc and other so-called safe havens, driving up their prices to multi-month highs. Prices for the yellow metal are up more than 10% this year.

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2022 12:16AM ET</span>",Factbox-Airline hedging and surcharges offset some oil price pain,"(Reuters) -The price of oil has surged to its highest point since 2008 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding to airline costs at a time when carriers have been struggling to recover from a pandemic-related collapse in demand.
Oil prices were already strong because of tight global supplies, but the conflict in Ukraine has sent prices into overdrive; the northwest European jet fuel price in the spot market has soared by 85% since Feb. 25 to $1,649 a tonne on Wednesday.
Malaysia's AirAsia on Saturday introduced fuel surcharges on tickets for the first time since 2015. Chinese airlines, meanwhile, raised fuel surcharges on domestic routes and Emirates, Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings have also raised surcharges recently.
Some airlines have oil hedges that will help to offset some of the price increase, but other carriers are fully unhedged, including U.S. majors United Airlines, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), though the latter does own an oil refinery. 
Many carriers are also being squeezed by the need to fly longer routes to avoid Russian and Ukrainian airspace.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) 
The airline has hedged 72% of oil consumption for the first quarter and 63% for the second quarter at $90 a barrel, with smaller amounts hedged in the second half, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 17. 
Air New Zealand
The airline has hedged 1.34 million barrels of oil in the six months to June 30 and 707,500 barrels in the following half-year period, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 24. In late February it raised international fares by about 5%, citing rising oil prices and general cost inflation. 
Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) 
The Hong Kong airline has hedged its entire first-quarter consumption and about half of its expected second-quarter consumption, it said on Wednesday. It has also hedged lower amounts through the end of 2023.
easyJet (LON:EZJ) 
The European airline 60% hedged for fuel in the financial year to Sept. 30 at about $504 per metric tonne, it said on Jan. 27.
IAG (LON:ICAG)
The British Airways owner is hedged against volatile crude prices for two years, Chief Executive Luis Gallego said on Feb. 25. It has covered about 60% for the whole of 2022.
Based on a fuel price scenario of $900 a tonne, the company would be paying $690 a tonne in the first quarter after hedging 70% of its fuel and foreign exchange, a Feb. 25 results presentation shows.
In the second quarter the price would rise to $750 after hedging 65% of fuel and foreign exchange, to $775 in the third quarter with 56% of its fuel and foreign exchange hedged and $795 in the final quarter with a little less than half of its fuel and foreign exchange hedged.
Lufthansa 
The German airline is 63% hedged in 2022 at a break-even price of $74 a barrel, it said in a results presentation on March 3.
Qantas Airways
The Australian airline has more than 90% of its fuel hedged for the six months to June 30, Chief Executive Alan Joyce said on Tuesday, adding it had also hedged 50% of its fuel for the following quarter.
Ryanair 
The budget carrier is 80% hedged on fuel out to 2023, but rising prices will still cost the group about 50 million euros ($54.2 million) over the next 12 months, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on March 2, adding that Ryanair would not introduce fuel charges for the summer.
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY)
The airline hedged 30% of its oil needs at an average Brent crude price of $57 a barrel for the six months to March 31, it said in a results presentation in November. It had also hedged 40% of its needs at an average price of $60 for the following five quarters. It said on Monday that it had no updates from guidance in November.
Wizz Air 
The European budget airline on Monday said it has covered its fuel costs for the next four months with zero-cost hedges. 

For March, it has covered half its needs with a price ceiling of $1,172 a tonne and 40% of its needs for the first quarter to end-June at $1,142 a tonne. Its financial year ends on March 31, 2023.

1459,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 10:02PM ET</span>","Asian Stocks Down, Investors Digest Chinese Consumer, Producer Price Data","By Gina Lee
Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Wednesday morning, with China releasing factory-gate data and the U.S. as well as the U.K. banning on Russian oil.
China’s Shanghai Composite edged down 0.15% by 9:52 PM ET (2:52 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component inched down 0.07%. Data released earlier in the day showed that the consumer price index (CPI) grew 0.6% month-on-month and 0.9% year-on-year in February 2022. The producer price index grew 8.8% year-on-year.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 1.23%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.23%, with the GDP growing 1.1% quarter-on-quarter and 4.6% year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 2021.
In Australia, the ASX 200 rose 0.94% after the Westpac consumer sentiment contracted 4.2% in March.
South Korean markets were closed, with voting for the country’s next president currently underway.
The U.S. will ban imports of Russian fossil fuels, while the U.K. will prohibit Russian oil but not natural gas and coal. The moves are the latest response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 and contributed to an already-volatile commodities market.
Supply disruptions and inflationary shocks as the sanctions on resources-rich Russia could also impact economic recovery. This could add to U.S. Federal Reserve’s inflation challenge ahead of its policy decision, to be handed down in the following week.
Investors are widely expecting the Fed to hike interest rates by 25 basis points in its decision, but some expect the central bank to take a slightly less hawkish stance over 2022.
“The Fed doesn’t seem to be getting a break in terms of the inflation problem that they are trying to solve by raising these rates, so it doesn’t look likely that we’ll see a less aggressive Fed over the next year or so,” Advisors Capital Management portfolio manager JoAnne Feeney told Bloomberg.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said an interest rate hike later in 2022 is “plausible” as Russia’s invasion creates a new supply shock. The European Central Bank will also hand down its policy decision on Thursday.
“The duration of this incursion is really going to weigh on the economics of both Europe and the U.S.,” Crossmark Global Investments chief market strategist Victoria Fernandez told Bloomberg. The firm is cautious but has been in the market trying to be “opportunistic,” she added.
On the data front, the U.S. will release its own CPI on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO),  McDonald’s Corp. (NYSE:MCD), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are the latest companies to suspend operations in Russia in protest at the invasion of Ukraine. Fitch Ratings also slashed Russia’s credit rating and warned that a bond default is “imminent.”
Russia intensified its bombardment of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, according to the U.S. The Russian stock market extended a trading halt, attempting to slow tumbling prices as the Western sanctions start to take their toll. Although currency trading could reopen, the London Metal Exchange suspended nickel trading on Tuesday until at least Mar. 11 due to highly volatile prices."

IAC Chairman Diller, his stepson von Furstenberg, and music mogul Geffen have an unrealized profit of about $60 million on the options trade, based on the recent Activision share price of around $80, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter.
The Justice Department is investigating whether any of the options trades violated insider-trading laws, the report said, adding that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is separately conducting a civil insider-trading investigation.
Diller told Reuters that none of them had any knowledge about a potential acquisition of Activision by Microsoft and that they acted simply on the belief that Activision was undervalued and therefore had the potential for going private or being acquired.
""If we had any such information we would never have traded on it – it strains credulity to believe we would have done so three days before Microsoft and Activision made their announcement,"" he added in a statement.

Spokespersons for the Justice Department and the SEC did not respond to Reuters' request for comment, while von Furstenberg and Geffen could not be immediately reached.
In January, Microsoft announced plans to buy Activision the ""Call of Duty"" maker for $68.7 billion in the biggest gaming industry deal in history.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Yum Brands Inc, parent company of fried chicken chain KFC, said it was pausing investment in Russia, a key market that helped the brand achieve record development last year.
Yum also said it was suspending operations of its 70 KFC company-owned restaurants in the country and finalizing an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut restaurant operations in Russia, in partnership with its master franchisee.
Yum, which has at least 1,000 KFC and 50 Pizza Hut locations in Russia that are nearly all independent franchisees, said in a post on its website dated Monday that it had ""suspended all investment and restaurant development in Russia while we continue to assess additional options.""
The restaurants are owned and operated independently through franchise agreements, meaning Yum does not have as much control as if it ran them itself but also has less exposure to financial and operational risks.
Last year was a record year of development for KFC, led by new restaurants opening in China, India and Russia, executives said during an earnings call on Feb. 9.
Overall, KFC international opened more than 2,400 gross units in 2021. In Russia, the company was opening about 100 new restaurants annually and had expected to continue ""a similar expansion strategy going forward.""
Many companies have begun to pull their business out of Russia amid sanctions and outrage over the invasion of Ukraine. Calls for more companies to follow suit are growing.

McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) said on Tuesday it would temporarily close all 847 of its restaurants in Russia including its iconic Pushkin Square location, increasing pressure on other global brands to pause operations in the country following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Major global brands, including PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, have been pressured to withdraw from Russia by consumers and investors such as the New York state's pension fund.

At the event, titled ""Peek Performance"", Apple also introduced its fastest chipset, a brand new high-performance computer and brought nearly all of its devices on the 5G bandwagon. 
iPHONE SE - FASTER, BETTER, CHEAPER
It is the first update to iPhone SE since 2020 and it will now come with 5G and a faster A15 Bionic chip. 
The $429 phone gives Apple a better chance to compete with industry leaders Samsung (KS:005930), Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) and others in the mid-range smartphone market and bring more users looking for faster connectivity on the Apple ecosystem. 
In comparison, iPhone 13 with 5G, which was launched last year, starts at $799. The previous iPhone SE had a $399 price tag. 
The new iPhone SE will start shipping from March 18.
IPAD REFRESH
The iPad Air gets its first refresh in two years with a new design, 5G connectivity and a faster M1 chipset found in MacBooks.
The advanced chip would make the device two times faster than the best-selling laptop in its range, Apple claimed. The iPad is priced at $599 and will be available from March 18.
""MONSTER"" CHIP
Apple launched a new in-house chip, M1 Ultra, made by fusing two M1 Max chips, previously Apple's most powerful chip for MacBooks. The chip is twice as fast and will be loaded in the newly launched Mac Studio.
BRAND NEW MAC STUDIO
Apple launched ""Mac Studio,"" a powerful high performance computer for musicians, video editors and filmmakers.
Mac Studio uses the M1 Max chip, which is 3.4 times faster than iMac, while the one with M1 Ultra is 80% faster than Apple's top Mac Pro.

With the 27-inch, 5-K retina display ""Studio Display,"" the MacStudio looks similar to the MacMini, and can be tucked under the display.
Mac Studio, a first of its kind, is priced at $1,999 for the version with the M1 chip and costs as high as $3,999 for the M1 Ultra loaded computer. Studio Display is priced at $1,599.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -McDonald's Corp said on Tuesday it would temporarily close all 847 of its restaurants in Russia including its iconic Pushkin Square location, increasing pressure on other global brands to pause operations in the country following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. 
The closure of the McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) restaurants will also carry symbolic importance in Russia, where the first location to open, in central Moscow in 1990, became a symbol of flourishing American capitalism as the Soviet Union fell. 
McDonald's said it would continue to pay salaries to its 62,000 employees in Russia. Because of its large size and global reach, the chain is often copied by other brands if it takes a stance on an issue or makes a major operational change.
""If they decide to do something, then probably others will follow,"" said international franchise consultant William Edwards of companies' conversations about whether to follow McDonald's by closing locations in Russia on moral grounds.
Major global brands, including McDonald's and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, have been pressured to withdraw from Russia by consumers and investors including the New York state's pension fund. 
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation.""
McDonald's opened in Pushkin Square 32 years ago as the Soviet Union was collapsing. That new restaurant represented the thawing Cold War tensions at a time when some young Russians were desperate to get their hands on blue jeans and other Americana. 
""It's impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia,"" McDonald's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, said in a note emailed companywide on Tuesday and posted on the company's website. ""We are experiencing disruptions to our supply chain along with other operational impacts. We will also closely monitor the humanitarian situation."" 
Paul Musgrave, a University of Massachusetts political science professor, said the McDonald's closures show how the quick and broad imposition of Western sanctions on Russia will have a lasting economic impact.
He also said the decision puts to rest the theory that business ties will inevitably lead to closer U.S.-Russian relations. ""It's the spiritual end to any hope that commercial ties by themselves would sustain political integration."" 
Added Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who is tracking major companies' stances on Russia: ""I'm so glad that they realized it's a complicated situation, and I'm glad they came around and made the right decision ... It's a really important impact, and it's symbolic as much as it is substantive.""
Of its nearly 850 Russian McDonald's locations, 84% are owned by the company. The remainder are mostly operated by Moscow-based franchisee Rosinter Restaurants Holding.
COMPLEXITIES 
Because McDonald's owns many locations in Russia, it has more direct access to shutting operations. That may not be as easy for other fast-food chains in Russia - including Yum Brands Inc's KFC and Pizza Hut, Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR)'s Burger King, Subway, Papa John's International (NASDAQ:PZZA) Inc,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Inc. The companies' Russian locations are almost entirely run by independent operators and subject to complex international franchise agreements.
For example, Burger King's owner, Restaurant Brands, on Tuesday told Reuters that because Burger King ""is a stand-alone business owned and operated by franchisees in Russia,"" the company has ""long-standing legal agreements that are not easily changeable in the foreseeable future.""

Some fast-food franchisees with locations in Russia are not even based in Russia, such as Netherlands-based DP Eurasia, which runs Domino's restaurants in Russia, as well as in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
""These are often long, complicated, heavily negotiated agreements. Every one of them can be different from everyone else,"" said Larry Weinberg, who chairs the franchise practice at the law firm Cassels Brock & Blackwell LLP.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -McDonald's, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Starbucks stopped sales of their best-known products in Russia on Tuesday, offering a united rebuke of the war on Ukraine by companies that define America for much of the world.
Pepsi and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) were corporate pioneers whose work with the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet Russian state decades ago were seen as improving international relations. 
All four companies have major operations in Russia.
McDonald's said it would go on paying salaries to its 62,000 employees in Russia as it closed 847 restaurants. The first location to open in Russia, in central Moscow's Pushkin Square in 1990, became a symbol of flourishing American capitalism as the Soviet Union fell.
""I’m glad they came around and made the right decision,"" Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who is tracking major companies’ stances on Russia, said after the move by McDonald's. ""It’s a really important impact, and it's symbolic as much as it is substantive."" 
 Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) is temporarily closing hundreds of stores. PepsiCo Inc will suspend all advertising in Russia and stop the sale of its drinks brands, while continuing to sell essentials such as milk and baby food. Rival  Coca-Cola Co  said it will suspend its business there.
Coca-Cola was the official drink of the 1980 Olympic Games in Moscow, despite the United States boycotting the event in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Scores of other companies also have rebuked Russia, and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) said on Tuesday it would stop accepting new customers for its cloud services in Russia and Ukraine. Universal Music (AS:UMG) suspended all operations in Russia, and online dating service Bumble Inc will remove its apps from stores in Russia and Belarus.
Earlier, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc stopped buying oil from Russia and said it would cut links to the country entirely while the United States stepped up its campaign to punish Moscow by banning Russian oil and energy imports.
Moscow has termed the attack a ""special military operation"" aimed not at occupying territory but at destroying Ukraine's military capabilities.
The West's moves to isolate Russia economically for attacking its neighbour have hit hard global commodity and energy markets, sending prices soaring and threatening to derail the nascent recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Britain too said it would ban imports of Russian oil but only by gradually phasing them out during 2022 to give businesses time to find alternative sources of supply.
The London Metal Exchange (LME) halted trade in nickel on Tuesday after prices of the metal, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, doubled to more than $100,000 a tonne.
Shell's decision to abandon Russia comes days after it faced a barrage of criticism for buying Russian oil – a transaction that two weeks ago would have been routine.
""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil to be refined into products like petrol and diesel - despite being made with security of supplies at the forefront of our thinking - was not the right one, and we are sorry,"" Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said.
Shell and rivals BP (NYSE:BP) Plc and  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) have all announced plans to sell holdings in Russia and exit the country, leaving France's TotalEnergies relatively isolated in hanging on to its investments there.
HYBRID DELAYS
Mining group BHP warned the surge in commodity prices could spill over into already-skyrocketing inflation and potentially affect global growth.
Nickel prices soared when China's Tsingshan Holding Group, one of the world's top nickel and stainless steel producers, bought large amounts of nickel to reduce its bets that prices would fall, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Tsingshan and the LME declined to comment.
As well as high-grade nickel, the price of other metals used in car production, from aluminium in bodywork to palladium in catalytic converters, has soared, and industry supply chains have been broken.
Volkswagen AG (OTC:VWAGY) said it would stop taking orders for numerous plug-in hybrid models from Wednesday, as supply-chain troubles exacerbated the production delays caused by chip shortages.

The carmaker had already halted production in Russia and has also suspended production at several factories in Germany as it has struggled to obtain components.
Orders for the plug-in hybrid versions of Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)'s Golf, Tiguan, Passat, Arteon and Touareg models would be halted until further notice and delivery of already-placed orders might not happen this year, the company said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Apple Inc on Tuesday added 5G connectivity to its low-cost iPhone SE and iPad Air and introduced a faster chip for a new desktop, a high point in Apple's move to power its devices with microprocessors designed in house.
The new Studio desktop starts at $3,999 with the new M1 Ultra chip. The iPad Air also got Apple's M1 chip that was developed for laptops.
""Apple Silicon strategy is the key highlight,"" said analyst Neil Shah of Counterpoint Research. ""Apple is scaling the portfolio of its in-house semiconductor capabilities to power a broader set of richer devices from affordable iPhone SE to the most powerful product Mac Studio.""
Apple's Mac Pro still runs on  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC) microprocessors.
Apple slightly hiked the price on the iPhone SE to $429 from $399 for the previous model. The new phone starts shipping March 18.
The iPhone SE comes with an A15 Bionic chip, which Apple says is the fastest among competition, a 4.7-inch retina display and a home button with touch ID.
""This is important for our existing users who want a smaller iPhone at a great value,"" Chief Executive Tim Cook said.
Nabila Popal, an analyst at IDC, said the new iPhone SE will cater to consumers looking for a budget 5G device, and it could be particularly popular given the economic uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
""A cheaper iPhone with 5G is good news for Apple, especially in these times of uncertainty,"" Popal said.
But demand for larger screens could negatively impact iPhone SE sales, Popal added. Some consumers might instead opt for older iPhone models with bigger screens in the same price range.
The M1 Ultra is made by connecting two M1 Max chips and is eight times faster than M1 chips. Its first use will be in the creative professional-focused Mac Studio computer.
Apple will offer two versions of the Mac Studio, one with the M1 Max chip and the other utilizing the M1 Ultra chip.
Mac Studio pricing starts at $1,999 for the version with the M1 Max chip and $3,999 for the M1 Ultra loaded computer. 
Apple also debuted a new monitor called Studio Display that can be paired with any Mac, including Macbook Air and Macbook Pro models, and which is priced at $1,599. 
Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) were about flat for the day in mid-afternoon trading.
The company which has been broadening its services and other products also said its Apple TV+ product would begin showing Major League Baseball games on Friday nights. The weekly double header will be available in eight countries. 
The new iPad Air gets its first refresh in two years with a new design, 5G connectivity and the M1, popular in MacBooks. The starting price remained $599 and it will be available starting March 18.
The new iPad Air also features a 12-megapixel front camera. 
Apple also announced new iPhone 13 models in two new finishes, including alpine green.

During the presentation, Cook made no mention of the conflict in Ukraine. Apple said on March 1 it had paused all product sales in Russia in response to the Russian invasion. The Russian state media, RT News and Sputnik News are no longer available for download from the Apple Store outside Russia.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation.”

""For sure growth is for me the overall priority,"" Gobbetti said in his first conference call with analysts since he took the role, adding he would give more details on his strategy in May when Ferragamo reports first-quarter results.
The leather goods maker, which has been without a creative director since May after parting ways with British designer Paul Andrew, swung back to profit in 2021, posting earnings before interests and taxes of 143 million euros ($156 million). 
That was above an operating profit of 112 million euros expected on average by analysts. In January, Ferragamo had already reported a rise in sales of more than 30% for last year, though revenues were still far below pre-pandemic levels, underperforming most other luxury groups, which have largely exceeded 2019 results.
The COVID-19 pandemic hit hard Ferragamo, more exposed than rivals to travel spending, just as the family-owned firm strived to rejuvenate a brand famous for making shoes for Hollywood stars such as Audrey Hepburn.

The group said it ""does not deem appropriate to provide guidance for the current year"" due to the persistence of the pandemic in certain regions and the geopolitical implications of the conflict in Ukraine, even though its direct exposure to Russia is less than 1% of sales.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 08:41PM ET</span>","Global shares fall, oil rises in volatile trading after Russia oil ban","By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global share markets fell on Tuesday as oil prices climbed yet further, driven by the United States banning Russian oil and other energy imports over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. President Joe Biden made the announcement on Tuesday, while Britain said it would phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022. 
Benchmark Brent crude for May rose to an intra-day high of $131.27 a barrel before settling at $127.98 a barrel, 3.9% higher, while U.S. crude futures settled at $123.70 a barrel, a 3.6% increase.
Russia, which ships 7 million to 8 million barrels per day of crude and fuel to global markets, has been the target of Western sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24.
Russia calls its actions a ""special operation,"" and it said earlier this week that prices could surge to $300 a barrel and it could close the main gas pipeline to Germany if the West blocked its oil exports. 
Jason McMann, head of geopolitical risk analysis at Morning Consult, called the U.S. ban noteworthy, but said the ""real show-stopper"" would be Europe banning Russian energy imports. 
""Given Europe's relatively high dependence on energy supplies from Russia, such a move, if it materializes, would have major economic and geopolitical ramifications,"" he said.
The news added to volatility in the markets and stoked fears of inflation rising as European and other economies cooled.
The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 50 countries, fell by 0.8% as of 5:40 p.m. ET (2250 GMT).
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 184.74 points, or 0.56%, the S&P 500 lost 30.39 points, or 0.72% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 35.41 points, or 0.28%. The STOXX 600 was down 0.51%. 
Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer in the Americas for UBS's wealth management arm, said the increase in oil prices over the past week - the second-biggest jump in 30 years - is likely to stick, causing continued market volatility.
""The Russia-Ukraine war has driven oil prices up faster than we previously expected, but we continue to see a tight supply-demand balance for crude oil globally, even if the hostilities end and the geopolitical risk premium attached to crude declines,"" Marcelli said.
Gold held near record highs on Tuesday, after investors made a beeline for the traditional safe-haven metal on mounting fears around the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Spot gold dropped 0.1% to $2,050.97 an ounce. 
The London Metal Exchange (LME) halted nickel trading on Tuesday after prices doubled in just hours to a record $100,000 per tonne, fueled by a race to cover short positions. 
UBS Global Wealth Management recommended a neutral stance on equities and advised clients to hold commodities, energy stocks and the U.S. dollar as portfolio hedges in the short term.
The rally in oil and other commodities has heightened investor fears about global inflation. Data this week is expected to show the U.S. consumer price index climbed a stratospheric 7.9% on a year-on-year basis in February, up from 7.5% in January.
Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that the European Union plans as soon as this week to jointly issue bonds on a potentially massive scale to finance energy and defense spending.
The news pushed up both the euro and the yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes. The euro bounced back from a 22-month low against the dollar, which it hit the previous session, and was last flat against the dollar at $1.0899. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was up 11.2 basis points to 1.861% after hitting a two-month low on Monday.

The dollar index fell 0.082%. 
Investors are carefully watching a European Central Bank policy meeting on Thursday. The prospect of stagflation has prompted economists to suggest policymakers might delay rate hikes until late in the year.

LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - Investors managing $2.4 trillion are calling on  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to take tougher climate action, including cutting its exposure to fossil fuel assets.
""The message from investors is clear: Credit Suisse must urgently back its long-term net-zero ambition with robust fossil fuel disclosures, policies, and targets,"" Jeanne Martin, senior campaign manager at ShareAction, said in a statement.
The 11-strong group, which includes Europe's biggest asset manager Amundi, said Switzerland's second-biggest bank also needed to improve its climate disclosures, align its coal, oil and gas policies with best-practice and set short-term targets to cut fossil fuel-related lending.
The group, which includes the municipal pension fund for Credit Suisse's home city of Zurich and the Swiss federal pension fund, said it was submitting a resolution to Credit Suisse's annual general meeting (AGM) on April 29.
If taken to a vote, the resolution, coordinated by responsible investment NGO ShareAction and Swiss pension fund adviser Ethos Foundation together with the Swiss Association for Responsible Investments, would be the first climate-related vote to be put to a Swiss company at its AGM.
Credit Suisse said it was engaged in dialogue with shareholders and would outline reductions to its oil, gas and coal financing in its sustainability report on Thursday.
""Credit Suisse's sustainability position is clear,"" the bank said in an emailed statement. ""We have made a public commitment to achieve net zero across our operations, supply chain and financing activities by 2050."" 
Interim targets include monitoring the reduction of both emissions and lending exposure to the oil, gas and coal sector.
The resolution follows the retraction of one at last year's AGM calling for the phasing out of coal financing.
Credit Suisse published a new coal policy at the COP26 climate talks in November.
The investor group said that policy had ""several concerning loopholes,"" including allowing the bank to keep funding companies for ""energy transition"" purposes without a clear definition of what that meant.

Credit Suisse had a torrid 2021, with scandals prompting executive oustings, a full-year loss and a strategic overhaul. A recently created sustainability division was folded back into its business units under new leadership.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -A New York state judge on Tuesday said Smartmatic can pursue its $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit claiming that Fox News Network, Rudolph Giuliani and others falsely accused the electronic voting systems maker of helping rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election to favor Democrat Joe Biden.
Justice David Cohen of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected bids by Rupert Murdoch's Fox Corp, anchor Maria Bartiromo and former anchor Lou Dobbs to dismiss Smartmatic's claims against them.
Cohen also said Smartmatic can pursue some claims against Giuliani, who worked as a lawyer for former Republican President Donald Trump. He dismissed all claims against Fox host Jeanine Pirro and former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell.
Smartmatic accused the defendants of turning it into a ""villain"" by fabricating a story that its technology helped Biden steal the 2020 election from Trump.
The Florida-based company said Fox News did this to boost ratings, cater to Trump supporters, and avoid losing viewers to smaller, right-wing networks Newsmax and One America News.
Smartmatic said it provided technology for the election only to Los Angeles County, which Biden won.
Without ruling on the merits, Cohen found a ""substantial basis"" for the claim that Fox News ""turned a blind eye to a litany of outrageous claims about [Smartmatic], unprecedented in the history of American elections, so inherently improbable that it evinced a reckless disregard for the truth.""
In a 61-page decision, Cohen said Giuliani's ""barrage"" of criticism, including that Smartmatic fixed elections in Venezuela and was up to its ""old tricks"" on election night, justified letting some claims against him proceed.
But the judge said an alleged misstatement by Pirro was not defamatory, and he lacked jurisdiction over claims against Powell.
Another company, Dominion Voting Systems, is pursuing similar litigation. A Delaware judge refused in December to dismiss its $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News.
In a statement on behalf of the Fox News defendants, the network said it planned to appeal the Smartmatic decision, calling the company's claims ""baseless.""
Fox News also said it planned to file a counterclaim for fees and costs ""to prevent the full-blown assault on the First Amendment which stands in stark contrast to the highest tradition of American journalism.""
Powell's lawyer Howard Kleinhendler said his client was ""confident that any subsequent litigation by Smartmatic or others will reach the same result."" Lawyers for Giuliani did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Smartmatic's lawyer J. Erik Connolly said Fox News caused ""catastrophic damage"" to his client's business and reputation. ""This lawsuit will help to undo that damage,"" he said.
The case is Smartmatic USA Corp et al v Fox Corp et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 151136/2021.

Several foreign companies including Ford and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) have announced temporary shutdowns of stores and factories in Russia in order to put pressure on the Kremlin to stop its invasion of neighbouring Ukraine and as their supply chains are disrupted.
In a statement published on Monday evening on the United Russia website, the secretary of the ruling party's general council Andrei Turchak said shutting operations was a ""war"" against the citizens of Russia. 
The statement mentioned Finnish privately owned food companies Fazer, Valio and Paulig as the latest to announce closures in Russia. 
""United Russia proposes nationalising production plants of the companies that announce their exit and the closure of production in Russia during the special operation in Ukraine,"" Turchak said.
""This is an extreme measure, but we will not tolerate being stabbed in the back, and we will protect our people. This is a real war, not against Russia as a whole, but against our citizens,"" he said.
""We will take tough retaliatory measures, acting in accordance with the laws of war,"" Turchak said.
Paulig Chief Executive told Reuters in an email this would not change its plans to withdraw from Russia. Fazer and Valio did not wish to comment when contacted by Reuters. 
Fazer, which makes chocolate, bread and pastries, has three bakeries in St Petersburg and one in Moscow, employing around 2,300 people.

Valio has a cheese factory and employs 400 people in Russia, and Paulig has a coffee roastery and employs 200 people in the country.
Last week, non-NATO member Finland, which shares a border with Russia, agreed to strengthen security ties with the United States as it nervously watches Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

(Reuters) -Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Tuesday asked a federal judge to terminate his 2018 agreement with the top U.S. securities regulator requiring some of his tweets to be vetted by a lawyer.
Musk also asked the judge to block a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) subpoena requesting records of pre-approval of a Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) poll he conducted in November on potentially selling some of his stock.
""The SEC's pursuit of Mr. Musk has crossed the line into harassment, which is quintessential bad faith,"" Musk's lawyers wrote to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan.
Musk's lawyers said the 2018 consent decree resolving SEC securities fraud charges should not allow ""roving and unbounded investigations"" into the outspoken government critic, while impeding his constitutional right to free speech.
Legal analysts said Musk's push to end the consent decree may fail.
""The SEC clearly has authority to enforce a consent decree issued by a federal court without having to conduct a new investigation,"" said Urska Velikonja, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
""Apart from concerns that the consent decree is overbroad and difficult to enforce, which seem plausible, Musk's other legal arguments are an exercise in legal silliness,"" she added.
UPHILL FIGHT
In early November, Musk posted on Twitter that he would offload 10% of his Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stake if users approved.
A majority did, and the poll sent Tesla shares into a slump. Musk has since sold $16.4 billion of stock. 
The tweet renewed questions about whether Musk complied with his SEC agreement to obtain approval from a Tesla lawyer before issuing written communications about information material to his company or its shareholders.
Tesla said on Tuesday that Musk's tweet on stock sales ""is behavior the SEC should encourage: a CEO's transparency with the public and shareholders about a proposed stock sale."" 
Musk faces a ""real uphill fight,"" according to Stephen Crimmins, a partner at Murphy & McGonigle in New York City.
""Courts generally give the SEC a lot of leeway to enforce subpoenas,"" said Crimmins, who is not connected to the Musk case.
""Judges generally take the approach that if you agree to a consent decree, you're stuck with it. Saying you don't like the deal is not going to get you out of it.""
The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
MICRO-MANAGING MUSK
The regulator sued Musk after he tweeted in August 2018 that he had ""funding secured"" to potentially take his electric-car company private at $420 per share.
In reality, a buyout was not close.
Tesla and Musk settled by agreeing to each pay $20 million in civil fines and let lawyers vet some of Musk's communications in advance, including Twitter posts that could affect Tesla's stock price. Musk also gave up Tesla's chairmanship. 
""I never lied to shareholders,"" Musk told Nathan in a separate court filing. ""I entered into the consent decree for the survival of Tesla, for the sake of its shareholders."" 
In his filing, Musk said he was ""forced"" to sign the decree, citing the SEC's ""unrelenting regulatory pressure"" and as the ""SEC's action stood to jeopardize the company’s financing.""
He said Tesla's investor relations teams said at that time that several large shareholders ""could cede their ownership in Tesla - substantially impacting Tesla's financing - if the case was not settled expediently.""
The company on Tuesday accused the SEC of exploiting the consent decree to ""micro-manage Mr. Musk's Twitter activity"" and retaliate against him for criticizing the agency. 

Musk has also mocked the agency in his tweets since the 2018 probe: ""SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon's.""
He also tweeted in 2020 that Tesla would make short pants in radiant red satin with gold trim and send them to the SEC, which he called the ""shortseller enrichment commission.""

Losses accelerated into the end of Tuesday's up-and-down session, a day after steep declines that saw the tech-heavy Nasdaq confirm it was in a bear market. The benchmark S&P 500 fell for a fourth straight session.
U.S. President Joe Biden announced the ban on Russian oil and other energy imports, underscoring strong bipartisan support for a move that he acknowledged would drive up U.S. energy prices, while Britain said it would phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022.

The energy sector, a standout performer this year, continued its charge higher, rising 1.4%. 
Brent crude topped $130 per barrel along with other commodities, triggering alarm over surging inflation and the impact on global economic growth. U.S. gasoline prices hit a record on Tuesday.

""I think we will see a little pullback in the U.S. consumer. Obviously, the gasoline prices are going to cause people to pause a little bit.""
Ukraine's government accused Russian forces of shelling a humanitarian corridor that Moscow, which describes its actions as a ""special operation"", had promised to open to let residents flee the besieged port of Mariupol.
Stocks have struggled as concerns about the Russia-Ukraine crisis have deepened a sell-off initially fueled by worries over higher bond yields as the Federal Reserve is expected to tighten monetary policy this year to fight inflation. 
On Monday, the Nasdaq confirmed it was in a bear market, falling over 20% from its record high, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average confirmed it was in a correction as it closed more than 10% lower from its record peak.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 06:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive-French auditor questions SoftBank's accounting at Pepper robot developer,"By Sam Nussey
TOKYO (Reuters) - An auditor has questioned SoftBank's bookkeeping at the French unit that designed its Pepper robot, documents show, casting doubt on the Japanese firm's treatment of a subsidiary it is now trying to sell as the venture has floundered.
The French auditor, in a report seen by Reuters, expresses doubt about the treatment under which the local unit of SoftBank Group Corp's robotics business, according to two people familiar with the matter, booked losses and did not pay tax.
Specifically, the 196-page July report by auditor Cabinet Boisseau, which has not been previously reported, questions SoftBank's decision to treat its Paris-based robotics business as having a high level of autonomy for accounting purposes.
The report says this treatment is ""clearly debatable"", citing the local company's ""extremely limited"" ability to make its own decisions. It does not accuse SoftBank of legal wrongdoing, draw specific conclusions about the company's French tax liability or say the firm sought to avoid tax. 
The auditor was hired by staff representatives at SoftBank Robotics Europe amid tensions with management over the direction of the company, the two sources said. French law required SoftBank to pay for and cooperate with the audit. 
""Cabinet Boisseau's reasoning is based on assumption and does not accurately reflect the facts,"" SoftBank said in a statement to Reuters. 
The auditor's report sheds light on the troubled relations between Tokyo and Paris at SoftBank's robotics business, which is best known for the wide-eyed Pepper android that group founder Masayoshi Son once touted as being the first personal robot that can read emotions.
Cabinet Boisseau took particular issue with SoftBank's decision to designate Paris-based SoftBank Robotics Europe as the ""main entrepreneur"", meaning residual profit and loss from the robotics business accrued to the French unit, the auditor said.
Under the scheme, the two sources told Reuters, SoftBank Robotics Europe booked losses for years and did not have to pay tax.
The report says ""the risk of fraud cannot be ruled out"" due to SoftBank's failure to share with the auditor its response to a 2018 government tax audit and a lack of clarity about the unit's accounting designation. The report does not detail any potentially fraudulent behaviour.
""SoftBank Robotics Europe operates with a high degree of autonomy, and both SoftBank Robotics Europe and SoftBank Robotics Group have paid taxes appropriately in each country, have properly conducted all tax audits, and have dealt with tax authorities with responses and interviews,"" SoftBank said in the statement. 
In SoftBank's view, the accounting designation was justified because the French unit took the main role in the development, production and sale of the robots and bore the main risks, according to the report, which cites internal documents. 
""Deloitte, an independent accounting firm, has appropriately conducted our audit in recognition of Cabinet Boisseau's conjecture, which forms the basis of the article, and has not changed its conclusion,"" SoftBank said in its statement.
Deloitte said it does not comment on client matters as it is bound by a statutory duty of confidentiality. Phone calls to the French tax authorities went unanswered. Cabinet Boisseau did not respond to requests for comment. Staff representatives of SoftBank Robotics Europe declined to comment, citing confidentiality.
SHORT CIRCUIT 
SoftBank acquired the French business in 2012 as part of Son's ambition to revolutionise commercial robotics. That dream has all but short-circuited, and the Japanese tech investment firm is in talks to sell the company to Germany's United Robotics Group, Reuters has reported.
United Robotics declined to comment on the outlook for the talks.
A sale would mark SoftBank pulling back at one of the few businesses it is still directly involved in operating. The Japanese firm has halted production of Pepper and slashed robotics jobs globally, Reuters has reported.
The auditor's report does not specify to what extent SoftBank's accounting contributed to losses at the unit.
The auditor says Japanese managers were prominent in making decisions at the French unit, Japan was the largest market for the robots and Tokyo had a direct relationship with the company that assembled the robots, Taiwan's Foxconn.
French management recognised that Japan called the shots, telling staff representatives in one meeting that Pepper production numbers were ""imposed"" by Tokyo, in a ""unilateral decision"", the report says. 
The report refers to the French business developing other robots including the humanoid Romeo, which was a research project begun in 2009 looking at helping people with reduced physical autonomy, and a food-serving robot, Plato.
After SoftBank bought another robotics business, Boston Dynamics, it told the French unit to suspend work on legs for Romeo as Boston Dynamics had its own walking robot, Atlas (NYSE:ATCO), the report says.
But there was never any meaningful collaboration between the two companies, the two sources said. In the end, Romeo never got legs, they said.

""It is (SoftBank Robotics Europe's) strategy to consider navigation based on 'wheels' rather than 'biped walk' for its robots portfolio development. Romeo was a European collaborative project that has been duly completed with all partners,"" SoftBank said.
Boston Dynamics declined to comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc defended the safety benefits of its advanced driver assistance system Autopilot and its Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability but acknowledged they require ""constant monitoring and attention of the driver.""
Democratic Senators Richard Blumenthal and Ed Markey wrote Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk on Feb. 8 raising ""significant concerns"" about the electric-car maker's Autopilot and FSD systems which have prompted scrutiny from safety regulators.
In a previously unreported March 4 letter to the senators, Tesla's senior director, public policy and business development Rohan Patel, said the features enhance the ability of its customers ""to drive safer than the average driver in the U.S.""
Patel noted that both systems ""require the constant monitoring and attention of the driver."" Tesla vehicles are capable of performing ""some but not all of the Dynamic Driving Tasks"" that can be performed by human drivers, he added.
Tesla says on its website that Autopilot enables vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically and ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.""
Blumenthal and Markey said in a statement to Reuters the letter was ""just more evasion and deflection from Tesla. Despite its troubling safety track record and deadly crashes, the company seemingly wants to carry on with business as usual.""
Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Patel said in the letter that Tesla ""understands the importance of educating owners on the capabilities of Autopilot and FSD Capability.""
Autopilot allows drivers to keep their hands off the wheel at times but Patel said its torque-based hands-on-wheel detection helps ensure drivers remain attentive.
Tesla launched a test version of its FSD system more than a year ago, enabling its vehicles to navigate city streets. Tesla has expanded the FSD deployment to 60,000 users, sparking criticism that it is risking safety by testing its technology with untrained drivers on public roads.

The automaker faces a number of investigations. The senators said in their letter the ""complaints and investigations paint a troubling picture: Tesla repeatedly releases software without fully considering its risks and implications, creating grave dangers for all on the roads.""
Under pressure from regulators, Tesla in January agreed to recall about 54,000 U.S. vehicles to revise software to prevent vehicles from disregarding stop signs.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A senior Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) executive said on Tuesday the company had no current plans to offer a streaming option that included advertising but declined to rule it out in the future.
""Never say never,"" CFO Spencer Neumann said when asked if the company would change its long-standing position that its service should remain ad-free, adding ""it's not something in our plan right now.""
Some Wall Street analysts have urged Netflix, the world's largest streaming service, to develop a lower-cost tier with advertising to boost revenue. The company's pace of new subscribers has slowed in recent quarters, and Netflix shares have fallen nearly 43% this year. 
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co on Friday announced it would offer an ad-supported streaming option for Disney+, joining AT&T (NYSE:T)'s WarnerMedia, Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and others trying to attract customers who are willing to watch commercials to avoid paying a monthly fee.
For Netflix, ""it's not like we have religion against advertising,"" Neumann said at the  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Technology, Media & Telecom Conference.
But he said the company was focused on building its current business for customers who want to watch movies and TV shows without commercials. ""We think we have a great model, a subscription business that scales globally really well,"" Neumann said.
""It's hard for us to ignore that others are doing it, but for now it doesn't make sense for us,"" he added.

Neumann also said Netflix viewed this year as a ""learning year"" for its venture into mobile games. The company has offered 14 games to subscribers so far.
""This is something I hope is a big part of our business in a decade,"" he said. ""It is not going to be a big part of our business in the next 12 months.""

""MongoDB delivered exceptional fourth-quarter results, highlighted by delivering 85% Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) revenue growth and surpassing $1 billion in annualized revenue,"" said Dev Ittycheria, president and CEO of MongoDB.
He added: ""Our success is being driven by the fact that our modern application data platform dramatically reduces friction in the development process to make it incredibly easy for developers to build compelling applications that create a competitive advantage."" 
Looking ahead, the company sees revenue for the first quarter between $263 million and $267 million with an adjusted loss per share in a range of 12 cents to 8 cents.

Investing.com – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) wrapped its first product event Tuesday with a number of announcements including a new budget iPhone that some bet will drive new user adoption, boosting sales by 30 million units from launch.   
Apple is hoping that is better that the new budget iPhone can spur a supercycle of iPhone sales just like the iPhone 12 SE did in 2020.  The ‌iPhone 12‌ lineup achieved 100 million sales within seven months of its launch.
“This past fall we've added more new users to the iPhone 13 line-up than in each of the previous five launches and we're excited for the iPhone SE to build on this momentum,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said Tuesday.
Some on Wall Street also share the tech giant’s confidence that the launch of the budget iPhone - equipped with 5G and Apple's latest A15 bionic chip - will prove difficult for consumers to pass up.
“Overall, with the A15 chip this smartphone will be the fastest and most powerful phone at these price points by a wide margin and we believe based on our initial supply chain checks should translate into 30 million+ iPhone units out of the gates for this product launch,” Wedbush said following the event.
The new iPhone at $439, is $30 more expensive than its predecessor, raising some concern as to whether the price tag could prove a stumbling block to user adoption. Pre-orders starting Friday, March 18.
Wedbush said, however, that the “modest” price hike was reasonable given the supply-chain costs faced by the tech giant, and wasn’t likely to impact demand.
“In a backdrop of massive supply chain shortages and inflationary pressures, a modest increase is not surprising and should not impact overall demand in our opinion,” Wedbush added.
Apple also announced the Mac Studio, Apple's latest addition to the Mac lineup, starting at $1,999 with the M1 Max and $3,999 with the M1 Ultra. A new M1 Ultra chip was also unveiled as well as a new iPad Air, and two new colors for the iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13. "
1481,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 04:14PM ET</span>","Apple Gadgets, Russian Oil Ban, Google Deal: 3 Things to Watch","By Sam Boughedda
Investing.com – Stocks rode up and down in a volatile session after President Joe Biden announced the U.S. will ban imports of oil and energy products from Russia.
The U.K. also said it would phase out imports of Russian oil and other energy products by the end of the year, Reuters reported.
The price of oil rocketed past $130 a barrel for the international benchmark Brent and gasoline prices at the pump in the United States are at record highs above $4 nationally. In some locations, gas prices are as high as $6 a barrel and climbing.
Biden has promised American voters he would try to get a handle on rising prices that are crimping household budgets.
 The U.S. and allies agreed to release a total of 60 million barrels from their strategic oil reserves – half of that to come from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But rising gasoline prices may make Biden’s clean energy promise more difficult to sell, at least in the near term.
Stocks have been on a roller coaster ride this year amid an escalating crisis in Ukraine brought on by the invasion of Russia. Since late February, a growing list of Western companies have pulled their business from Russia, including on Tuesday McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. New Apple gadgets
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its newest version of the iPhone SE with its latest mobile processor and 5G capability on Tuesday and people will likely still be talking about it this week. The tech giant said the latest edition of its entry-level iPhone will include the ""toughest glass on a smartphone"" and starts at $429, with pre-orders starting Friday, March 18. The new SE will also have the advanced features of Apple's latest A15 bionic chip.
2. Oil ban from Russia
The U.S.’s unilateral move to ban Russian oil imports adds to a raft of global sanctions already imposed on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. European allies may be too dependent for now on Russia, particularly for its natural gas, to institute similar action. Biden acknowledged that European allies might not yet be in a position to join the U.S. in this extra step to exert pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin. But stay tuned for news from EU.
3. Google cybersecurity deal
Not to be overlooked was Tuesday’s deal by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Google to acquire cybersecurity company Mandiant for approximately $5.4 billion, which could inspire a chain of similar deals. Google will pay $23 per share for Mandiant in a move it says is to protect against risks facing its Google Cloud customers. Mandiant will join Google Cloud once the deal goes through.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed lower Tuesday, after swinging between gains and losses as investors weighed up the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict in the wake of the U.S. announcing a ban on imports of Russian energy.
S&P 500 fell 0.70%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.56%, or 184 points, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.28%.
“We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday. “That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports…”  The embargo will ban new shipments of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal imports to the U.S. 
Oil prices jumped sharply, pushing U.S. gas prices to record highs and exacerbated concerns that inflation pressures will remain elevated and dent economic growth.
The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate rose to 2.876%, pointing to bets on inflation averaging 2.9% a year for the next decade.
Industrials, meanwhile, were led higher by surge in  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and a rebound in airline stocks.
Caterpillar jumped more than 7% after Jefferies upgraded its rating on the industrial equipment maker to buy from hold and raised its price target to $260 from $215, as the stock has historically been a strong inflation hedge.
Airline stocks, which have come under pressure amid concerns about rising jet fuel costs, rebounded from a slump a day earlier.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) were up more than 5%.
Technology stocks struggled to hold onto gains after turning positive intraday, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ending the day more than 1% lower.  
At its product launch event, Apple rolled out a new budget iPhone, an update to the iPad Air and an updated Mac chip, which will used in the new Mac Studio computer. Wedbush has estimated the new budget iPhone could rack up 30 million sales over the next year. 
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) bucked the trend lower, rising 0.6% after agreeing to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant in a deal worth $5.4 billion. The acquisition is expected to bolster cybersecurity for Google’s cloud customers.
On the earnings front, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) reported quarter-results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 2% higher.
In other news,  DISH Network  (NASDAQ:DISH) rallied 5% after UBS upgraded the stock to buy from neutral on expectation that the company's spectrum assets are undervalued.
""Questions remain regarding DISH's wireless business model, but we believe DISH's network build protects the company's spectrum licenses, whose value serves as a backstop,"" UBS said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rate hike cycle that started last year and low valuations had already made Latin America a darling destination for investors in 2022, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is likely to keep cash flowing to the commodity-exposed region.
The risks are country-specific, and mostly coming from electoral exposure or a further spike in inflation, analysts said.
Latin American stock markets measured in dollars are outperforming larger economies by close to 25 percentage points this year, with MSCI's Latam index up 11% YTD while the developed world index is down close to 13%.
So far this year, foreign flows to Latam stock and bond portfolios totaled about $18 billion through February, while the rest of EM pulled in a net $7.5 billion.
The Ukrainian invasion, dubbed a ""special operation"" by Moscow, has heightened risk aversion across emerging Europe but could add to the ongoing outperformance from Latin America. 
""Amid all the current volatility, Latin America may have some opportunities. Some markets may be positively impacted by higher commodity prices, and also by a higher volume of investment flows by Emerging Market portfolio managers,"" said Alfonso Eyzaguirre, CEO of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Latin America and Canada.
He added that investment restrictions in Russia, Ukraine and neighboring countries can increase Latin America's weight in emerging market portfolios.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced a ban on Russian oil and other energy imports and a barrel of oil hit this week its highest price since mid 2008. 
Regional currencies have also performed better this year. The four best-performing across emerging markets against the dollar are from Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Chile. Alongside spikes in the price of oil and food, the currency moves have added to the regional tailwind.
""The main impact on Latin America is coming via commodity price moves – this seems to have supported currencies like the Brazilian real and Colombian peso. Insofar as there are clearer beneficiaries from these commodity price moves, it’s the oil exporters like Colombia."" said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
""But there will be a cost across the region from higher commodity prices – it’s likely to lift inflation, and central banks are likely to hike interest rates more aggressively.""
The rate hike cycle that started in Latam ahead of a hawkish turn from the Federal Reserve has also boosted bond performance in relative terms.
Even as sovereign and quasi-sovereign spreads have widened across EM, emerging markets in Latin America have seen a 72 basis point widening this year, while Asia is wider at 92 bps, Africa at 161 bps and Europe at 778.
""My overall view that if you're a long-term fundamental bull it probably has to be Chile,"" said Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX at BK Asset Management.
""If you're looking for a short-term bounce, or a really strong reversal, it's Brazil. And Argentina has a long-shot trade here on the commodity boom - it's so hated by everybody, and is basically so oversold, that there's little risk of downside at this point.""
He said Brazilian stocks, already up 7% in local terms YTD and near 20% in dollars, ""are going to be probably the most sensitive to the upside.""
But political uncertainty, as well as overall risk aversion, could get in the way of the region's outperformance.
Colombia's congressional election this weekend will give a clearer picture of the odds on the May presidential race, which so far points to a sharp move towards the left.
Similar expectations exist for Brazil's election in October, while Chile is set to ratify the re-writing of the constitution made by a majority center- and left-leaning convention.

""Latam remains a difficult region to allocate to structurally given several idiosyncratic risk events such as upcoming elections in Colombia and Brazil, domestic political tension in Peru and a re-drafting of the constitution in Chile,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts in a client note on Monday.
""In Mexico, the currency and local rates are likely to be negatively impacted by a more hawkish Fed and higher inflation pressures.""

(Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the world's largest retailer, will offer its Walmart Plus membership service free for part-time and full-time workers in the United States, it said on Tuesday, joining a growing list of retailer perks being offered in a tight labor market.
Walmart, the largest private employer in the United States, said on a blog post https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2022/03/08/walmart-unveils-new-spotify-promotion-and-rolls-out-free-membership-for-associates on its website that the scheme is available for workers employed at its stores, distribution centers and fulfillment centers. 
Walmart last September bumped up wages by at least $1 for 565,000 store workers ahead of the holiday season and earlier said it would cover 100% of college tuition and book costs for its associates.
Members of Walmart Plus, launched in September 2020, are offered unlimited free delivery, fuel discounts and no checkout lines, among other benefits, for $98 per year. On Tuesday, the retailer said it would also offer a six-month Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) Premium membership for new and existing Walmart+ members for free.
The service, touted as a rival to Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Prime subscription, reached more than 30 million subscribers in 2021, and the latest move could bring Walmart's 1.6 million-person workforce into its subscriber base.
Employers of all kinds are fast-tracking their hiring processes, expanding healthcare benefits and offering sign-on bonuses to lock in workers, particularly in retail, where job openings continue to outnumber applicants. 

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment remains 2.9 million jobs below its pre-pandemic peak, but signs are emerging that the tide may be turning after a strong recovery in hiring in February.
Walmart rival  Target  (NYSE:TGT) last month laid plans to spend $300 million more in the next year on improving wages and healthcare benefits and set a new starting wage ranging from $15 to $24 per hour for store and warehouse workers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Europe's economy is likely already in a recession as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the U.S. economy may not be far behind, which will likely prompt companies and consumers to look toward technology to lower costs, star stock picker Cathie Wood of Ark Invest said in a webinar on Tuesday. 
Wood, whose ARK Innovation fund outperformed all other U.S. equity funds following the coronavirus lockdowns in 2020 before stalling in February 2021, said that soaring oil prices should accelerate the transition to electric vehicles, while genomics companies should benefit as a form of cost-saving compared to existing forms of treatment. 
""The good news is that innovation solves problems,"" Wood said. 
Wood's optimism comes as her flagship ARK Innovation fund is down 38.6% for the year to date as high inflation saps investor appetite for the high-growth and low-revenue companies that are mainstays of her portfolio. Her largest position, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc, is down 32% for the year to date, while streaming company  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) Inc, another top holding, is down nearly 52% over the same time.
The benchmark S&P 500 is down 11.8% for the year to date. 

The shock of high gas prices may prompt the Federal Reserve to back off its plan to raise interest rates repeatedly this year, Wood said.

(Reuters) -Rivian Automotive Inc has been sued by a shareholder who claimed the startup failed to tell investors it had underpriced its electric vehicles, leading to unpopular price hikes that it swiftly rolled back.
In a complaint filed on Monday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, shareholder Charles Larry Crews said Rivian concealed how its R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck were so underpriced that it needed to raise prices soon after its November initial public offering.
Crews said the increases ""would tarnish Rivian's reputation as a trustworthy and transparent company,"" and risk cancellation of a large number of 55,400 preorders dating back to 2018.
He called the rollback, including an apology from Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe, a ""futile attempt at damage control.""
Rivian did not immediately respond on Tuesday to requests for comment. 
The proposed class action came after Irvine, California-based Rivian sparked a customer backlash, including on social media, on March 1 by raising the R1S's price to $84,500 from $70,000, and the R1T's price to about $79,500 from $67,500.
Rivian backtracked two days later, saying customers with existing preorders would not face the higher prices, and customers who had canceled orders could reinstate them.
""It was wrong and we broke your trust in Rivian,"" Scaringe wrote customers in a March 3 letter. Rivian cited inflation pressures for the price increases.
The Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).com-backed company went public at $78.00 per share on Nov. 10, raising about $12 billion in the world's largest IPO of 2021.
Its shares closed Monday at $42.43, after losing 37% of their value in the prior five trading days.
Crews said he bought 35 Rivian shares on its first day of trading at $112.83 each, 45% above the IPO price.
In an email, his lawyer Jacob Walker said federal securities laws provide ""a very strong remedy"" for investors when companies omit key facts from IPO materials.

The lawsuit names more than 30 defendants including Scaringe and lead IPO underwriters Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
The case is Crews v Rivian Automotive Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01433.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 03:16PM ET</span>",Explainer-Will Big Tech cloud companies cut off Russia?,"By Danielle Kaye, Paresh Dave and Jeffrey Dastin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ukraine has urged cloud-computing and software giants including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and SAP SE (DE:SAPG) to cut off Russia to stop Moscow's invasion. Here's what's at stake.
WHAT IS UKRAINE DEMANDING?
The Ukrainian ministry of digital transformation wants North American and European technology companies to completely pause any dealings with Russian clients, potentially disrupting Russia's economy and forcing the Kremlin to reconsider what it has called a ""special operation"" in Ukraine.
Some companies like Microsoft have stopped accepting new customers in Russia since the invasion began last month. But many have not ended deals with existing customers, except for those targeted by new sanctions and export controls.
WHAT ROLE DO WESTERN COMPANIES PLAY IN RUSSIA'S IT SYSTEMS?
Russian companies and government agencies long have relied on technology developed by the West as the basis for their owned-and-operated IT systems. Servers from International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) Corp, Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) Inc and  Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co  (NYSE:HPE) top the market in Russia. 
Also popular are applications from SAP, Microsoft,  IBM ,  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM). The tools help organizations send emails, analyze data, store records and generally manage their operations.
Vendors cannot remotely turn off some of the technology. But there are options to choke clients' systems.
Banking, telecom, transport and other organizations in Russia could be hampered if vendors stop providing replacement parts, security patches, software updates and technical support, according to two former senior salespeople for IBM in Eastern Europe.
Clients could be forced to find alternatives, even pen-and-paper bookkeeping, if services go offline or degrade due to a lack of updates.
HOW WOULD A WESTERN CLOUD SHUTDOWN AFFECT RUSSIA?
Russian companies have been largely reluctant to rely completely on cloud services, especially from U.S.-based providers such as Microsoft Azure and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google Cloud, according to IDC analyst Philip Carter. As a proportion of overall domestic IT spending, cloud accounts for 5% in Russia compared with 19% in the United States, Carter said.
As a result, Russian companies dropped from the cloud would not be overly crippled, he said.
Still, the Russian cloud market has grown fast over the last two years, with the pandemic driving commerce online, according to researchers.
Microsoft has the largest market share in Russia at 17%, followed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s cloud unit at 14% and IBM at 10%, according to 2020 estimates from IDC.  Yandex  (NASDAQ:YNDX) NV, a Russian company, comes in fourth with 3% market share.
But IDC has said Russia and Ukraine combined only account for 5.5% of all information and communication technology spending in Europe and 1% worldwide.
WHAT HAVE THE WESTERN COMPANIES SAID?
Salesforce on Monday said it had began exiting its customer relationships in Russia, which it said added up to a small, non-material number. 
Other companies declined to comment on whether they are considering dropping existing clients. 
Amazon Web Services has said its biggest customers in Russia are companies headquartered elsewhere, and that it has had a long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government.
IBM and Oracle have said they suspended all business in Russia, and IBM added that it does not do business with Russian military organizations. HPE, Dell, SAP and Microsoft have said they are stopping sales. Google Cloud did not respond to a request for comment.
WHO COULD BENEFIT IF WESTERN COMPANIES BOW OUT?
Russian companies could turn to homegrown workplace software such as MyOffice or local cloud providers including Yandex and ActiveCloud. Prices and quality may be less favorable, though, IDC's Carter said.

Blake Murray of research company Canalys said Chinese technology companies could fill the gap. Cloud providers include  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd . China-based Huawei Technologies Co Ltd last year opened a data center in Moscow to the Russian scientific and academic community.
Still, any use of Western components in their operations could complicate Russian sales under trade curbs the United States recently imposed.

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 03:08PM ET</span>",U.S. ride-hail drivers at career crossroads over record gas cost,"By Nivedita Balu and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Uber (NYSE:UBER) drivers are protesting on social media over record U.S. gasoline prices eating into their earnings just as the ride-hailing firm raised its profitability outlook, with some asking whether it was still worth getting behind the wheel.
U.S. retail gasoline prices hit an all-time of $4.173 on Tuesday after Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent the price of crude oil rocketing. The price per gallon is now around 60% higher than it was two years ago before the COVID-19 crisis.
""There is no driver that's not complaining about these high prices of gasoline,"" Sergio Avedian, a Los Angeles-based ride-hail driver, said in an interview with Reuters on Monday.
For Uber and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), driver discontent comes as the ride-hailing pioneers seek to turn the page on the coronavirus pandemic as customers return to in greater numbers.
""Our platform only works if it works for drivers, so we'll continue to monitor gas prices and listen to drivers over the coming weeks,"" Uber said in a statement.
Lyft said in a statement to Reuters that it ""cared deeply about the driver experience.""
Uber on Monday raised its first-quarter core profit outlook on faster-than-expected demand rises, with February ride-hail trips only 10% below the pre-pandemic 2019 level.
That demand recovery requires a greater influx of drivers, many of whom left the sector during the pandemic, while pain at the pump coincides with general price increases for anything from car loans to tires, piling further pressure on them.
CASH-BACK SCHEME 
Many drivers shared their frustration in private online forums, with some hanging up their car keys.
""It's just not worth me driving any longer,"" Andrea Golde, a driver near Columbus, Ohio, told Reuters, saying she drives part-time and barely broke even in recent weeks.
Uber said driver earnings remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels despite higher gas prices, adding that the number of active drivers in the U.S. and Canada has been relatively stable from January to February, with driver numbers increasing during the final week of February.
Both Uber and Lyft have entered a partnership with GetUpside, which offers cash-back programs for fuel purchases, in an attempt to ameliorate the situation.
GetUpside said it had seen more than two million transactions from Uber and Lyft drivers over the past eight months, who on average earn $0.10 per gallon in cash-back at the pump. It said registrations had increased in recent weeks.
Uber said more than 200,000 drivers had signed up.

Desperate drivers are also signing an online petition https://www.coworker.org/petitions/gas-prices-3 that urges Uber and Lyft to have passengers pick up the fuel tab.
While it was launched in 2018, the petition has gained momentum in recent weeks, with 500 of the nearly 6,000 signatures coming in this month, Tim Newman, campaigns director at Coworker.org, said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Cosmetics giant L'Oreal is temporarily closing its stores in Russia and suspending investments in the country, it said on Tuesday, joining dozens of Western companies pausing operations over the invasion of Ukraine.
""We strongly condemn the Russian invasion and the war in Ukraine, which is causing so much suffering to the Ukrainian people,"" the French company said in a statement.
L'Oreal's Russian business, which includes a production plant, accounts for a low, single-digit percentage of annual sales, according to the company.
Companies operating in Russia have faced political pressure to halt their activities in the country, which has been hit by sweeping sanctions from the United States, Britain and the Europe Union.
L'Oreal said it was fully aligned with the position of French and European Union authorities.
The world's biggest cosmetics firm, which owns the Lancome and Maybelline brands, said it was considering additional measures while seeking to take care of its 2,200 employees in Russia.
L'Oreal has 326 Ukrainian employees, the majority of whom remain in their country under what the company said were increasingly unbearable conditions.
""We are concerned for them and fear for their safety,"" L'Oreal said, noting that it was providing financial and psychological support.
The company is also donating 5 million euros ($5.4 million) to international and regional aid organisations as well as United Nations agencies providing humanitarian aid.
Leading international luxury companies LVMH, Hermes,  Kering  (PA:PRTP) and Chanel announced plans to temporarily shut operations in Russia last week.

French food multinational Danone said over the weekend that it was suspending investments in the country.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 turned positive Tuesday, but market moves were volatile as investors weighed up the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict in the wake of the U.S. announcing a ban on imports of Russian energy.
The S&P 500 rose 0.72%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.78%, or 267 points, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%.
“We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday. “That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at U.S. ports…”  The embargo will ban new shipments of Russian oil, liquefied natural gas and coal imports to the U.S. 
Oil prices jumped sharply, pushing U.S. gas prices to record highs and exacerbated concerns that inflation pressures will remain elevated and dent economic growth.
The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate rose to 2.876%, pointing to bets on inflation averaging 2.9% a year for the next decade.
Industrials, meanwhile, were led higher by surge in  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) and rebound in airline stocks.
Caterpillar jumped more than 7% after Jefferies upgraded its rating on the industrial equipment maker to buy from hold and raised its price target to $260 from $215, as the stock has historically been a strong inflation hedge.
Airline stocks, which have come under pressure amid concerns about rising jet fuel costs, rebounded from a slump a day earlier.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) were up more than 5%.
Technology stocks rebounded as recent slump in tech attracted dip-buying, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) turning positive. 
At its product launch event, Apple rolled out a new budget iPhone, an update to the iPad Air and an updated Mac chip, which will used in the new Mac Studio computer. Wedbush has estimated the new budget iPhone could rack up 30 million sales over the next year. 
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rose nearly 2% after agreeing to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant in a deal worth $5.4 billion. The acquisition is expected to bolster cybersecurity for Google’s cloud customers.
On the earnings front, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) reported quarter-results that beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending its shares more than 5% higher.
In other news, Dish Network rallied 7% after UBS upgraded the stock to buy from neutral on expectation that the company's spectrum assets are undervalued.

Leonardo said in December it had received two expressions of interest in OTO Melara, which produces naval and terrestrial cannons, and Wass, which makes torpedoes, and was waiting for binding offers.
Leonardo said at the time it wanted to focus on helicopters, aircraft and electronics for defence, adding OTO Melara and Wass could have better growth opportunities outside the group. 
Franco-German consortium KMW+Nexter Defence Systems (KNDS) and Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri have both expressed an interest in the two units.
But the Italian government, which controls both Leonardo and Fincantieri, wants to have a say in the deal, sources have previously said.
With Europe weighing the urgent need for closer cooperation on defence, Rome believes any choice over the future of the two units has to be part of a broader strategy.
In particular, Rome wants to have a role in an Europe-wide consortium for terrestrial military equipment, in which some of the assets of OTO Melara and Wass could be folded, a senior government official said. 
The official said negotiations to reach the government's goals were complex, and the current crisis made it difficult to pursue talks.

""The issue is suspended due to the war,"" one of the sources said, asking not to be named given that deliberations are private.
Leonardo declined to comment.

(Reuters) -European shares slipped on Tuesday, as the United States banned Russian oil imports, raising volatility and fears of global stagflation, and offsetting a recovery in financial stocks.
The region-wide STOXX 600 index ended a choppy session down 0.5% with technology, healthcare and the materials sector weighing. 
London's FTSE and the German DAX were flat, while the bank-heavy indices of Spain and Italy outperformed, rising 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively.
President Joe Biden announced a U.S. ban on Russian oil and other energy imports, ramping up a campaign against Moscow in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, while Britain said it would phase out imports of Russian oil and oil products by the end of 2022.
The European Union has so far refrained from a ban on imports given its dependence on Russian gas and oil and the possible inflation repurcussions.
While markets had priced in the bans to an extent, the crisis is fuelling worries about slower economic growth coupled with higher commodity prices and inflation, Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Private Bank, said.
Fears of a severe supply crunch sent crude prices soaring past $132 per barrel, boosting London-listed oil majors BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa) up 5.1% and 3.0% respectively. [O/R] 
Germany's DAX and Italy's MIB were confirmed as being in a bear market, or a decline of 20% or more from the most recent closing highs, on the prospect of a Russian oil import ban.
The STOXX 600 is down almost 15% so far this year, slipping from January's record highs as the Ukraine crisis has escalated.
""If there is a further escalation in terms of sanctions and you have an actual stopping in physical supply of gas to Europe, you can even be faced with rolling blackouts in the industrial sector,"" said Davide Oneglia, senior economist at TS Lombard.
Euro zone banks closed 2.5% higher after hitting a one-year low in the previous session. 
Most euro zone sovereign bond yields soared and a key gauge of market inflation expectations jumped to its highest level since late 2013 amid unease over rising price pressures two days before a European Central Bank meeting.

""We can deliver intelligence reports and people can make determinations of what's going on the ground, or on the sea, from our radar imagery,"" Greenley said in a Zoom interview. ""It's all about... doing the right thing and giving Ukraine the support that they need."" 
Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, made an appeal to the international community on Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) a week ago, asking for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data.
""We badly need the opportunity to watch the movement of Russian troops, especially at night when our technologies are blind,"" Fedorov said on March 1.
With the war in its 13th day, the main Russian assault force heading towards Kyiv has been stuck on a road north of the capital. But to the south, Russia has made more progress along the Black and Azov Sea coasts.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory.
In the SAR images, ""you can see groups of vehicles, you can see changes to buildings, you can see changes to bridges, you can see ships at sea through all weather conditions day and night,"" Greenley said.

The intelligence is communicated securely to Ukraine through Western-based commercial agencies or governments, he said. MDA received approval from the Canadian government on Friday to share the SAR images of Ukraine, Greenley said.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) -Shares in German utility Uniper gave up earlier gains to close flat after the group signalled an exit from Russia and wrote down its exposure to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, key areas of investor concern since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Shares in Uniper had soared as much as 9.1% earlier on the news, while Finnish parent Fortum, which holds 78% in Uniper, had gained as much as 6.9%. Shares in both firms closed virtually flat.
""We have to put our business on a new footing,"" Harald Seegatz, deputy chairman of Uniper's supervisory board, told Reuters. ""Security of supply is the highest priority.""
This includes pushing ahead with plans for a terminal to import liquefied natural gas in the German port of Wilhelmshaven, which Seegatz said could be available from the 2023/24 winter season if the government provides sufficient support and red tape is reduced.
Fortum and Uniper are heavily exposed to Russia, where they have 12 power plants with a combined power generation capacity of 15.5 gigawatts. Uniper also owns an 83.7% stake in Russian utility Unipro, which it intends to divest.
Their combined Russian generation assets as well as the 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) exposure to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline had a book value of about 5.5 billion euros, Fortum has said.
Berlin has halted the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would have doubled Russian gas flows to Germany, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"".
Unipro said late on Monday that it had initiated a sales process for its Unipro stake at the end of last year, although those plans were now on hold given recent events. They would be resumed as soon as possible, it said. Its stake in Unipro is currently worth 97 billion roubles ($770 million).
Sources told Reuters last year that Uniper has held talks with Russia's InterRAO about a potential deal involving Unipro which laid bare differences between the two parties about price.

1503,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 12:54PM ET</span>",Biden Is Banning Russian Oil. These Producers Could Fill the Gap,"(Bloomberg) -- Shale giants EOG Resources Inc (NYSE:EOG). and  Devon Energy  Corp (NYSE:DVN). are sitting on thousands of federal drilling permits, many of which could be used to produce oil from the prolific Permian basin as a U.S. ban on Russian oil increases demand for other crude.
EOG and Devon hold more permits than other company, according to a Bloomberg analysis of federal onshore permitting data, but neither plans to grow production beyond 5% even as U.S. oil futures top $120 a barrel and global markets face historic disruptions. That dissonance is at the center of tension between the U.S. shale industry — which argues it needs long-term government support before it can sustainably raise production — and the Biden administration — which says oil companies should use up the more-than 9,000 drilling permits they already have before asking for further concessions.
The war of words between the two has intensified as the U.S. moved to ban Russian oil imports in response to the nation’s invasion of Ukraine. U.S. producers “have 9,000 permits to drill now -- they can be drilling right now, yesterday last week, last year,” President Joe Biden said Tuesday. “They have 9,000 to drill onshore that are already approved. So let me be clear, let me be clear: they are not using them for production now.” The comments came a day after the American Petroleum Institute, the biggest U.S. oil lobby group, accused the administration of “ misusing facts” when it comes to federal leasing data.
READ MORE: Biden Called to Unleash Shale to Counter Energy Crisis
“Just because you have a lease doesn’t mean there’s actually oil and gas in that lease, and there has to be a lot of development that occurs between the leasing and then ultimately permitting for that acreage to be productive,” said Mike Sommers, chief executive of the API. 
But a review of federal drilling permits shows that half of unused onshore permits are for acreage in New Mexico’s Lea and Eddy counties, part of the Permian Basin that’s responsible for most of U.S. oil output. EOG held the most permits there, followed by Devon and Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY).
Devon and Occidental declined to comment. EOG didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The American Exploration and Production Council, a trade group representing EOG, Devon and others, pushed back on the notion that holding permits constitutes an obligation to drill. “This claim shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how exploration and production works,” said Anne Bradbury, chief executive officer of the association. And Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, speaking Tuesday at the CERAWeek by S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) conference in Houston, said that U.S. oil drillers can’t significantly expand production in the near term because of personnel shortages and supply-chain snarls.
READ ALSO: Devon CEO ‘Mystified’ Biden Doesn’t Reach Out to Talk Oil
Oil companies may believe it prudent to hold onto drilling permits now in case Biden — who campaigned on pledges to combat climate change, accelerate the transition into renewables and limit new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters — clamps down on drilling later. The administration initially halted oil and gas lease sales --a move later reversed by a Louisiana-based federal district court — and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management has yet to auction onshore oil leases under Biden. It is still issuing permits on existing leases, with nearly 4,000 authorized onshore last year, in line with recent, pre-2020 levels. And more of those leases actually have wells in production, according to Bureau of Land Management data cited by the industry.
There are barriers to ramping up output in Lea and Eddy counties. Oil produced on that side of the Permian tends to generate higher quantities of associated natural gas and water, which are more costly to dispose of in New Mexico, where air and water regulations are stricter than in Texas. 
Publicly-traded oil and gas companies are also trying to limit production growth and return more cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks after a decade of overspending burned investors. Oil CEOs have in recent weeks made clear that they want a nod from Biden before accelerating production, in part to give them cover with shareholders. 
“The energy industry doesn't have a permitting problem,” said Aaron Weiss, a deputy director at the Center for Western Priorities, which is conducting its own analysis of federal drilling permits. “It has a financing problem.”

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 12:11PM ET</span>",Oatly to emerge winner in 2022 plant-based peers' battle,"By Praveen Paramasivam
(Reuters) - Oatly Group (NASDAQ:OTLY) AB is expected to forecast strong sales growth for 2022 when it reports results on Wednesday as health-conscious consumers consistently turn to the company's plant-based milk, a contrast to the demand slowdown seen by Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND).
Many restaurants and retailers have partnered with Oatly in recent months to offer vegan options to customers. One of the biggest boosts has, however, come from a U.S. oatmilk supply agreement with  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). 
As a result, Wall Street's sentiment on Oatly has become more favorable than that on alternative meat maker  Beyond Meat Inc , which has seen its sales growth fizzle through the pandemic for a number of reasons.
""Beyond Meat has not meaningfully expanded distribution in the U.S. over the past year or so ... Oatly's sales growth is currently being driven by expanded distribution,"" CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said.
CONTEXT
Oatly is expecting to provide 85% to 90% of Starbucks oatmilk needs in 2022. Chief Executive Officer Toni Petersson said late last year performance of Oatly's oatmilk at the coffee chain exceeded expectations.
About 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20, according to U.S. National Library of Medicine's MedlinePlus, making alternative milk a must-buy product for many of them.
Oatly said in November it had opened its first production facility in Ma'anshan, China, just a few months after opening its first Asian factory in Singapore, signaling its margins would improve by bringing more production in-house. 
FUNDAMENTALS
Analysts project Oatly to record a near 58% increase in revenue for 2022, with loss also shrinking from 2021 levels. In contrast, Beyond Meat's revenue is expected to rise only 27%. 
Graphic: Oatly usurps Beyond Meat as Wall Street's alternative food darling: https://graphics.reuters.com/OATLY-RESULTS/xmvjoeqlbpr/chart.png 
Oatly has the second highest projected revenue growth among its food and beverage growth peers, only behind energy drink maker  Celsius Holdings  (NASDAQ:CELH) Inc, according to brokerage Piper Sandler.
Still, Oatly will need to overcome potential mechanical and automation issues during its production ramp up as well as broader supply-chain disruptions to ensure demand for its milk, ice cream and yogurt converts into sales.
Revenue for the fourth quarter is expected to rise 2% sequentially, despite recalling a few products and discarding less than one million liters of inventory due to a quality issue in November.
WALL STREET SENTIMENT

** Around 68% of analysts rate Oatly ""buy"" or higher, compared with just 10% for Beyond Meat.
** Oatly's current mean price target implies an upside of 136% to Monday's close, versus Beyond Meat's 25%.

(Reuters) -Alphabet Inc's Google is buying cybersecurity firm Mandiant Inc for $5.4 billion in a deal that could trigger a ""ripple effect"" as cloud rivals Microsoft and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also ramp up efforts to fortify the fast-growing business.
A shift to remote working during the pandemic, as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, has fueled a spike in cyberattacks and bolstered demand for security software, a market expected to more than double to $352.25 billion by 2026 from 2020, according to research firm Mordor Intelligence.
 Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), according to news reports, was also a suitor for Mandiant, which has emerged as a go-to for companies investigating cyberattacks, including recent breaches at News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. 
""This is just the beginning of what we're going to see in terms of cybersecurity acquisitions for all the big cloud firms,"" Jeff Pollard, principal analyst at  Forrester Research  (NASDAQ:FORR), said.
The deal will enhance Google's cloud computing business, which generates more than $19 billion annually, and beef up its security operations and advisory services.
Google's $23 per share offer represents a premium of about 53% to Mandiant's stock price levels before reports emerged of Microsoft eyeing a deal. Mandiant shares were down 3% in morning trading on Tuesday, while Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) edged up 0.5%.
Mandiant, which focuses on cyber-incident response and cybersecurity testing, became a standalone entity last year after acquirer FireEye (NASDAQ:MNDT) Inc sold its products business and the FireEye name for $1.2 billion to a consortium led by private equity firm Symphony Technology Group.

""The capital necessary for Mandiant to succeed as a standalone cybersecurity business was going to require an external entity or an acquisition,"" Pollard added. 
""It would have been really capital intensive for the company to compete with larger firms having a similar set of capabilities.""

China says Hong Kong must stick to ""dynamic zero"" COVID strategy
A top Chinese health official rallied embattled Hong Kong on Tuesday to stick with a ""dynamic zero"" coronavirus strategy and warned that the city's ""lifeline"" health system was at risk and the situation had to be turned around as soon as possible.
Hong Kong reported more than 43,100 new cases on Tuesday after the launch of an online platform for people to record infections in a surge that has seen the city suffering the most deaths globally per million people in the week to March 6, according to the Our World in Data publication.
China has championed the ""dynamic zero"" strategy that involves stamping out infections with strict mitigation measures as opposed to the approach adopted in other places of relying on high vaccination rates and moderate mitigation like masks in an effort to ""live with COVID"". [nL2N2VB099] 
Scientists identify new gene differences in severe COVID patients
Scientists have pinpointed 16 new genetic variants in people who developed severe COVID-19 in a large study published on Monday that could help researchers develop treatments for very sick patients.
The results suggest that people with severe COVID have genes that predispose them to one of two problems: failure to limit the ability of the virus to make copies of itself, or excessive inflammation and blood clotting.
The scientists said their discoveries, published in the journal Nature, could help prioritise the likely treatments that could work against the disease. [nL3N2VA2H9] 
COVID can cause brain shrinkage, memory loss - study
COVID-19 can cause the brain to shrink, reduce grey matter in the regions that control emotion and memory, and damage areas that control the sense of smell, an Oxford University study has found.
The scientists said that the effects were even seen in people who had not been hospitalised with COVID, and whether the impact could be partially reversed or if they would persist in the long term needed further investigation. [nL3N2VB144] 
Florida breaks with CDC, recommends no COVID vaccine for healthy children
Florida's top health official said on Monday the state would recommend against the COVID-19 vaccine for healthy children, breaking with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In announcing the move during press briefing convened by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the state's surgeon general Dr. Joseph Lapado cited studies that showed few COVID fatalities among healthy children and elevated risk among young boys receiving the vaccine of side effects such as myocarditis.

Investing.com --  Caterpillar  Inc (NYSE:CAT) rose over 7% Tuesday after Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold, increasing the price target to $260 per share from $215.
The analyst told investors in a note that his prior Hold rating reflected “constrained capex and ESG themes in both mining and oil and gas markets,” which account for around 40% of Caterpillar revenue.
However, the analyst now believes the “recent turmoil in Eastern Europe fundamentally reshapes global commodity markets, driving structurally higher pricing and after years of underinvestment capacity additions and supply diversification will be necessary in both mining and oil & gas sectors, though new projects will take time.”
Volkmann went on to say that he also sees Deere (NYSE:DE) outperforming as Russia will ""likely be mostly locked out of global commodity markets for the foreseeable future, and capacity for mined, energy and ag commodities will have to be expanded elsewhere to compensate.”
“To be clear, we don't expect much change in commodity market spending in the near- term,"" he explained, adding that they are pegging the company's earnings power at $25 per share ""over the next several years."" "

1513,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 10:42AM ET</span>","Winners take all: in some markets, Ukraine war sparks boom","By Tommy Wilkes and Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - From European banks to the Polish zloty, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has triggered massive price falls as well as a number of winners in assets that investors are racing to stock up on.
Commodity prices are soaring, defence stocks are benefiting from higher security spending pledges and emerging market investors are finding refuge in Latin America. With the world still awash with pandemic-era cheap cash, many assets are displaying eye-catching moves.
Below is a list of some of the winners. All price moves are since Feb. 24, the day of Russia's invasion. Russia calls its actions a ""special operation"".
COMMODITY SHARES
A 30% jump in oil prices since Moscow sent troops and tanks into Ukraine has turbocharged the shares of energy producers. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas index has risen 14%, and some individual energy companies have gained far more. 
Graphic: Commodity prices: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gkplgaqedvb/commod%20prices.PNG 
Russia's large role in metals has driven even bigger jumps in other commodities. 
It supplies about 10% of global nickel, and concern about Russian supplies and a short squeeze have sent London three-month nickel prices up four-fold since the invasion to a record above $100,000-a-tonne. That prompted the London Metal Exchange to halt trading on Tuesday.
Russia and Ukraine together account for about 29% of global wheat exports, and 19% of corn exports. Chicago wheat futures have jumped 40% to 14-year highs.
The S&P GSCI, a composite index of commodity sector returns, has risen 24% since Feb. 24 and stands 9% off record highs hit in 2008.
Commodity trading firms are booming too. Shares in Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) are up 15%, and in Archer-Daniels-Midland 13% higher, while agribusiness  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) has gained 11%. 
COMMODITY CURRENCIES
Currencies of commodity-exporting nations are outperforming. 
The Australian and the New Zealand dollars are up nearly 1% since the invasion. 
Those moves are striking because both currencies typically struggle when global market sentiment deteriorates and traders tend to scramble for safer assets, such as the Swiss franc and U.S. dollar, which are also strong. 
Graphic: G10 FX performance: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/mypmnxqrgvr/fx%20performance.PNG 
The Norwegian crown, lifted by rising prices of Norway's major export, oil, has risen 2.7% versus the euro.
Emerging market currencies tend to weaken in the face of a robust dollar, but those of resource-rich South Africa and Brazil have also performed well. 
SUN AND WIND
The S&P Global (NYSE:SPGI) Clean Energy Index has gained 14.6% since the invasion on a bet Western countries will push harder to wean themselves off fossil fuels.
Wind energy suppliers Nordex and Vestas Wind have risen around 50%. Citi reckons many European companies could see sharp revenue upgrades if Germany meets its wind energy expansion plans.
Invesco's Solar ETF has climbed 31%. 
DEFENCE AND CYBER
Manufacturers of jets, missiles and radar are big gainers after several European countries, notably Germany, pledged to spend more on defence.
Since Feb. 24, arms companies dominate the list of the top-performers in the MSCI World index, led by 60%-80% gains for German military sensor maker Hensoldt and armoured vehicle manufacturer Rheinmetall.
U.S. firm Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) - the manufacturer of Stinger missiles that Western allies are dispatching to Ukraine - is up around 15%.
The SPDR S&P Aerospace and Defence ETF is 11% higher. 
Graphic: Defence ETF: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/zdpxokjzqvx/Pasted%20image%201646746894016.png 
The Global X Cybersecurity ETF, which includes Check Point Software Technologies (NASDAQ:CHKP) and Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), has gained 9%. 
""Cyber is one of our preferred long-term themes and that's been borne out further with this crisis,"" said Kiran Ganesh, at UBS Global Wealth Management. 
He said many sustainably-focused investors usually exclude defence shares but ""it's a debate the industry needs to have... many would argue that security is a social good too.""
INTO LATAM
Investors are heading into Latin American markets, commodity-heavy and more insulated from the Russian fallout than other emerging markets.
Data from the Institute of International Finance shows Latin American markets received $8.7 billion of investment inflows and Asian emerging economies took in $6.8 billion over February. 
Graphic: Latam stocks: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/lgpdwaqyyvo/Pasted%20image%201646747493067.png 
The MSCI Latin America index is higher versus pre-invasion levels, while its materials sub-index has jumped 16% since Feb. 24.
""The commodity factor - whether agri commods or metals is supporting capital flows to LatAm,"" said Jeremy Schwartz, chief investment officer at asset manager WisdomTree.
INFLATION PROTECTION
As the commodity surge threatens to lift inflation even further, inflation-linked bonds have proved a winner, especially in the euro zone where they have returned 7% since the invasion, BofA's index shows. 

The rally is most dramatic in short-dated 'linkers' with the yield on Germany's two-year issue down 190 basis points since the invasion.

Investing.com -- Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) intends to acquire cybersecurity company Mandiant Inc (NASDAQ:MNDT) in a deal worth approximately $5.4 billion, the company announced Tuesday. 
Google will pay $23 per share for Mandiant in a move it says is to protect against risks facing its Google Cloud customers. Mandiant will join Google Cloud once the deal goes through.
""The acquisition of Mandiant will complement Google Cloud’s existing strengths in security,"" Google stated.
Mandiant — founded in 2004 — is publicly traded. Its shares are down 3.4% Tuesday after a 16% gain Monday following initial reports of the deal.
“Organizations around the world are facing unprecedented cybersecurity challenges as the sophistication and severity of attacks that were previously used to target major governments are now being used to target companies in every industry,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud. 
“We look forward to welcoming Mandiant to Google Cloud to further enhance our security operations suite and advisory services, and help customers address their most important security challenges,"" he added.
If the deal gains approval, it will be Google’s second-largest acquisition behind its $12.5 billion deal for Motorola Mobility in 2012.
Google's parent company Alphabet Inc has declined 0.2% Tuesday."

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Qantas Airways Ltd expects airfares will need to rise to cover the cost of higher fuel prices as its oil hedging contracts expire, its chief executive said on Tuesday.
Qantas has hedged 90% of its fuel needs through the end of June and 50% in the following quarter, Chief Executive Alan Joyce said. 
""(Hedging) gives us time to react to that higher fuel price,"" he said at a conference hosted by The Australian Financial Review. ""If we stay at these levels, airfares are going to have to go up.""
Oil prices, which touched 14-year highs on Monday, see-sawed on Tuesday as the United States considered acting alone to ban Russian oil imports rather than teaming up with allies in Europe.
Qantas shares were steady in afternoon trade on Tuesday, following an 8% fall on Monday.
Joyce said based on current oil prices, Qantas would need to raise revenue per available seat kilometre - an industry measure mixing fares and the percentage of seats filled - by 7%.
""Seven percent is not massive but it will have an impact on some levels of travel out there,"" he said.
Joyce said domestic leisure travel demand had recovered to pre-pandemic levels, but business travel demand was lagging.

Demand for international flights was strong in key destinations, with demand for tickets between Australia and London and Australia and Los Angeles higher than before the pandemic, he said.
Jefferies analyst Anthony Moulder said in a note to clients that Qantas was well positioned to raise fares and to slow capacity additions in response to higher oil prices.

ANA said on Tuesday the carrier, Air Japan, would fly mid-range international flights to Asia-Pacific destinations, without disclosing planned routes. ANA already has a separate low cost carrier (LCC), Peach Aviation, which flies domestic routes as well as to a handful of short-haul Asian destinations.
The launch plan comes as airlines around the world have been hammered by the collapse in international travel triggered by the pandemic, and are now grappling with uncertainty and higher fuel costs sparked by the crisis in Ukraine. 
Air Japan will fly to destinations more than four hours from its base at Tokyo's Narita airport to differentiate itself from Peach, said Hideki Mineguchi, Air Japan President, speaking during a news conference.
""The new brand (Air Japan) is a new model that combines the best aspects of full service and LCC in terms of offering affordable prices,"" Mineguchi said. The carrier didn't disclose details but said Air Japan customers will be able to pay more for some services on top of the ticket price.
The carrier would rebrand Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 airplanes with around 300 seats that ANA has used for international flights.
 Target  (NYSE:TGT) customers would be families and students in Asia who want to visit Japan, as well as those who live in Japan wanting to travel to Asian countries on a budget once the pandemic is over, Mineguchi said.
Air Japan had been aiming to commence services by the financial year beginning next month at the earliest, but was forced to delay the start due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Japan Airlines founded its low cost carrier for mid-range international travel, Zip Air, in 2018.
The launch plans comes amid signs the outlook for tourism is brightening in Asia.
The Indonesian resort island of Bali this week welcomed its first foreign tourists under relaxed coronavirus rules that don't require quarantine, similar to programmes already in place in Thailand and the Philippines.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Russia faces further economic sanctions, as European officials prepared to meet on Tuesday to debate new restrictions, and more investors withdrew from the country.
The European Commission has prepared a new package of sanctions against Russia and Belarus designed to hit additional Russian oligarchs and politicians and three Belarusian banks, three sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
The draft sanctions were adopted by the EU executive early on Tuesday and will be discussed by EU ambassadors at a meeting later in the day, one of the sources said on condition of anonymity.
The package, provided it is endorsed by the ambassadors, will ban three Belarusian banks from the SWIFT banking system and add several oligarchs and Russian lawmakers to the EU blacklist, the sources told Reuters.
They said the package also proposes bans on exports of naval equipment and of software from the EU to Russia and gives guidance on the monitoring of cryptocurrencies to avoid their use to circumvent EU sanctions.
At the same time, lenders and investors have continued to cut their ties with Russia, with British asset manager and insurer M&G the latest to describe the country as uninvestable.
The company's Russian assets have been marked down to almost zero, and CEO John Foley said it had no plans to buy more.
""Russia is an uninvestable market from a ratings perspective. Any additional investment is clearly unthinkable,"" he said.
Britain's finance ministry has met asset managers to explore how the sector could offload holdings in Russian companies that face sanctions, the Investment Association said on Tuesday.
Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said he believed Britain's insurers and the wider financial sector would be able to absorb the impact of sanctions. 
Britain has banned Russian companies from the multi-billion dollar aviation and space insurance market, and some Russian banks are being sanctioned and disconnected from SWIFT. 
""We looked very carefully at whether we think these are manageable in terms of any collateral damage or impact on the UK financial services sector, and so far we are comfortable that they are,"" Woods told an upper house committee.
Ukrainian civilians began leaving two besieged areas on Tuesday after Russia opened ""humanitarian corridors"" for them, but Kyiv said Russian forces had shelled an evacuation route from the port city of Mariupol.
Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, describing its actions as a ""special military operation"". 
Since then, at least five commercial ships have been hit by projectiles and London’s marine insurance market has widened the area of waters around the Black Sea and Sea of Azov that it deems high risk.
The euro zone banking share index made a 6.3% gain, as it recovered from 13-month lows on Monday.
Bank stocks had fallen sharply as investors prepared for the conflict's economic cost, with lenders with operations in Russia - including Austria's Raiffeisen, Italy's UniCredit and France's Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) - the hardest hit.

They staged a double-digit rebound on Tuesday. Raiffeisen gained 13% and Unicredit (MI:CRDI) and Societe Generale 10%, recouping some of their earlier falls.

""The markets are extremely treacherous at the moment,"" Troy Rohrbaugh explained at an investor conference. ""There is a lot of uncertainty. There are a lot of clients that are under extreme stress. That creates potentially very significant counterparty risk exposure.""

Acer in December filed a lawsuit in the U.S. state of Virginia against Volkswagen, German newspaper WirtschaftsWoche reported at the time, alleging that Volkswagen had infringed on its patents for 4G mobile chip technology in its cars.
The carmaker has paid for licences for 2G and 3G patents, but has been using 4G technology in its cars for the past two years without the appropriate licence, Acer claimed.

In order to settle the dispute, Volkswagen struck an agreement for 4G patents with patent pool Avanci, a consortium of companies which cross-license patents relating to a particular technology, also used by Mercedes-Benz and BMW as well as Volkswagen's brands Porsche and Audi.
Acer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) -The British franchisee of pizza chain Domino's is expecting more cost inflation this year and has hedged itself against wheat prices which have soared in response to the conflict in Ukraine, it said on Tuesday.
Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) Group Plc, a franchisee of U.S.-based Domino's Pizza Inc, sources its wheat from the UK and Germany, and is hedged against wheat price inflation for the majority of 2022, Chief Executive Dominic Paul said in an interview.
Russia and Ukraine account for 29% of the world's wheat exports and their conflict has driven wheat prices to multi-year highs on supply concerns.
""We buy (wheat) in scale, which means we already have good, strong relationships with our key suppliers,"" Paul said. ""I think we are better able than most to mitigate some of those inflationary pressures.""
The chain was already hedged against wheat price inflation prior to the Ukraine conflict, and has continued that strategy, Paul said.
Domino's Pizza also unveiled a 46 million-pound ($60 million) share buyback programme. It reported a 12.5% higher annual profit, helped by a marketing campaign that boosted post-lockdown sales.
The company's media and TV ad campaign, targeting families and friends reuniting after coronavirus lockdowns, as well as England reaching the final of soccer's European Championship in July, helped boost orders, Domino's said.
The pizza company also said 2022 earnings should fall in line with current market expectations, adding that its first-quarter trading had ""started well"". 
Shares of Domino's were down 2.6% at 340 pence by 0910 GMT. 

Elsewhere, popular British baker and fast food chain Greggs said costs of raw materials, energy and staff wages were rising more significantly than it had expected, and that this would limit any material profit growth in 2022.

The Alpine badge, with which Renault hopes to boost margins, is about specific accessories, including blue seat topstitching and a new satin shale grey body colour.
Luca de Meo, head of the French car manufacturer, said he wanted to exploit the Alpine brand's sporty image, as he seeks to fuel Renault's profit margin recovery, but not restrict it to a few exclusive models, as has been the case in the past.
Renault hopes to continue increasing the average selling price of its vehicles with the launch of the Austral, which is set to succeed the Kadjar SUV.

The Austral also reflects the carmaker's offensive on the compact and mid-size vehicles segment - the largest in Europe - where it plans to launch seven new models by 2025.
The new car, will be manufactured in Renault's major hub for hybrid vehicles production in Spain, will be marketed from the fourth quarter of this year.

PARIS (Reuters) -French food group Danone targets 3-5% annual sales growth over three years and will step up investment in its brands and part with non-performing assets under a fresh strategy outlined by new chief Antoine de Saint-Affrique on Tuesday.
Saint-Affrique, who took over as the chief executive of the world's largest yoghurt maker in September, must conduct his revival plan amid mounting input costs, coupled with further uncertainties caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has forced Danone to suspend investments in Russia.
Danone's brands include Activia yoghurt, Evian and Badoit water as well as Aptamil baby formula. 
The ""Renew Danone"" plan is ""all about creating the conditions for sustainable and competitive growth and then delivering consistently in a way that creates value for all,"" Saint-Affrique told investors meting in Evian, near the French Alps.
While ""there is nothing wrong"" with Danone's three businesses - dairy and plant-based products, infant formula and bottled water - the key to stoke sales growth was to improve execution, invest sufficiently behind worthy brands and innovation and part with underperforming assets in those businesses.
""There will be no sacred cows, there will be no taboos,"" Saint-Affrique said.
About 25% of Danone's sales come from businesses that were underperforming.""So, we will fix them or sell them,"" he added.
The Chinese water brand Mizone has been one of these challenged brands though it returned to growth in 2021. Danone was also looking at how to fix its business in Morocco.
Danone announced on Sunday that it is suspending investments in Russia following the country's invasion of Ukraine but would continue to operate its dairy and baby food business there. Saint-Affrique said it is working on plans to mitigate the impact of sanctions there and ""all options are on the table"".
MARGIN RESET FOR 2022
The food giant said it would reinvest all of the 700 million euros ($761.04 million) of Local First savings in 2022. It targets a productivity higher than last year's 5% and a low to mid-teens level of input cost inflation against 8% last year.
As a result, Danone expects its operating profit margin to decline to more than 12% of sales in 2022 from 13.7% in 2021, with like-for-like sales growth in a range of 3% to 5% against 3.4% in the year-ago period.
By 1409 GMT Danone shares were up 0.4%, having erased earlier losses.
""Announcement on the portfolio rotation is clearly good news. Guidance for 2022 is with no surprise despite the fact a part of the consensus will have to revise down,"" Oddo analysts said in a note. The consensus forecast a 2022 margin of 13.5%.
For the 2023-2024 period, Danone set a goal for ""profitable growth"" and said it targeted like-for-like sales growth between 3% and 5% with a recurring operating income growing faster than like-for-like net sales.
Under the plan, Danone will selectively expand in terms of segments, channels and geographies and seek bolt-on acquisitions and divestitures, with a portfolio rotation reaching around 10% of net sales and an annual capital expenditures enveloppe equivalent to up to 4.5% of net sales.

Saint-Affrique replaced Emmanuel Faber, who was abruptly ousted as chairman and CEO last year following clashes with some board members over strategy and calls from activist funds for him to resign over the group's lacklustre returns compared with some rivals.

1525,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 09:41AM ET</span>",Wall Street Opens Mostly Lower as Oil Ban Stops Overnight Bounce; Dow Flat,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mostly lower on Tuesday as the news of an imminent U.S. ban on Russian energy imports kept the financial cost of the Ukraine war at the front of the market's mind.
President Joe Biden is due to make an announcement at 10:45 AM ET on ""Actions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine"" according to a White House briefing sheet. Various reports indicate that Biden intends an immediate stop to U.S. imports of Russian crude, refined products and coal. 
The news sent crude oil prices back toward the $130 mark, a level that has only been seen once in the past, directly before the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. Soaring prices for other commodities, both industrial and agricultural, are fueling fears of sustained inflation and a global economic slowdown.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average had eked out a gain of 21 points, less than 0.1%, to 32,839 points. That follows a drop of over 2.3% on Monday. The broader-based S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.5%.
Precise details of the planned actions weren't immediately available. The measures are unlikely to bring about a total halt to Russian energy exports: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Monday that his country would continue to buy energy from Russia as there were no short-term alternatives available. The EU is set to outline a wide-ranging plan for a rapid reduction in its reliance on Russian energy later Tuesday, however.
The U.S. imported less than half a million barrels of oil a day on average from Russia in 2021, or less than one-tenth of what it imports from Canada and Mexico. However, Russia was the largest source of gasoline imports into the U.S. last year.  The news comes at a time when gasoline prices across the U.S. are at their highest ever (they averaged $4.17 a gallon on Monday, according to the American Automobile Association).
Among individual movers, Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock stood out with a 6% gain as investors encouraged by Monday's profit outlook upgrade took advantage of the shift in market momentum to buy the dip. The stock had hit a 19-month low during Monday's rout. 
Electric vehicle stocks also remained under pressure after extreme volatility in the nickel market illustrated the risks associated with shutting Russia - one of the the world's biggest producers - out of the market. Nickel is an essential metal for the current generation of batteries, and Monday's 80%+ rise in futures prices would put another couple of thousand dollars on the price of every EV if it were sustained. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock fell 0.3%, while Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock fell 1.7%. Lucid (NASDAQ:LCID) stock rose 0.4% but struggled to pull away from the record low it posted at the outbreak of the war."

Chesapeake, Virginia-based Dollar Tree, which is valued at roughly $31 billion, is expanding the size of its board to 12 people and is seating Richard Dreiling, a former Dollar General chief executive, as executive chairman. Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal will join the board as vice chair.
Five current directors, including the CEO, are staying and another five people independent of Mantle Ridge will also join. Dollar Tree is also adding a new finance committee and restructuring existing committees to create a new committee to focus on Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility.
""Dollar Tree has a powerful legacy to build on in the years ahead,"" CEO Michael Witynski said in a statement.
The settlement comes at a time when several retailers, including Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) are facing activist investors who are pushing management to consider alternatives including possible sales.
Mantle Ridge, which owns 5.7% of Dollar Tree's common stock and ranks as its third-largest investor, sought to take over the entire board when it nominated 11 directors in December, arguing that the company's stock price was lagging and to push for a review of the retailer's business strategy. 
Mantle Ridge has an economic interest of 9.85%, including 4.19% in cash-settled derivatives.
Dollar Tree's share price is roughly flat this year while the S&P 500 General Merchandise Stores Index has climbed 22%.
In premarket trading, shares climbed 1.5%, signaling investors welcome the settlement.
Dollar Tree traditionally sold items for one dollar but said last year that it would raise prices of most goods to $1.25 by
the end of April in the wake of spiraling freight costs and
other COVID-19 pandemic-driven challenges.

The retailer faced off against another activist investment firm in 2019 when Starboard Value urged it to consider raising its prices.
For Mantle Ridge's Hilal, this marks the third time he has won board seats at a target company since founding his firm in 2016. Both railroad CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX) and food services company Aramark appointed new chief executives soon after Mantle Ridge began pushing for changes.

(Reuters) - Levi Strauss (NYSE:LEVI) and Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL) are among U.S. apparel brands likely to be worst hit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine which is again clogging supply chains in Europe where they derive at least a quarter of sales, Wall Street analysts say.
American clothes firms' European businesses were just recovering from two years of pandemic restrictions. But war-related Western sanctions on Moscow, airspace bans and shipping route changes have put new squeezes on East-West supply chains. 
""Cargo checks are now one of the biggest disruptions to shippers, making sure they are not breaking sanctions at ports in the EU (European Union) and the UK,"" said Jane Hali, CEO of investment research firm Jane Hali & Associates.
Analysts see particular exposure to Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH (NYSE:PVH), Levi Strauss, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors owner Capri Holdings (NYSE:CPRI) and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), who get roughly 25%-40% of sales from Europe.

""Europe is definitely going to feel the brunt of the economic damage ... which will impact consumer sentiment and consumer wallets,"" CFRA Research analyst Zachary Warring said on the fallout for apparel retailers.
DOWNGRADES
Due to the war, Wedbush analysts have reduced yearly revenue growth estimates by anywhere from 100 to 400 basis points for Adidas AG (DE:ADSGN). and at least eight U.S.-based companies including Skechers USA (NYSE:SKX) Inc and Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) Ltd. 
The brokerage also downgraded ratings on PVH and Ralph Lauren's stock to ""neutral"" from ""outperform,"" while reducing Nike's price target.
Adding to sales pressures, numerous brands have also halted operations in Russia altogether in protest or because of the newly-difficult operating environment. Chinese manufacturers had been sending more goods to Europe by rail across Russia.

Companies with a smaller European presence, such as Carter's (NYSE:CRI) Inc, Bath & Body Works Inc and Kate Spade-owner Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) Inc, are likely to be more insulated, analysts said, but the challenge remains sector-wide. 
""We're afraid it won't just be retailers with high exposure to Europe but most of retail,"" CFRA's Warring said.

GM plans to build this new “premium import business” from the ground up and operate it with “a high level of autonomy,” GM said in a statement on Tuesday.
""Halo cars,"" as described by Blissett, refer to premium, often high-performance cars that have an edgy design.
“We are inviting talent from across the industry to join us and jointly create our brand-new business in China,” it said.
The U.S. automaker issued the statement after multiple Chinese media outlets reported this week about the new wholly owned brand.
According to a Shanghai-based GM spokesperson, Blissett told Chinese media outlets on Friday the new premium brand will specialize in selling upscale GM vehicles currently unavailable in China through its existing brands. Those brands include Wuling, Baojun, Chevrolet, Buick and Cadillac, all of which are owned and operated with Chinese joint-venture partners.

While Russian crude and gas has been exempt so far from Western sanctions, oil soared above $139 a barrel on Monday to its highest since July 2008 as the United States and European allies began to consider banning Russian oil imports.
U.S. lawmakers have called for bans but President Joe Biden's administration has only sanctioned Russian oil tankers. Britain and Canada have also barred Russian vessels from landing at their ports in protest at Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.
Shell (LON:RDSa) apologised on Tuesday for buying Russian oil last week after it had said it would pull out of its Russian operations, including the Sakhalin 2 LNG plant in which it holds a 27.5% stake and which is operated by Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
""We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil ... was not the right one and we are sorry,"" Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said.
Shell bought a cargo of Russian crude oil from Swiss trader Trafigura at a record low of dated Brent minus $28.50 a barrel, traders said on Friday.
British rival BP (NYSE:BP) said last month it was abandoning its 19.75% stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft in an abrupt move that could cost it up to $25 billion.
TotalEnergies Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said on Monday that the French company had stopped buying oil from Russia, although one its landlocked refineries in Germany continued to receive Russian crude by pipeline.
Shell said it would change its crude oil supply chain to remove volumes from Russia ""as fast as possible"" and shut its service stations in Russia, as well as its aviation fuels and lubricants operations in the country.

The company said the supply chain change could take weeks to complete and would lead to reduced output from some of its refineries while its withdrawal from Russian petroleum products, pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) would be phased.
The company also plans to end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany, which it helped finance as a part of a consortium.

Investing.com – Shell ADR (NYSE:SHEL) traded 1% higher in premarket Tuesday after the company decided to stop buying any crude or gas from Russia, saying it will withdraw completely from any involvement in the communist country’s hydrocarbons over its invasion of Ukraine.
The company had attracted much flak last week over buying a cargo of Russian crude. Faced with rising criticism then, it went on to commit its profits from any Russian oil purchases into a fund that will go towards humanitarian aid to Ukraine.
“We are acutely aware that our decision last week to purchase a cargo of Russian crude oil ... was not the right one and we are sorry,"" Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said.
Shell last week said it would exit all its Russian operations, including the flagship Sakhalin-2 LNG plant in which it holds a 27.5% stake, and which is 50% owned and operated by Russia’s Gazprom (MCX:GAZP).
But it was still one of the few Western companies to have continued buying crude oil from Russia since the conflict in Ukraine escalated.
Shell said it will, “as fast as possible,” change its crude oil supply chain to remove Russian volumes and shut its service stations, and aviation fuels, and lubricants operations in Russia.
The company also plans to end its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 Baltic gas pipeline linking Russia to Germany, which it helped fund as a part of a consortium.
Shell joins a growing list of companies shutting or curtailing their operations in the communist country. The list includes rival BP (NYSE:BP), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and  Nike  (NYSE:NKE)."

MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish law passed last year forcing food delivery companies to contract their couriers as staff has caused a labour shortage as many prefer to remain self-employed and work for rivals that flout the regulation, Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats said on Tuesday. 
The Spanish branch of Uber's online food delivery platform published on Tuesday an open letter to the Labour Ministry complaining that the contracts it offered to freelance 'riders' failed to retain enough of them to assure its services.
""Our fleets of collaborators can't find enough couriers because these prefer to be self-employed to work with Glovo,... the only company that allows it, against the Rider Law,"" Uber Eats said, referring to the May 2021 decree demanding firms grant formal work contracts to protect gig-economy workers.
A spokesperson for Glovo said the company, which has been taken over by Germany's Delivery Heros, did not break any law and said it had taken steps to ensure it complied.
The Uber Eats letter fuels a European controversy over the legal status of the thousands of cyclists who criss-cross city centres with oversized branded backpacks, and who generally lack benefits such as minimum wage, paid holidays and pension rights. 
The European Commission in December recommended other EU countries follow Spain's lead, a move that is long overdue, according to unions, but which firms say may lead to job losses. 
The Labour Ministry said it demanded all platforms abide by the new law. ""The majority of digital platforms respect this rule,"" the ministry said, without mentioning any names of firms that did not adhere to the rules.

The Spanish decree, backed by trade unions and business associations, was met with scepticism by several riders associations and labour experts who said the new legislation did not completely resolve the legal situation of the couriers.
Uber Eats said couriers preferred the flexibility to focus on lucrative rush hours they enjoy as self-employed than the better social protection work contracts offered, but which also came with requirements to work at other less lucrative times.

(Reuters) - Office rental company IWG said it would merge its digital assets with flexible workspace platform The Instant Group, as office space providers benefit from the hybrid work trend, sending the London-listed firm's shares sharply higher.
IWG's decision comes at a time when office landlords are slowly recovering as tenants reassess their options following the COVID-19 pandemic, including a shift to a permanent hybrid model, in which employees split work between home and office.
""We are merging our digital business with a company, which is serving the rest of the industry, to achieve a high growth rate and give more focus to the digital platform for the broader industry,"" IWG Chief Executive Officer Mark Dixon told Reuters in a interview.
Shares of IWG rose as much as 15% to 267.5 pence and the stock was among the top percentage gainers on the FSTE 250 index.
IWG's digital assets offer services including platforms to book office spaces, while the London-headquartered The Instant Group caters to the flexible workspace market, with presence in 18 countries globally.
IWG will invest about 270 million pounds ($353.65 million) to buy the stakes of selling shareholders, while The Instant Group's management will invest about 50 million pounds into the combined business, which is expected to be spun out by 2023-end through a listing either in the United States or UK.
The London-listed owner of the Spaces and Regus brands, IWG said it expected the deal to be earnings-accretive in the first full year of ownership.
Dixon said the consensus as of now was for a return to strong profitability in 2022.
The Switzerland-headquartered firm, which operates in more than 3,300 locations across 120 countries, posted a loss before tax from continuing operations of 259.4 million pounds for 2021, compared with a loss of 613.3 million pounds a year earlier.
The CEO said Ukraine and Russia account for only 7 million pounds each of the group's overall annual revenue of nearly 2.5 billion pounds, adding that its centres in the countries were operational wherever possible.

The company said it will take off all brand sites and shipments to its retailers in the country. The cosmetics giant had last week suspended business investments and initiatives in the country.
Estee Lauder gets roughly 2.7% of its revenue from Russia, according to a recent report by the Yale School of Management cited by The Wall Street Journal in its report on Estee Lauder’s decision.
The company has had a presence in Russia for more than 30 years and counted the country as one of its strongest performers in the most recent quarter, helping to offset volatility in the Chinese market amid Covid-19 lockdowns in the world’s second-largest economy.

MILAN (Reuters) -Italy's biggest utility  Enel  (MI:ENEI) is ready to dust off plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in southern Italy as Rome steps up its efforts to find alternative supplies to replace Russian gas.
The plan will form part of Italian efforts to wean itself off Russian gas. Italy aims to become independent of Russian gas imports within 24-30 months, Energy Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani said on Tuesday.
In comments to Reuters on Tuesday Enel said it would be useful for Italy to have two additional LNG terminals so as to be less tied to gas pipelines.
""For this reason, Enel has given availability to resume the Porto Empedocle LNG plant project, that is fully permitted,"" an Enel spokesperson said.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Italy has ramped up efforts to secure alternative gas sources, with LNG-rich Qatar a particular focus of attention.
Industry sources said to build a plant like Porto Empedocle in southern Sicily, originally designed to have a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres per year, could take more than three years.
""At the start of the year they had canceled this (Porto Empedocle) project because it was unsustainable. Now they've resurrected it,"" Sicily energy manager Daniela Baglieri told Reuters.
Italy’s byzantine permitting process has virtually stopped development of LNG facilities beyond the three plants currently operative and which now account for around 20% of daily imports.
RACE AGAINST TIME
Italy, which uses gas to generate some 40% of electricity, imports more than 90% of its gas needs with Russian piped flows accounting for around 40%. 
It has other pipeline connections to Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya and the North Sea. But while the pipelines are underused, analysts say the problem is the lack of gas to fill them because of chronic underinvestment in recent years.
World demand for gas could rise if sanctions against Russia are extended to include oil or Russia opts to cut supplies via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany.
Given the time needed to boost upstream gas production, Rome is keen to expand LNG infrastructure and is looking to find at least one floating terminal, or FSRU.
On Tuesday Cingolani said Italy planned to install a new FSRU by the middle of this year.
A source familiar with the matter said energy group Eni and gas infrastructure group Snam had been asked to help out on the logistics including looking for the FSRU to charter.
""Competition is hot. Italy, Germany and at least one other European country are in the market looking for FSRUs,"" the source said.
European countries are seeking to build LNG facilities to reduce their reliance on Russian gas. On Saturday Germany unveiled plans for a terminal.
Eni and Snam declined to comment. 

Snam, which runs most of Italy's gas storage business, has stakes in all three LNG terminals operating in Italy. Eni has an extensive worldwide LNG business.
The Italian state is the largest shareholder in Eni, Snam and Enel.

1538,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 06:51AM ET</span>",Carmakers face soaring metal costs with Russian supplies at risk,"By Nick Carey and Christina Amann
LONDON (Reuters) -Saving up for a new ride? Better start putting more cash aside.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine is ramping up the price of metals used in cars, from aluminium in the bodywork to palladium in catalytic converters to the high-grade nickel in electric vehicle batteries, and drivers are likely to foot the bill.
While metals have not been the target of Western sanctions yet, some shippers and autoparts suppliers are already steering clear of Russian goods, putting more pressure on carmakers already reeling from a chip shortage and higher energy prices.
""So what happens from here?"" asked Carlos Tavares, chief executive of Stellantis, the world's fourth-biggest automaker, when speaking to reporters last week. 
""First, what happens is that we have an escalation of cost that comes from raw materials and energy that is going to put more pressure on the business model,"" he said.
Aluminium and palladium both hit record highs on Monday while nickel, which is also used to make stainless steel, crossed the $100,000-a-tonne level for the first time ever on Tuesday.
Andreas Weller, chief executive of Aludyne, which makes aluminium and magnesium die-cast parts for automakers, said his European business has seen a 60% rise in the cost of aluminium over the past four months, as well as soaring energy bills.
With annual sales of $1.2 billion and a surge of costs in the ""hundreds of millions of dollars"", Weller, whose company is based in Southfield, Michigan, said he has been forced to ask customers to pay more than the prices already agreed.
""Some are more understanding and cooperative than others, but we cannot survive without that,"" Weller, who has four foundries and one machining plant in Europe, told Reuters. 
Stellantis chief executive Tavares said an end to the chip shortage could help carmakers offset higher metal and energy prices, but he did not expect any resolution to the semiconductor issues this year.
'WE QUIT'
Consumers are already paying for the chip shortage as it has pushed car inventories down and prices up - even before higher metals prices feed through to the forecourt.
According to consultancies LMC and J.D. Power, the average transaction price for a new vehicle in the United States was $44,460 in February, up 18.5% from the same month in 2021.
German carmakers such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and BMW have already been hit by Russia's invasion of Ukraine as it has forced makers of wire harnesses in the west of the country to halt production. A wire harness is a vital set of parts which neatly bundle up to 5 km (3.1 miles) of cables in the average car - and Ukraine is a key supplier.
And when it comes to metals, Russia companies are major suppliers to Germany. In 2020, they accounted for 44% of Germany's nickel imports, 41% of its titanium, a third of its iron, and 18% of its palladium.
With production of 108 million tonnes last year, Russia is the world's fifth-largest producer of iron ore, according to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN), supplying European steelmakers who now face higher prices and possible difficulties procuring the metal. Austria's Voestalpine and Sweden's SSAB are both exposed to this risk, according to U.S. investment bank JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM).
Voestalpine said it had enough inventory for the coming months, but expected it would have to source raw materials from other suppliers thereafter. SSAB did not respond to a request for comment about supplies from Russia.
Faced with the choice of buying Russian goods and indirectly funding Russia's invasion, which Moscow calls a special military operation, Germany steel and aluminium supplier Voss Edelstahlhandel has decided to draw the line. 
""Even though aluminium is not on the sanctions list, it is used by Russia to get money into the country and therefore we quit,"" Chief Executive Thorsten Studemund told Reuters. 
Russia is a big manufacturer of aluminium, the most energy-intensive metal to produce, accounting for 6% of global output.
'BATTERY MINERAL WOES'
Studemund's company has also been contending with high prices for nickel.
Caspar Rawles, chief data officer at specialist consultancy Benchmark Mineral Intelligence (BMI), said that while Russia accounts for 5% of global nickel production, it supplies about 20% of the world's high-grade nickel.
The metal is used to make batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), posing a fresh challenge for carmakers already investing billions to move away for combustion engines just as demand for zero-emission models is starting to take off.
Some of Russia's high-grade nickel will probably end up in China, which is unlikely to impose sanctions on Russia, but this all comes at a time when carmakers are facing rising bills for other EV battery minerals as demand outstrips supply.
""That's the main concern for the battery supply chain in that you've got record high lithium prices, and very, very high cobalt and nickel prices,"" Rawles said. ""This is just adding to battery mineral woes."" 
Batteries are one the most expensive components in EVs and automakers have been hoping they will become cheaper so they can offer more affordable electric cars.
BMW said it was focusing as much as possible on recycling battery nickel, with up to 50% scrap nickel used in the high-voltage battery of its new BMW iX model.
When it comes to palladium, carmakers are also in a bind.
The auto industry uses it in catalytic converters for gasoline models - or platinum for diesel models - both of which still make up the vast majority of car sales.
Palladium prices have been rising for about six years and Russia accounts for about 40% of the global market.
""There is no other option beyond palladium and platinum for catalytic converters, and you can't build a car without a catalytic converter,"" said Chris Blasi, chief executive of precious metals dealer Neptune Global.
He said he bought a lot of palladium in December at $1,940 an ounce. On Monday, it hit a record $3,440. 

Blasi estimated that the value of the palladium used in the average car is about $200, but that could easily double.
""Either consumers will pay more for cars, or if automakers can't pass it on they'll have to find cost savings somewhere else,"" he said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening higher Tuesday, stabilizing after the previous session’s sharp falls with investors remaining on edge as the war in Ukraine continues, pushing oil prices higher and potentially stunting global growth.
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was up 110 points, or 0.3%, S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 0.4%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 35 points, or 0.3%.
The main Wall Street indices slumped on Monday, with the blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average falling nearly 800 points or 2.4%, the broad-based S&P 500 dropping almost 3%, its biggest one-day decline in more than a year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6%.
The conflict in Ukraine, and the associated Western sanctions on Russia, have prompted concerns about supply shocks, sending commodity prices soaring to multi-year records.
The U.S. national average for gasoline surged to $4.104 per gallon on Monday, just ahead of the previous all-time of $4.103 per gallon in 2008, before the onset of the Great Recession.
These inflationary pressures are raising concerns that the Federal Reserve will have to hike interest rates more aggressively than the market has factored in, potentially stunting the recovery in the world’s largest economy and global growth driver.
The U.S. central bank meets next week, and Chairman Jerome Powell last week backed a quarter-point rate increase in his Semiannual Testimony to Congress, adding he would move more aggressively later if inflation didn’t abate.
Oil prices remain firm Tuesday, not far removed from the previous session’s 14-year highs. The latest weekly inventory report from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, is due later and follows a drop of just over 6 million barrels last week.
By 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.4% higher at $122.20 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2.9% to $126.77. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since July 2008 on Monday, with Brent hitting $139.13 a barrel and WTI $130.50.
In corporate news, Shell (LON:RDSa) will be in the spotlight after the oil major apologized for buying a consignment of Russian oil last week, and announced its intent to withdraw from the country.
Elsewhere, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) holds its first product event of the year later Tuesday, named ""Peek Performance"", which is expected to detail various product updates, including Macbook and iMac upgrades, and potentially an updated iPhone SE with 5G. 
AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) recorded its third-highest attended weekend since movie theaters reopened in the summer of 2020, while Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) reports quarterly earnings before the opening bell. 
Additionally, gold futures rose 1% to $2,016.60/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.3% higher at 1.0884."
1540,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 06:26AM ET</span>",Explainer-What's next for Purdue Pharma after $6 billion opioid settlement?,"(Reuters) - Members of the Sackler family that own Purdue Pharma struck a new settlement last week with a group of eight states and the District of Columbia to resolve widespread litigation accusing the OxyContin maker of fueling the U.S. opioid epidemic.
The following details next steps for Purdue and potential hurdles as it moves closer to exiting bankruptcy.
What is in the revised deal?
Under the new settlement, the Sacklers will pay between $5.5 and $6 billion to a trust that will be used to pay the claims of opioid creditors, including states, victims of addiction, hospitals, and municipalities.
The Sacklers have denied wrongdoing, but expressed ""regret"" that OxyContin played a role in the opioid crisis. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain must approve the settlement and will consider the matter at a hearing on Wednesday.
The deal replaces a previous $4.3 billion agreement, which was upended on appeal after nine attorneys general argued that the Sacklers should not receive sweeping protection from current and future opioid lawsuits as part of the deal. 
Does the settlement protect the Sacklers from future lawsuits? 
Not directly. 
The Sacklers have said in court testimony and filings that a settlement is predicated on them being shielded from opioid-related lawsuits.
But these sweeping legal protections must first be written into a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and approved by a bankruptcy judge. 
To do this, Purdue must overcome the December ruling concluding that the bankruptcy court did not have the authority to release non-bankrupt parties, like the Sacklers, from litigation. 
Purdue is appealing that decision to the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, and will make oral arguments in that court on April 25. Purdue filed its briefs on Feb. 11, and opposing papers are due on March 11.
Do creditors need to vote on the new deal?
Purdue may have to ask creditors to vote on the new settlement, even though they already voted to support the previous $4.3 billion deal. Purdue has argued that no one is worse off under the new deal and the bankruptcy judge could conclude that a new vote is not necessary. 
A new vote would be expensive and time consuming, and there is no guarantee that Purdue could maintain the broad support it achieved the first time around. 
Who might oppose the new settlement? 
The Department of Justice's bankruptcy watchdog has consistently opposed the use of bankruptcy law to grant the kind of sweeping legal protections sought by the Sacklers, who are not bankrupt themselves. The DOJ has opposed Purdue's appeal in the 2nd Circuit, and its written arguments are due on March 11.
The DOJ did not participate in the negotiations that led to the new Sackler settlement, and declined to comment when asked whether the agreement would change its position in the 2nd Circuit appeal.
Other states also could attempt to upend the new settlement before Tuesday's 7pm ET deadline. Other creditors, including individual victims, may also object.
Seventeen states, including Florida, West Virginia and Ohio, have already objected, saying in court papers that the latest Sackler settlement gives too much money to the states that negotiated it, through a $277 million ""side deal"" that will not be shared with other states.

The objecting states argued that they are receiving a lower percentage of the opioid abatement money than they would have under the $4.3 billion deal. The new settlement violates a bankruptcy principle that similarly-situated creditors must be treated equally, according to the states' objections. 
Other creditors may object as well, including individual victims of the opioid crisis, who will be given a platform to speak before the bankruptcy court approves the deal. A group of Canadian municipalities and tribes is also fighting Purdue's appeal in the 2nd Circuit.

Investing.com – Stocks of U.K.’s insurer and asset manager M&G (LON:MNG) surged 11.5% in London Tuesday after it revealed a 500 million pound ($654.30 million) share buyback offer to shareholders, supported by strong capital generation in the business.
The financial services firm will also pay a second interim dividend of 12.2 pence per share, taking the total for the year to 18.3 pence.
Plans to return more capital to the shareholders have come in after the life insurer achieved a total capital generation of 2.8 billion pounds over two years. The company, which split off from Prudential in 2019, is targeting the operating capital generation of 2.5 billion pounds in three years through 2024.
The firm’s operating profit in 2021 was 721 million, down 9%, but ahead of the forecasts. Changes in longevity assumptions hurt profit.
Banking and finance companies have had a good run in the last two years, even though 2021 was relatively volatile, while interest rates began to firm up. Most businesses grew, from lending to wealth management to advisory.
Total assets under management gained 0.8% to 370 billion pounds, mostly owing to a positive market. Net client inflows were 600 million pounds.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 05:56AM ET</span>","At the top of Europe's banks, it's still a man's world","By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi and Tom Sims
ZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Women remain rare visitors to the highest echelons of European banks.
The 25 biggest banks by assets have seen 22 changes in chief executive and chair over the past two years, including announcements of upcoming appointments, according to a Reuters review of senior industry roles. Twenty-one of those 22 jobs went to men. 
Only one lender - Britain's NatWest - has a female CEO, while two - Spain's Santander (MC:SAN) and the Netherlands' Rabobank - have a woman chairing their governing boards.
""Tim goes away, so who looks like Tim?"" said Claire Godding, the former long-time head of diversity for BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) in Belgium, citing unconscious bias as the prime culprit.
""It's usually not a Sarah.""
The review, on International Women's Day, provides just a snapshot of the industry, yet indicates how far banks have to travel to achieve equality at the top. 
It suggests that, while Europe is making progress in diversifying its C-Suite, it has fallen behind Wall Street in an area that could provide a competitive edge.
Some of the most stubborn obstacles to change revolve around the intangible working culture at institutions long dominated by men, such as bosses favouring staff who stay late, according to interviews with more than two dozen specialists including senior executives, board members, investors and academics.
There is a greater degree of diversity within European banks' wider executive teams, which typically comprise around 10-20 senior managers under the CEO. 
The review found that women make up about 25% of such teams. Yet the Europeans lag the eight U.S. banks with major global reach - including the likes of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) - where the proportion is 30% on average.
The data, collected by Reuters through early February, does not reflect pending appointments which will affect several lenders' gender diversity. Some banks said they already had female top managers lined up in the months to come.
At the European banks, the most common executive role filled by women was chief human resources officer, a job that industry experts say does not usually involve the level of operational experience that would feed into becoming a future CEO or chair. 
'ROOM SUDDENLY FELL SILENT'
Citigroup's Europe head Kristine Braden sees training as a crucial tool to make staff aware of the gender dynamics at play. 
""When I moved to EMEA, I became the first woman appointed to one of our executive committees. I remember walking into my first meeting and looking forward to meeting everyone,"" she said.  
""What had been a room full of cheerful banter suddenly fell silent."" 
    ""Men and women develop relationships in different ways. When a woman wants to establish rapport with another woman, she may compliment her in some way,"" Braden added. ""Men often banter with each other. Establishing professional rapport across the genders requires building trust with each other.""
Citi's CEO Jane Fraser, who made history when she became the first female chief executive of a Wall Street bank a year ago, credited work flexibility early in her career when she had young children as a key factor enabling her to rise to the top.
""That phase for me of being part-time working, but being able to be with the kids when they were very little, was very precious,"" Fraser told a conference shortly after being named new Citi CEO, referring to her time at consulting firm McKinsey. 
""I honestly don't think I would be here today if I hadn't.""
The equality drive goes beyond social justice.
""We see a lack of diversity as a lack of competitive advantage over time,"" said Stephanie Niven, Global Sustainable Equity Portfolio Manager at investment manager Ninety One. ""Broadening the voices in a room broadens the understanding and context of decision-making."" 
BOOST IN BOARDROOMS
Women are closer to parity on bank boards, partly a result of these supervisory panels being the main focus of governance scrutiny from policymakers and investors. The female representation is about 37% on both sides of the Atlantic.
""We vote on board members, so pressure is first on the board,"" said Vincent Kaufmann, director at proxy advisor Ethos. ""But I can imagine, once we've solved those problems, progressive investors will start focusing on management in coming years.""
Some of the industry figures interviewed cited the predominant focus on board diversity as one reason for the lack of progress in the C-Suite. 
""With that push for more women at the board level, I think there was an opportunity for women,"" said Simone Stebler, head of executive search firm Egon Zehnder's financial services and legal practices in Switzerland. 
""But there was also the demand for them to leave their management roles and step onto the board, sometimes even without having passed through this executive committee rank."" 
Globally, a 2021 study by finance think-tank OMFIF found that European commercial banks fared above-average on board-level representation but lagged peers in North America, Asia-Pacific and emerging markets at the executive committee level.
WHAT'S WITH THE CULTURE? 
Despite policymakers' efforts to reform banking culture, Europe's sector still rewards inflexible hours, which often favour men, according to many of the people interviewed. 
And an ""old-boys"" network of men helping each other get ahead in their careers is still alive and kicking, they said.
""Every year many talented women are leaving universities and schools - too few are visible after 10 or 20 years,"" said Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, a former member of the European Central Bank's executive board who is now on the supervisory board of Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG). 
Yet overhauling a company's DNA is a long-term endeavour, multiple interviewees said. Filling up a diverse candidate list for executive roles can take many years as it often relies on a pipeline of experienced middle managers.
""The easiest part is achieving gender diversity at board level, the more difficult part is actually at the second and third layers down in an organisation,"" said Gavin Rochussen, CEO at London-based fund manager Polar Capital.
Former BNP Paribas executive Godding, who now focuses on diversity at the Belgian financial sector lobby Febelfin, said some executives were not aware of the scale of the challenge. 
""Most banks discover they have two or three glass ceilings instead of one,"" she said. ""They lose women in the middle of middle management."" 
'FEEL IT IN THE BANK' 
UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel told Reuters that banks needed to change their mindsets.
""We take this commitment seriously, recognising that meaningful progress comes not from quotas but from establishing a fundamental change in culture within our business,"" he said. 
Elena Carletti, a finance professor at Bocconi University who joined UniCredit's board in 2019, believes meaningful change can happen quickly if the will exists, citing the progress made by Italy's second-biggest bank under Orcel and chair Pietro Carlo Padoan, who were both appointed last year. 
Of the 25 banks reviewed by Reuters, UniCredit has made the greatest senior executive-level progress since 2019, boosting women's representation from 4% to 40%.

Carletti said almost half the CEO's direct reports were women compared to one under his predecessor.
""The change has been dramatic, and you can feel it in the bank.""

KKR could confirm its interest in a deal but at a price of around 0.40 euros per share, Italian daily Il Messaggero reported. 
KKR made a non-binding approach to TIM in November which was pitched at 0.505 euros per share, valuing Italy's largest telecoms company at 10.8 billion euros ($11.8 billion).
KKR and Telecom Italia declined to comment on Tuesday. 
TIM shares, which have plunged over the past three sessions, were up 10.7% at 0.2614 euros by 0950 GMT against a 3% rise in Italy's blue chip index.
A board meeting to draw up a response to the KKR proposal could be held on Sunday once TIM's advisers complete an analysis to compare TIM's planned in-house revamp with KKR's plan, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Monday.
Ahead of their assessment this week, TIM's advisers have asked the U.S. fund to clarify whether the terms of its November offer still stand, the sources added.
The shares have remained well below the takeover approach as leading TIM shareholder Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY) had indicated it was too low. 
A big annual loss reported last week and a standalone plan that has so far failed to win over investors added to the pressure.
SPLITTING UP
TIM CEO Pietro Labriola's plan is centred around the structural separation of TIM's fixed-network business from its retail operations. 
Last week Labriola said that KKR's plan for TIM was similar but that he was convinced doing it internally could generate more value for investors, including minority shareholders.
Some members of TIM's board of directors have reservations about ditching KKR's proposal without further talks with the fund, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. 
Splitting TIM's wholesale network operations from its retail arm could ease a mooted merger of the former phone monopoly's fixed assets network with those of fiber optic rival Open Fiber, a move advocated by TIM second largest investor, state lender CDP. 

But a preliminary agreement on the plan failed to materialise so far, as Italy's Innovation Minister Vittorio Colao warned it could create regulatory problems with EU funded tenders to boost fast connectivity across the country, people familiar with the matter said.
CDP controls a 60% stake in Open Fiber. ($1 = 0.9180 euros)

Investing.com – Greggs PLC (LON:GRG) stock slumped 8.3% in London trading Tuesday after it flagged significant cost pressures in its bakery business, saying it does not expect “material profit progression” in the year ahead.
CEO Roger Whiteside told Reuters,  Greggs  was having to deal with raw material price increases ""right across the board, all food stuffs.""
“All the proteins, all the cereals, all the oils - everything's going up in price,"" Whiteside told the news agency.
Some 29% of Greggs' total costs are in food ingredients, labor being its biggest cost.
The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has sent prices of food grains and other farm-based commodities to multi-year highs. Crude prices are at their highest since 2008. Supply chains, which began to return to normalcy after the pandemic, are in turmoil again.
The price of wheat rocketed past $10 a bushel last week for the first time in more than a decade, according to Bloomberg. Corn also leaped to a nine-year high and soybean oil traded near record highs.
Russia and Ukraine account for about a quarter of global wheat and barley trade and a fifth of corn. Farming activity in Ukraine is in disarray as many farmers have rushed to perform military roles.
Whiteside said Greggs had raised prices for consumers at the beginning of 2022, but not since then.
In the year ended January 1, Greggs’ total sales rose 5.3% to 1.23 billion pounds. Pre-tax profit was near 146 million pounds compared to a loss last time."

“If people have used, or are using our technology to make a vaccine, I don’t understand why, once we’re in an endemic setting when there’s plenty of vaccine and there’s no issue to supply vaccines, why we should not get rewarded for the things we invented,” CEO Stéphane Bancel told The Wall Street Journal in an interview.
Notwithstanding any revised stance, Moderna is maintaining its previous pledge of not enforcing its Covid-19 vaccine patents in 92 countries that are part of an international program, called Covax, that provides Covid-19 vaccines.
These countries include South Africa, India, Afghanistan, Haiti, Indonesia, Rwanda, Vietnam, Egypt, and Algeria.
Moderna has been hailed for its mRNA-based Spikevax vaccine that has saved millions of lives. At one point, along with Pfizer-BioNTech and Russia’s Gamaleya, Moderna was the only other company in the world making Covid-19 vaccines. It decided to undervalue the price of its vaccine while the pandemic lasts.
In 2021, the company delivered 807 million doses of the only product it sells; a fourth of those went to low- and middle-income countries. The biotech firm expects $19 billion in sales of its Spikevax vaccine this year compared to the $18.5 billion it had forecast earlier."

Investing.com - European stock markets climbed in volatile trading Tuesday, but sentiment remains fragile amid ongoing concerns that the Russia/Ukraine war will hurt global growth by pushing commodity prices sharply higher.
By 3:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.7% higher, the CAC 40 in France climbed 1.6% while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 traded flat.
Russia and Ukraine have said they will continue to hold talks on a potential ceasefire, although a third round of discussions on Monday made scant progress, with Moscow continuing its bombardment of several Ukrainian cities, deepening the humanitarian crisis. 
Kyiv has rejected Moscow's offer of possible humanitarian corridors to Russia and Belarus, claiming that Russia violated three previous attempts to create them.
The conflict, and the sanctions the West has levied on Moscow as a result, have pushed oil prices up to 14-year highs, while European gas, nickel, and wheat have also climbed to record levels amid concerns about supply disruptions.
These widespread price rises have put the European Central Bank’s meeting on Thursday firmly into focus as policymakers must now grapple with the prospect of inflation, already at record highs, rising yet further just as a new crisis threatens the economy.
On the economic data front, Eurozone GDP data for the fourth quarter of last year are expected to show a surge in growth of 4.6% on the year, while data already released show German industrial production rose 2.7% on the month in January, much more than expected.
In corporate news,  Danone  (PA:DANO) stock rose 1.4% after the French food group pledged to step up investments behind its brands as it seeks to accelerate revenue growth in a fresh strategy plan.
 Greggs  (LON:GRG) stock slumped 9% after the high street bakery said it’s experiencing higher than expected cost pressures, which means it won’t make “material profit progression” in the year ahead.
 Fresnillo  (LON:FRES) stock rose 3.5% after the precious-metal miner reported a boost in profit in 2021, helped by high prices for its gold and silver production, allowing it to increase its final dividend.
Oil prices traded higher, remaining near the previous session’s 14-year highs. The latest weekly inventory report from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, is due later Tuesday, and follows a drop of just over 6 million barrels last week.
Crude had soared on Monday after the U.S. said it was discussing a ban on Russian oil with its major European allies, but gains dissipated after Germany, the biggest buyer of Russian oil, rejected plans for an energy embargo.
By 3:50 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 2.2% higher at $122.00 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 2.7% to $126.59. Both benchmarks hit their highest levels since July 2008 on Monday, with Brent hitting $139.13 a barrel and WTI $130.50.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 03:35AM ET</span>",Marketmind: Collateral damage,"A look at the day ahead in markets from Sujata Rao
All problems pale when compared with the tragedy of Ukrainians fleeing bombed-out cities. 
Others are seeing damage of a different kind -- from near worthless Russian securities on investors' books to soaring commodity prices that will show up the grocery and energy bills of consumers everywhere. 
And the ripple effects are still spreading.
After the S&P 500's worst day since October 2020, stock markets show no sign of recovery on Tuesday, with Wall Street futures down another 1% and Europe faring worse. Since mid-February, European banks have lost a quarter of their share value and an earnings hit looks inevitable 
The next move contemplated -- a ban on Russian energy imports -- could make matters worse; Capital Economics reckons that will push Brent (currently around $120) to $160 a barrel and European natural gas to 300 euros a megawatt hour from the current 215 euros or so. 
Europe as well as a raft of emerging economies would tip into recession.
Europe is resisting that ban, but it hasn't stopped Brent from jumping another $4 a barrel. Meanwhile, the green transition gets ever costlier -- from aluminium and steel used in wind turbines to nickel, a crucial component in electric vehicle batteries, prices continue to soar. 
Estimates suggest supply chain glitches pushed average new vehicle transaction prices in the United States almost fifth above year-ago levels. The hit might be bigger in the coming year, and more so in Europe -- almost half of Germany's nickel is sourced from Russia.
Fast unfolding events and daily commodity price jumps render economic data outdated. Yet they are useful to gauge what might come next; oil import costs triggered the biggest Japanese current account deficit since 2014, data showed.
U.S. February CPI, due Thursday, is expected at 7.9% year-on-year, but with last week bringing the fastest gasoline price surge in 17 years, the March print could eclipse that.
It leaves central banks facing the growth-inflation conundrum. In the euro zone where policy options are arguably most limited, two-year German ""breakevens"" a future inflation gauge, have soared above 5%. 
Commodity prices https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egvbkqbonpq/Pasted%20image%201646687011742.png

SYDNEY/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Top Glove Corp Bhd has postponed a plan to raise $347 million in a Hong Kong listing due to elevated market uncertainty after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, its managing director said on Tuesday, confirming an earlier Reuters report.
The manufacturer, which benefited from demand for disposable medical gloves during the COVID-19 pandemic, has a primary listing in Kuala Lumpur and secondary in Singapore, and had planned the Hong Kong listing to broaden its investor base.
""Due to the changing developments in the industry and the current equity market conditions, we have decided to give ourselves more time to pursue this exercise in Hong Kong,"" Lee Kim Meow told Reuters, referring to the impact of ""Russian military action"" on market sentiment.
He said the world's largest medical glove maker was in no hurry to list as the plan was for the long-term benefit.
Top Glove's Kuala Lumpur-listed shares fell 6.3% after the news. The stock has fallen 31% in 2022.
The glove maker, which reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, initially aimed to raise $1 billion in what would have been a dual primary listing.
Shareholders in December approved the issuance of up to 793.5 million shares which at the current price of 1.83 ringgit would have raised about $347 million.
Top Glove had planned to launch the deal in February but postponed it because Russia's invasion of Ukraine has weighed on investor sentiment and heightened market volatility has impacted the listing progress, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters earlier, declining to be identified as the information was not yet public.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"".
SHARE SALE HALT
A growing number of Asian share sales are being put on hold as markets remain roiled by the invasion.
MSCI's broadest index of world shares has dropped 13% year-to-date, as geopolitical uncertainty causes investors to flee equities and pile into safer assets.
Chinese fast fashion retailer Shein postponed its U.S. listing ambitions due to the upheaval, Reuters previously reported.
Life Insurance Corp's plan to raise $8 billion before March-end in India's largest-ever initial public offering (IPO) is also now in doubt.
""The prospects of ever increasing sanctions on Russia, the ongoing crackdown on real estate, tech and other sectors in China, passing of the peak of loose monetary policy in the West and it all portends to a rather quiet period for equity capital market activity until the equity and commodity markets settle down,"" Sumeet Singh, Aequitas Research director who publishes on Smartkarma, told Reuters.

Hong Kong has recorded the slowest start to the year for IPOs and secondary listings in six years with $1.17 billion raised in 2022, Refinitiv data showed.
That compares with $10.16 billion in the same period of 2021 and the lowest since 2016.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 02:35AM ET</span>",Explainer - Amazon's battle with Reliance for India retail supremacy,"By Aditya Kalra and Abhirup Roy
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - For more than a year, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and India's Future Group have been locked in a complex legal stand-off that has stalled Future's $3.4 billion sale of assets to rival Reliance Industries (NS:RELI), the country's biggest conglomerate.
After trading barbs in courtrooms for months, Amazon and Future unexpectedly agreed on March 3 to hold discussions to resolve their dispute.
Here's what the dispute, seen as key to deciding who gets an upper hand in one of the world's fastest-growing retail markets, is all about and what led to the sudden change in tone. 
WHAT TRIGGERED THE DISPUTE?
In 2019, Amazon and Future, number two player in India behind market leader Reliance, became business partners when the U.S. company invested $200 million in a unit of the Indian group. 
That deal, Amazon argues, came with non-compete clauses that prohibited Future from selling retail assets to certain rivals, including Reliance, run by one of India's richest men, Mukesh Ambani. The deal also included clauses for settlement of any disputes under rules laid down by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
But in 2020, Future - hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic - decided to sell assets to Reliance. 
Amazon then approached Singapore arbitrators and successfully stopped the sale. Both parties have also challenged each other with lawsuits in Indian courts, including the Supreme Court, since the ""seat of arbitration"" remains in New Delhi and Indian law governs the proceedings.
WHAT DO AMAZON AND FUTURE SAY?
Amazon argues various agreements signed in 2019 with Future gave it special rights over Future's retail assets, some of which it had also hoped to ultimately own should India's rules for foreign investors be eased. The potential Future-Reliance deal ""destroys"" the latter prospect, the U.S. company has said.
Future denies any wrongdoing, saying Amazon is illegally seeking to exert control on Future's retail business. Future Retail - the group's flagship retail arm - says it faces liquidation and its more than 27,000 employees can become jobless if the Reliance deal fails. 
Both sides have deployed a battery of lawyers and top Indian legal firms are involved in the high-profile matter. Two lawyers who formerly occupied the position of Solicitor General of India have played a key role in arguing for Amazon and Future.
WHAT'S THE BIGGER PICTURE?
At stake is whether Amazon can become a bigger force in a $900 billion retail market, with 1.3 billion consumers, than Reliance.
Reliance has 1,100 supermarkets, while Future has around 1,500. Both are expanding fast into e-commerce, but the Future deal will immediately boost the retail footprint of Reliance, which has attracted marquee foreign investors in the business. 
For its part, Amazon has invested $6.5 billion in India, which it counts as a key growth market where it is a leading e-commerce player. The Future partnership had already allowed Amazon to boost its online portfolio of grocery deliveries by integrating the Indian company's stores on its website.
Keeping Future away from Reliance chimes with Amazon's efforts to combat billionaire Ambani's growth plans. In one confidential legal filing, Amazon said Reliance's consolidated position with Future ""will further restrict competition in the Indian retail market"". 
HOW DID INDIA ANTITRUST AGENCY GET INVOLVED?
Future last year complained to India's antitrust agency that Amazon was making incorrect and contradictory submissions about the intent of the 2019 deal.
Amazon said it never concealed any information, but last December the watchdog suspended its approval of the 2019 deal with Future, saying there was ""a deliberate design on the part of Amazon to suppress the actual scope"" of the deal and its interest in Future's retail businesses. 
In a setback for the U.S. giant, an Indian court in January halted the Singapore arbitration proceedings between the two sides in light of the antitrust decision.
WHY AMAZON EXTENDED AN OLIVE BRANCH
In a sudden move on Feb. 25, Reliance, which had not played a public role in the dispute, started executing a de facto takeover of some 500 Future stores that represent the crown jewels of its retail network.

Reliance had assumed many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future and has now moved to take over possession citing missed rental payments.
That spooked Amazon, sources say. On March 3, Amazon cited takeover of shops and extended an olive branch during a Supreme Court hearing, saying the ""whirlpool"" of litigation must end. Future agreed to the talks, which are currently ongoing.

The U.S. lender said on Monday that along with launching in new markets and expanding its digital capabilities, the Citi Commercial Bank (CCB) unit is looking to ramp up its presence in high-growth and emerging markets. 
The bank, which currently operates in 60 countries and focuses on lending to mid-sized companies, said a bulk of the hires are expected to be in areas where it sees an increase in business activity, particularly the United States, China, Brazil, India and countries in Western Europe.
The move comes at a time when the Wall Street institution has been cutting down its international footprint by exiting non-core markets. Chief Executive Jane Fraser, who took the helm last year, has looked to simplify the bank and bring its profitability more in line with its peers.
In a separate statement on Tuesday, Citi said, as part of its global headcount expansion plan, it would hire close to 350 people, including nearly 200 commercial bankers, over the next three years to accelerate growth in the Asia Pacific region.
The hiring represents the largest investment in headcount across the bank globally, it said. 
A majority of these hires will be placed in China, Hong Kong, India and Singapore. China and India will each get around 80 new hires. Hong Kong will add close to 100 people, while another over 30 will go to Singapore.
The arrangement will strengthen Citi's services, including treasury and trade solutions, securities, and its collaboration with global wealth management. 

In 2021, the Asia Pacific business contributed 41% to the bank's global revenues of $2.7 billion.

Investing.com –  China Meheco  Co. Ltd. (SS:600056) saw its shares jump over 9% on Tuesday, and more than 50% in the past week. Speculation is growing that the Beijing-based drug maker is  Pfizer  Inc.'s (NYSE:PFE) local partner to distribute its COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid.
The company’s shares jumped 9.35% to HK$17.77 ($2.27) by 12:24 AM ET (5:24 AM GMT), after rallying by the 10% daily limit for four consecutive days. This is a big turnaround for the shares, which fell to their lowest level since 2014 in February 2022.
The state-owned company warned of uncertainties of the deal with “a certain multinational drug maker” in a statement on Monday, which did not mention Pfizer by name. Contribution to earnings would be small, and even if the deal goes smoothly, “the usage and sales of the drug may depend on factors such as virus control situation,” the statement added.
China’s National Medical Products Administration conditionally approved Paxlovid in February, the first foreign pharmaceutical product endorsed for COVID-19 in the country. The drug is approved to treat adults who have mild to moderate COVID-19 with a high risk of progressing to a severe condition.
With China Meheco the sole drug company overseen by the central government, investors are increasing their bets that the company will be the local distributor."
1559,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2022 12:05AM ET</span>",How sanctions against Russia are battering the global aviation industry,"By Jamie Freed
(Reuters) - Russia's size and close integration into the global aviation industry since the end of the Cold War means sanctions related to its invasion of Ukraine are having outsized consequences relative to earlier freezes on Iran and North Korea.
Manufacturers, lessors, insurers and maintenance providers to Russian carriers like Aeroflot, S7 Airlines and AirBridgeCargo are among those outside Russia that are hit directly by sanctions.
Foreign airlines, meanwhile, are reeling from higher oil prices and longer routes needed to bypass airspace over Russia that are expected to drive up ticket prices and air freight rates.
AIRCRAFT LEASING, INSURANCE IMPACT
Russian airlines have been highly reliant on the global aircraft leasing industry to modernise their fleets with the latest Airbus and Boeing (NYSE:BA) planes.
Russian carriers have 980 passenger jets in service, of which 777 are leased, according to analytics firm Cirium.
Of these, 515 jets with an estimated market value of about $10 billion are rented from foreign firms such as AerCap and Air Lease (NYSE:AL).
The European Union has given leasing companies until March 28 to wind up current rental contracts in Russia. 
But getting the planes back could be challenging due to airspace bans, potential SWIFT payment transfer issues and industry concerns the Russian government could nationalise the fleet to maintain domestic capacity.
Russia's state aviation authority recommended that airlines with foreign-leased planes stop flying them abroad.
Even if the planes are returned quickly, the huge number needing to be placed elsewhere could depress rental prices globally, analysts say.
Russian airlines have also been cut off from the insurance and reinsurance markets in the European Union and Britain. 
An insurance industry source said it was unclear if lessors unable to repossess planes would be covered for losses under their own policies, which typically contain clauses cancelling coverage in the event of sanctions. 
Legal action may be needed to settle the issue, said the source, who was not authorised to speak publicly. 
SALES, MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND PARTS BANS
Russian airlines have 62 planes on order with Airbus and Boeing, according to aviation consulting firm IBA, and those deliveries will be barred.
Manufacturers and maintenance firms are also banned from providing parts and services for the existing fleet.
Germany's Lufthansa Technik said it had stopped serving Russian customers, involving hundreds of planes.
Tass news agency reported the Russian transport ministry had drawn up a draft bill to help airlines until September 2022 that would allow maintenance by third-party firms and suspend all inspections of carriers.
Some aviation executives are concerned that the sanctions prevent planemakers from sharing service bulletins and airworthiness directives that are key for safety.
Viktor Berta, vice president of aviation finance advisory at ACC Aviation, said there was also a high risk that Russian airlines would need to strip parts from their existing fleet once spares run out. 
RISING OIL PRICES, LONGER FLIGHT TIMES 
Oil prices have surged to the highest level since 2008 as the United States said it was willing to ban Russian oil imports.
Oil hedging, fuel surcharges and fare increases are among the measures airlines are taking to offset some of the pain at a time when demand remains low due to the pandemic.
High oil prices are in some cases compounded by circuitous flight paths needed to avoid Russian airspace after reciprocal bans that can add up to 3.5 hours of flying.
The biggest impact is on flights between Europe and north Asian destinations like Japan, South Korea and China but other affected routes include those between southeast Asia and Europe and the United States and India.
Longer flight times also lead to higher staff costs, less cargo carrying ability and higher maintenance costs on contracts that are charged on a flight hour basis, said Brendan Sobie, an independent aviation analyst based in Singapore.

""Another concern is the impact on international passenger demand in some markets, resulting in a setback in the overall recovery of international air travel,"" he added.

The move, marked by the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, reflected the companies' ""shared ambition ... to support the entry-into-service of a hydrogen-based aircraft by 2035,"" according to the news release. 
FFI's chairman, Australian magnate Andrew ""Twiggy"" Forrest, has built most of his wealth in the highly emitting iron ore mining sector, but recently became one of business world's most outspoken advocates for fighting climate change.
""The time is now for a green revolution in the aviation industry,"" he was cited as saying. 

The partnership will allow both companies to study the application of green hydrogen - hydrogen produced from using renewable energy - in the aviation industry, seen by analysts as the sector's most promising bet to reduce emissions while keeping flight numbers high.

China conditionally approved Pfizer’s Paxlovid last month, making it the first foreign pharmaceutical product that Beijing has endorsed for Covid-19. China Meheco is the only drug company that’s overseen by the central government, leading investors to bet that it will be the local distributor instead of a private company.
Representatives from Meheco and Pfizer could not immediately be reached for comment.
The stock gained as much as 7% early Tuesday, having rallied by the 10% daily limit for four consecutive days. That’s an eye-watering rise for the stock which slumped to the lowest since 2014 just last month.
In a Monday statement to the stock exchange, the company refrained from mentioning Pfizer’s name, and instead warned of uncertainties of the deal with “a certain multinational drug maker”. It said contribution to earnings would be small, and even if the deal goes smoothly, “the usage and sales of the drug may depend on factors such as virus control situation.”

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were mostly down on Tuesday morning. A downward trend continues as a seemingly limitless rally in oil prices leads to concerns about inflation and the resultant impact on economic growth.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 was down 0.28% by 9:23 PM ET (2:23 AM GMT). Data released earlier in the day showed that the current account was JPR1.189 trillion ($10.33 billion) in January 2022, while the adjusted current account was JPY0.19 trillion.
South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.55%
In Australia, the ASX 200 was down 0.33%, with the National Australia Bank business confidence index at a better-than-expected 13 in February.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.37%
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 0.60% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.26%. China will release its consumer and producer price indexes on Wednesday.
The S&P 500 fell 3%, its worst drop since 2020, while an index of Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. dropped to its lowest level since 2016. Australian and New Zealand bonds fell, while U.S. Treasuries edged up after falling during the previous session.
Oil continued an upward trend after closing near a 14-year high on Monday. European gas, nickel, and wheat also climbed to record levels as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues to drive concerns about supply disruption. The U.S. is also looking to bar imports of Russian oil, while Russia threatened to cut natural gas supplies to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline in response.
Central banks are also looking to tighten their monetary policies, adding to the challenge. The gap between two-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury yields is the smallest since March 2020, a warning sign of smaller growth prospects.
“It’s all about slowing growth and rising inflation,” Rock Creek co-chief investment officer Alifia Doriwala told Bloomberg. “With the sanctions on Russia intensifying, it’s hitting all sectors. Then you are going to have some central bank action amidst much uncertain economic growth.”
Russian and Ukrainian officials held talks on Monday to negotiate a ceasefire, which did not make much progress. The talks will continue, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Ukraine must agree to his demands for the conflict to end.
Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) will remove Russian bonds from all its widely tracked indexes. Rating firm Fitch also suspended its commercial operations in Russia.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 80 environmental groups and other organizations on Monday urged California Governor Gavin Newsom to impose tougher rules promoting electric vehicles even as the state is moving faster than President Joe Biden's administration.
""Californians being punished by high gas prices and climate disasters deserve the fastest all-electric future Gov. Newsom can deliver,"" said Scott Hochberg of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, one of the groups signing the letter.
The groups want Newsom and California air regulators to back requiring more electric vehicles faster than the current plans and to set more stringent annual emissions reductions for gasoline-powered vehicles. They called for 7% annual increases in emissions reductions for gasoline vehicles compared with 5% on average under standards adopted under President Barack Obama.
Hochberg said Newsom ""needs to prove the state’s climate leadership with a much faster electrification timeline.”
Newsom is set to deliver his State of the State address on Tuesday. In 2020, Newsom said the state planned to phaseout the sale of new light duty internal combustion vehicles by 2035.
California accounts for about 11% of all U.S. vehicle sales, the biggest individual state market, and many states adopt its green vehicle mandates.
California aims to reach 61% zero emission electric vehicle (EV) sales by 2030, the groups noted. President Joe Biden has set a goal of 50% of new vehicle sales being electric or plug-in electric, but has not endorsed a date to phaseout gasoline-vehicle sales.
The letter https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/transportation_and_global_warming/fuel_economy_standards/pdfs/Clean-Cars-Letter-to-Gov-Newsom-March-2022.pdf, also signed by Greenpeace USA, the California Democratic Party Environmental Caucus and Friends of the Earth, want Newsom to consider requiring 80% or more zero emission vehicles by 2030.
Newsom's office did not immediately comment.
In April, the EPA said it was moving to restore legal authority to California to set tough vehicle emission rules and zero-emission vehicle mandates. In 2013, the EPA granted California a waiver to set vehicle rules. Under former President Donald Trump, it revoked the waiver in 2019.
EPA spokesman Nick Conger said Monday the agency is ""working to finalize a decision on the California waiver and expects to issue a decision in the near future.""
Some automakers have raised concerns if the EPA makes the waiver retroactive and the impact it could have on emissions requirements.

The EPA in December finalized new vehicle emissions rules restoring targets undone by Trump and require a 28.3% reduction in vehicle emissions through 2026.
Biden's push in Congress to boost EV tax credits to up to $12,500 per vehicle and reinstate them for General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains stalled along with other provisions to boost EVs.

The bank interacted with parties that submitted interest in the company and its bankers made outbound calls to others, the proxy said.

Kohl's is facing pressure from activist investors Macellum Advisors GP LLC and Engine Capital LP, which have both called on the company to sell itself.
Earlier this year, Kohl's rejected separate takeover bids from Sycamore Partners and Starboard Value-backed Acacia Research after they each offered to pay between $64 and $65 a share, valuing the company at around $9 billion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Inspector General said on Monday it will review progress by regulators in establishing the basis for certifying lower-altitude aircraft known as ""flying taxis.""
While interest in Urban Air Mobility, or highly automated aircraft that can be used for passengers and cargo and are designed to operate in populated areas, has grown substantially, it creates ""new and complex safety challenges"" for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which is currently reviewing applications for certifying eVTOL aircraft, the watchdog said.
The sector includes electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft, which use electrical propulsion to take off, hover and land vertically. The aircraft typically carry only a few passengers per pilot.
The FAA said it ""will cooperate fully with the Office of the Inspector General’s audit and looks forward to providing information about our extensive safety work in this area.""
In highlighting the challenges for the FAA, the inspector general's office noted that the existing regulation for aircraft certification that is being used is ""still primarily intended for traditional small aircraft with a pilot onboard, whereas eVTOL aircraft may be entirely autonomous.""
Well-established aviation and automotive manufacturers like Boeing (NYSE:BA), Embraer, Airbus, United Airlines,  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Stellantis are among companies pouring money into the nascent eVTOL sector.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts last year estimated the potential market for eVTOLs could be worth $1 trillion by 2040, assuming favorable regulatory outcomes. But they said regulatory risks were one of the most underestimated for the sector given strict safety requirements, especially for operating in dense urban environments, as well as noise and pollution concerns.
The FAA said last week the agency and UK civil aviation authorities have a range of discussions ""focused on facilitating certification and validating new eVTOL aircraft, production, continued airworthiness, operations, and personnel licensing.""

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes fell sharply on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite confirming it was in a bear market, as the prospect of a ban on oil imports from Russia sent crude prices soaring and fueled concerns about rising inflation.
Nasdaq ended down 20.1% from its Nov. 19 record high close, confirming the tech-heavy index has been in a bear market since hitting that record high, according to a widely used definition. That marks the Nasdaq's first bear market since 2020, when the coronavirus outbreak crushed global economies.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 10.8% from its Jan. 4 closing record high, confirming it was in a correction. A correction is confirmed when an index closes 10% or more below its record closing level.
Oil prices jumped to their highest levels since 2008 as the United States and European allies considered banning Russian oil imports, in response to the country's invasion of Ukraine, while it looked less likely that Iranian crude would return swiftly to global markets. 
Russia calls the campaign a ""special operation"".
Energy, the standout S&P 500 group so far this year, was one of the only sectors logging a gain on Monday, rising 1.6%.[O/R] 
“That concern on oil has led to concerns on higher inflation and potential for stagflation,"" said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. ""I think there is just a broader concern that there may be a hit to growth from the consumer given higher prices at the pump.”
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 797.42 points, or 2.37%, to 32,817.38, the S&P 500 lost 127.79 points, or 2.95%, to 4,201.08 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 482.48 points, or 3.62%, to 12,830.96. 
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were among the top individual drags on the S&P 500 while the financials sector fell 3.7%. The utilities sector, one of the defensive areas of the stock market, gained 1.3%.
Ukrainian officials said a bread factory had been hit by a Russian air strike as the country's negotiators assembled for talks with Russian officials after previous rounds that brought no respite in the conflict.
Shares of United Airlines Holdings (NASDAQ:UAL) Inc fell 15% and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) Holdings dropped 11.6%, among a broad downswing in travel and leisure stocks as the jump in oil prices threatened to disrupt a nascent recovery. 
Stocks have struggled to start 2022 as concerns about the Russia-Ukraine crisis have deepened a sell-off initially fueled by worries over higher bond yields as the Federal Reserve is expected to tighten monetary policy this year to fight inflation. The S&P 500 marked its lowest closing level since June 2021.
“The market was already nervous about a Fed rate hike cycle,"" said Burns McKinney, portfolio manager at NFJ Investment Group. ""Now when you layer on higher energy prices on top of that... that has the investment community increasingly concerned that we may end up quickly moving toward the late stages of the market cycle.”
Investors are waiting for a U.S. consumer prices report on Thursday, with the Fed widely expected to hike rates later this month to combat surging inflation.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.62-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.74-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 50 new 52-week highs and 69 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 63 new highs and 546 new lows.

(Reuters) -General Motors Co and South Korea's  POSCO  (NYSE:PKX) Chemical will build a $400 million facility to produce battery materials in Canada as the carmaker ramps up plans to produce mainly electric vehicles (EVs) in the future, the companies said on Monday.
The plant will produce cathode active material (CAM) for vehicle batteries in Becancour, Quebec. Cathodes are the most complex and costly chemical component of an electric vehicle battery. 
The cathode ""represents about 40% of the cost of every EV battery cell,"" said Scott Bell, GM Canada's President and Managing Director, in a news conference. ""We plan to have capacity by 2025 to build a million EVs in North America."" 
The plant's construction will begin immediately and the goal is to have it running by 2025. Once completed, it will create an estimated 200 jobs, according to a statement. GM aims to produce light vehicles that run exclusively on electricity by 2035.
The CAM produced at the plant will be used to make GM's Ultium batteries that will power the company's EVs, such as the Chevrolet Silverado EV, GMC HUMMER EV and Cadillac LYRIQ. GM's Ingersoll, Ontario, factory will launch EV production later this year, Bell said. 
Both Canada's federal government and Quebec's provincial government are working with GM and POSCO Chemical, the companies said, though details were not released.
Rich in key materials for EV battery production - including lithium, graphite, cobalt and nickel - Canada has been wooing battery makers to safeguard the future of its car manufacturing industry as the world seeks to cut emissions.
It is the second CAM plant announcement for Becancour in less than a week. On Friday, BASF SE (OTC:BASFY) said it was planning one there, too. 

Canada's Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said that Becancour will become a hub for the country's EV battery ""ecosystem"". More ""good news"" is on the way, Champagne said, adding that there were ""very live discussions"" under way about building a battery factory in Canada.
""Starting from this announcement, we will be integrated in the global supply chain for cars in North America,"" Champagne said.

By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
NEW YORK (Reuters) -Real yields in the U.S. Treasury market have gone even more negative as inflation surged, which is typically viewed as a positive factor for stocks, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has placed more emphasis on shedding risk than on the possibility of getting higher returns on Wall Street.
The decline in benchmark U.S. real yields, which have been mainly below zero since 2019, suggested that investors are piling into TIPS because of concerns about high inflation. Indeed, the war has propelled global benchmark Brent crude futures to a roughly 14-year high of just under $140 per barrel.
U.S. stocks, even with a strong earnings outlook and backed by a robust economy, may not be the best asset to hold during this geopolitical crisis, analysts said, though there was some divide in views.
""If all else equal and you sat there and saw that one of the largest countries in the world is attacking a country one-third its size and it has aspirations to reconstitute the old Russian empire, is that really a good backdrop for stocks?"" said David Petrosinelli, managing director and senior trader at broker-dealer InspereX in New York. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin, brushing aside worldwide condemnation of the invasion, which Russia calls a ""special operation"" vowed to press ahead with his offensive, which he said was going to plan, unless Kyiv surrendered.
Since Russia launched the invasion on Feb. 24, the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), also called the real yield because it strips out inflation, has fallen about 45 basis points.
The 10-year TIPS yield has collapsed by roughly 64 basis points, since the release on Feb. 10 of U.S. consumer price data showing the annual U.S. inflation for January hitting a 40-year high. On Monday, the 10-year real yield dropped to a two-month low of -1.027%. 
Real yields are an important input to broader financial conditions, and when they are low, that typically underpins U.S. equities.
""Equities like many financial assets are evaluated on the present value of their expected future cash flows,"" said Tim Wessel, macro strategist, at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in New York.
""When real yields are falling, that means the expected value of a stock's future cash flow is going to be higher. If you look at the sector breakdown of equities, if you look at the S&P 500 and compare its returns to big tech stocks or FANG stocks, they outperform the S&P on days when real yields fall,"" he added, referring to the growth-stock grouping of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), now known as Meta, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
After a sharp fall to start the year accelerated with Russia-Ukraine tensions, the benchmark S&P 500 has bounced back about 4% from its Feb 24 intraday low. But Wall Street's fear index, the VIX, has climbed and the market sold off late last week and opened down on Monday.
The S&P 500 technology index did slip slightly last week, mainly due to selling on Thursday and Friday. Since its intra-day trough on Feb. 24, that index has actually gained 4.2%.
Analysts said aside from the tumble in real yields, U.S. stocks have benefited from the view that the latest geopolitical turmoil means the Federal Reserve would take a gradual approach to tightening monetary policy, starting next week.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week he would back an initial quarter percentage-point increase in the Fed's benchmark rate at the March 15-16 meeting, but held out the prospect of hiking more aggressively this year if inflation does not ease.
""This uncertainty is going to cause the Fed to move more slowly, to tighten more slowly and as a result fall behind the curve on inflation, which is positive for risk assets and a support for them,"" said Ryan Swift, bond strategist, at BCA Research in Montreal.

InspereX's Petrosinelli thinks though that the risk in equities is in the medium to long term.
""The expectations component is really the wild card here,"" Petrosinelli said. ""We could be sitting at oil of $150 per barrel very, very easily here in the coming days and I'm not saying it's going to happen. But that can't be good for stocks.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil and other commodities prices soared while global shares tanked on Monday as the United States said it was willing to ban Russian oil imports, stoking investor fears over inflation and slowing economic growth. 
Brent, the international benchmark, briefly hit more than $139 a barrel, its highest level since 2008. Nickel prices rocketed 90%, gold broke through $2,000 an ounce and wheat jumped to a 14-year high, as industrial buyers and traders scrambled amid supply disruptions linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Euro zone real government bond yields fell sharply as surging energy prices fueled concerns that global economies are at risk of stagflation, a condition in which prices soar while growth stagnates.
Germany's 10-year and 30-year inflation-linked government bond yields fell to new record lows, while the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose slightly after touching its lowest level in two months.
Wall Street's main indexes fell sharply, with the Nasdaq Composite confirming it was in a bear market, and the pan-European STOXX 600 index cut losses of around 3% to close at a near one-year low.
President Joe Biden's administration is willing to move ahead with a U.S. ban on Russian oil imports even if European allies do not, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation,"" but it has triggered sweeping sanctions by the United States and Europe that aim to isolate Russia to a degree never before experienced by such a large economy.
""The crippling effect of oil prices above $130 would send many European economies into a recession,"" and that scenario caused European stocks to move into bear market territory, said Edward Moya, senior analyst at OANDA.
""The U.S. can handle not having any Russian energy supplies, but that is not the case for Europe.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 797.42 points, or 2.37%, the S&P 500 lost 127.79 points, or 2.95% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 482.48 points, or 3.62%.
MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 2.73%.
Brent crude futures settled up 4.3% at $123.21 a barrel. U.S. crude settled up 3.22% at $119.40 a barrel. [O/R]
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analysts estimate that the loss of Russia's 5 million barrels a day could cause crude oil prices to hit $200 a barrel. 
The Russia-Ukraine conflict also weighed on talks aimed at reviving Iran's nuclear deal with major powers, after Tehran accused Russia of ""interference.""
Nickel prices, which reached $55,000 a ton earlier in the trading session, last traded up 76% at $50,925 a ton. 
Russia supplies around 10% of the world's nickel, and investors fear that Western sanctions against Russia could disrupt air and sea shipments of commodities produced and exported by Russia.
The conflict and broader supply-chain disruptions provide a challenging backdrop for upcoming central bank meetings, ANZ economist Finn Robinson wrote in a note to investors. 
""Policy makers will need to safeguard the smooth transmission of monetary policy whilst also shoring up their inflation credentials at a time of surging inflation pressures and growing evidence of second round effects,"" Robinson wrote.
A majority of economists polled by Reuters now expect the European Central Bank will wait until the end of the year to raise interest rates. 
In the United States, investors are closely watching the consumer prices report due out on Thursday. The data is expected to show core U.S. CPI for February rose 6.4% year-on-year, up from 6% in January.
A hotter reading will likely seal a Federal Reserve rate hike later this month.
Traders now see a 99% probability of a 25 basis-point rate hike by the Fed at its March meeting, while seeing a 1% chance of no change in rates. 

The dollar index, which measures the value of the greenback against six global peers, was last up 0.33% at 99.24.

JPMorgan had placed Russia on index watch on March 1 after sanctions were imposed on the country.
The Wall Street bank runs the widely followed family of sovereign hard-currency indexes EMBI, as well as a corporate debt counterpart CEMBI. It also has the GBI-EM benchmark for local debt in emerging currencies and the JESG index governed by environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.
Russia will be excluded from the EMBI indexes, including the investment grade and other credit bucket sub-indexes, the bank said on Monday.
Local-currency denominated Russian bonds will be excluded from the GBI-EM indices and accrued interest for such bonds will be set to zero and suspended as of March 7, it said.
Russia and Belarus will be excluded from the JESG EMBI, JESG GBI-EM, and JESG CEMBI indices, it added.
Global assets worth $842 billion are benchmarked against JPMorgan's indexes, according to the bank. Russia has a weighting of 0.89% in the EMBIG Diversified index, and a 1.03% weighting in the ESG version of the index.

Russia's weighting in key emerging market indexes took a sharp hit after sanctions were imposed in the wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The weightings subsequently recovered some ground, only to take another dive this year as tensions over Ukraine sharply escalated in recent weeks.
Index providers FTSE Russell and MSCI said last week they were taking similar steps as deepening sanctions and public pressure isolate Russia's economy from Western investment and trading partners.

(Reuters) -Boeing Co said on Monday it had suspended buying titanium from Russia, while its European rival Airbus continues to use supplies from the nation that hosts the world's largest supplier of the commodity, VSMPO-AVISMA. The U.S. planemaker said it had ""substantial"" inventory of the metal, prized in aerospace for its strength relative to its weight and its compatibility with the latest generation of carbon-fibre, long-distance passenger jets. ""We have suspended purchasing titanium from Russia. Our inventory and diversity of titanium sources provide sufficient supply for airplane production,"" Boeing (NYSE:BA) said in an emailed statement. The suspension was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal. The head of state-controlled VSMPO-AVISMA hit out at Boeing's decision to suspend the contract, which had been renewed four months ago at the Dubai Airshow where Boeing pledged to keep the Russian company as its largest titanium supplier.
The two companies had also agreed to increase the use of a forgings manufacturing joint-venture - Ural Boeing Manufacturing - in Russia's Titanium Valley in the Urals. ""We sincerely regret that the contracts with our long-term partner are suspended,"" VSMPO-AVISMA Chief Executive Dmitry Osipov said in an emailed statement on Monday. ""We are now reorienting our sales policy to other markets,"" he said, adding that the company had prepared for such an outcome for several months.
Western governments imposed sanctions on Russia after it invaded Ukraine in what it calls a “special military operation,” but they have not targeted VSMPO-AVISMA, 25% of which is owned by state defense conglomerate Rostec. It relies on aerospace for three quarters of its sales. The potential for disruption to Russian commodity supplies has thrown a spotlight on titanium, which is also used in the marine, auto and nuclear industries.
AIRBUS SUPPLIES In France, Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) said it continued to source titanium from Russia and other countries. In an emailed statement, it said it was also obtaining titanium indirectly via its first-tier suppliers, all in compliance with sanctions.
The European planemaker has said it relies on Russia for half of its overall titanium needs, while VSMPO-AVISMA provides a third of Boeing's requirements.
Industry sources say Airbus receives its Russian titanium primarily from VSMPO-AVISMA with some titanium parts for landing gear supplied by Nizhny Novgorod-based Hydromash.
It has said that its general ability to boost jet output depends on the availability of raw materials, including titanium. Its NH90 and Tiger military helicopter programmes have relied on Russian titanium, according to Airbus' 2019 annual report.

Airbus did not immediately respond to a query about the specific status of its VSMPO-AVISMA contract.
Aerospace companies worldwide have been increasing stocks of titanium and moving to diversify sources since the Crimea crisis in 2014.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 05:27PM ET</span>",Mutual fund manager Vanguard suspends purchases of Russian securities,"By Ross Kerber and Davide Barbuscia
BOSTON (Reuters) -Vanguard Group has suspended purchases of Russian securities from its actively managed funds, the top mutual fund manager said on Monday.
Pennsylvania-based Vanguard said the suspension applies ""across our internally and externally managed active funds."" It said the company is also working to exit positions across its index funds.
The statement https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/vanguards-response-to-war-in-ukraine.html on the Vanguard website took a more aggressive line than the company did on Friday when it said it would not restrict managers' investment decisions and on Monday morning in a statement sent by a Vanguard spokesperson that it was in talks with external managers. 
A Vanguard representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the change.
Some rival fund companies had already taken similar steps as deepening sanctions and public pressure isolate Russia's economy from Western investment and trading partners. 
On Thursday, BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) said it had suspended the purchase of all Russian securities in its active and index funds. 
Franklin Templeton said https://investors.franklinresources.com/news-center/media-statements/Media-Statement-Details/2022/Franklin-Templeton-Statement-on-Russia-and-Belarus/default.aspx on Friday it would make no new investments in Russia or Belarus in sovereign or corporate debt, or public or private equity, and may take further steps.
Russia has called its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation."" 
Passive index funds account for most of Vanguard's roughly $8.1 trillion under management, but $1.7 trillion of that is in actively managed funds, with $767 billion run by external managers such as Wellington Management of Boston and Baillie Gifford of Scotland.
Total exposure to Russia accounts for less than 0.01% of client assets, Vanguard said. Its statement said it moved quickly to carry out sanctions against Russian banks and others, ""and to make needed adjustments prompted by market closures and index provider changes.""

Major index providers, including MSCI and FTSE Russell, also have been removing Russian equities and debt. 
Morningstar Inc on Monday said it would take steps to remove Russian equities from certain Morningstar indexes, and make similar change removing certain Russian debt from fixed-income indexes.

(Reuters) -Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing will keep its stores in Russia open, joining a small group of international firms that are staying put even as dozens of big brands temporarily shutter operations or exit the country over its invasion of Ukraine.
Political pressure is building on companies to halt business in Russia, while operations have also been complicated by sweeping sanctions affecting everything from global payments systems to a range of high-tech products. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co on Monday said it had suspended buying titanium from Russia, since it had sufficient supply for plane production, while European rival Airbus said it was sourcing titanium from Russia and other countries in accordance with sanctions.
Large shippers have suspended container routes to and from Russia and many Western companies, from  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE) and home furnishings giant Ikea to energy majors BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa), have closed shop or announced plans to exit the country.
Dutch technology investor Prosus (OTC:PROSF) will write off a $700-million stake in Moscow-headquartered online platform VK Group, known for the VKontakte social network, Russia's answer to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). VK Group's CEO Vladimir Kirienko was added to a U.S. sanctions list after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
A spokesperson told Reuters the company had seen no noticeable impact on its supply chain or logistics in Russia, where Uniqlo has 49 stores. 
""Clothing is a necessity of life. The people of Russia have the same right to live as we do,"" said CEO Tadashi Yanai of Japan-based Fast Retailing, in remarks first reported by Nikkei, adding that every country should oppose war.
In contrast,  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI) suspended its Russian operations, including any new investments.
Some American companies are continuing to operate in Russia, including McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) and PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc, prompting New York state's pension fund - a shareholder in the pair - to urge them and others to consider pausing their operations there.
The conflict may create opportunities, potentially including Europe scrapping a ban on several Brazilian meatpackers imposed in 2018 after a food sector scandal, sources said.
""The (Brazilian) industry is prepared to cover gaps and support the food security of nations that may be short-supplied by the likely suspension or decrease in exports of chicken and pork from Russia and Ukraine,"" said Ricardo Santin, president of meat lobby ABPA.
ABPA, which represents companies including JBS and BRF in Brazil, the largest global exporter of chicken meat, said Russia and Ukraine compete with Brazilians in important markets in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
Major global companies are continuing to join the exit from Russia. The Big Four accounting firms KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte moved one by one to cut their ties with Russia, as did credit card company  American Express  (NYSE:AXP). 
Mutual fund manager Vanguard Group has suspended purchases of Russian securities from its actively managed funds, the top mutual fund manager said on Monday.
Dairy cooperative Arla Foods, French yoghurt maker Danone and Belgian chemicals group  Solvay  (BR:SOLB) also suspended operations or investment in the country, while the RIA Novosti news agency cited carmaker Nissan (OTC:NSANY) as saying it would halt production at its factory in St Petersburg.
Russia announced new ""humanitarian corridors"" on Monday to transport Ukrainians trapped under its bombardment - to Russia itself and its ally Belarus, a move immediately denounced by Kyiv as an immoral stunt.
Russia calls the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a ""special military operation."" It denies attacking civilian areas and says it has no plans to occupy Ukraine.
After Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a new media law on Friday, Chinese-owned video app TikTok said it would suspend live-streaming and the uploading of videos to its platform in Russia.
'UNJUSTIFIED ATTACK'
Many companies have strongly condemned Russia's actions as they suspended services in the country.

""In light of Russia's ongoing, unjustified attack on the people of Ukraine, American Express is suspending all operations in Russia,"" AMEX said on its website.
Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which had already temporarily stopped future projects and acquisitions in Russia, suspended its service ""given the situation on the ground"", a spokesperson said.

1577,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 04:41PM ET</span>","Apple's Peek, AMC's Sales, Oil's Climb: 3 Things to Watch","By Sam Boughedda
Investing.com – Stocks tumbled on Monday after a weekend of escalating attacks by Russia in Ukraine and talk that the U.S. and western allies might ban imports of Russian oil.
Talk of a ban helped push oil prices to $130 overnight on Monday, though they did ease back in the U.S. session. Still, the concern about supply shocks resulting from the conflict in Ukraine is sending commodity prices soaring to multi-year records.
Gasoline prices in the U.S. are near levels not seen since 2008.
The Federal Reserve meets next week to decide the course of interest rate increases, though many are concerned the Fed might misstep in its bid to tame inflation amid this crisis in Eastern Europe.
Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week backed a quarter-point rate increase at the March 15-16 policy meeting. He told Congress he would  move more aggressively later if inflation didn’t abate.
The Biden administration is considering banning Russian oil imports as a way of turning up the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin, who himself is the subject of sanctions over Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. 
Tens of thousands of refugees continued to stream across Ukraine’s western borders with Poland and other neighboring countries, creating a humanitarian crisis that western allies were rushing to aid. Congress is expected to consider a $10 billion relief package for Ukraine this week.
Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
1. Apple peek
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has its first product event of the year, which is named ""Peek Performance."" At the event, Apple is expected to announce various product updates, including Macbook and iMac upgrades, while an updated iPhone SE with 5G is highly anticipated. 
The iPhone SE is Apple's entry-level iPhone. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives — who has an outperform rating and $200 price target on Apple — told investors in a note Monday that he expects the company to launch its third iPhone SE alongside a revamped iPad Air and a new Mac version. 
2. AMC ticket sales
AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) recorded its third-highest attended weekend since movie theaters reopened in the summer of 2020. More than 4 million tickets were sold globally at AMC locations Thursday through Sunday, with AMC citing the success of the Warner Bros. release of the latest Batman movie. The attendance outpaced the year-over-year attendance for the same weekend in 2019 and 2020.
3. Oil climbs
Crude Oil WTI Futures prices hit 2008 highs on Monday as the United States and Europe kept open their proposed ban on Russian oil. Analysts warned of record highs of $150 a barrel next, although a survey suggested that Americans may already be driving less, with pump prices of fuel hitting all-time highs.
The U.S. national average for gasoline surged to $4.104 per gallon on Monday, just ahead of the previous all-time of $4.103 per gallon in 2008, before the onset of the Great Recession.

COMMUNICATIONS
Ukraine said on Monday it had received Starlink satellite internet terminals donated by SpaceX, but CEO Elon Musk and an internet security researcher warned these could become Russian targets.

Jysk will provide refugees in need with blankets or other items from the Danish home retailer's stock, a spokesman told Reuters on Thursday as the group reopened eight stores in western Ukraine. 
ACCOMMODATION
Airbnb said it was working with its hosts to offer free, short-term housing to up to 100,000 refugees from Ukraine, and that it was temporarily waiving its booking fees there.
Nordic Choice has offered free lodging in its Vilnius hotel, while Poland's Arche Hotels said three days after Russia launched the invasion that it had already put up 1,000 refugees as it prepared to lodge 5,000, and called for clothes, Polish language books and toy donations for children fleeing Ukraine. 
HEALTHCARE
Sweden's Medicover and private Polish provider LuxMed said they were providing free medical assistance at the border, while Gdansk-based Nivique clinic offered free gynaecological services to female refugees.
Merck & Co said it has delivered 135,000 courses of its COVID-19 antiviral pill through an agreement with the government and donated 100,000 courses of the drug to an aid organization providing medical support in the region. 
French cosmetics group L'Oreal said it aimed to deliver 300,000 hygiene products to Ukraine in coming weeks, while U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) pledged over $9 million-worth in insulin and COVID-19 medicine supplies for aid organisations there and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) $4 million in medical equipment such as mobile x-ray units and ventilators.
TRAVEL
Train operators across Central and Western Europe have offered free travel to Ukrainians, including Polish PKP Intercity trains and Germany's Deutsche Bahn, while Flixbus said it would send more free buses to run routes from the main Polish border crossing of Medyka.
Car rental companies Panek CarSharing and 4Mobility said they would allocate parts of their fleet for transport to the border and invited volunteers to help, while Uber (NYSE:UBER) announced unlimited free rides from the border to Polish cities.
LOGISTICS
Low-cost airline Ryanair, which has suspended all its flights to and from Ukraine, has begun carrying medical supplies from the UK and Ireland to Polish airports, its CEO said on Wednesday.
Trans.EU said it was organising a network of carriers to bring supplies to Ukraine from Western Europe and the CEO of Krakow-based InPost said he would mobilise parts of the parcel group's fleet to bring aid to the border.

Several banks have promised to waive or refund fees for transfers to Ukraine, including Dutch lender ING, Poland's mBank and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY)'s Polish branch, which offered free withdrawals to Ukrainian customers. Nordea Bank ABP also waived transaction fees on donations to charities offering emergency aid.
DONATIONS OVER $5 MLN

Multinational firms and their foundations have pledged cash for aid organisations, including around $16 million from Danish toymaker Lego, $10 million each from crypto giant Binance and Danish brewer Carlsberg (OTC:CABGY), and $5 million each from Biedronka-owner Jeronimo Martins, French luxury group LVMH, U.S. internet giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).

1579,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 04:36PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Wall Street regulator to propose climate risk rule as early as next Wednesday -sources,"By Katanga Johnson and Jarrett Renshaw
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to propose its landmark climate risk rule as early as next Wednesday, March 16, said two people familiar with the agency's planning.
One of the people, who spoke anonymously about private agency plans, said the Wall Street regulator is ""committed"" to issuing the proposal by month end.
An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.
Last year, the SEC began working on its new measure that would require U.S.-listed companies to provide investors with detailed disclosures on how climate change could affect their business.
The move to issue the rule, which would be subject to public consultation, comes after a number of delays. The SEC initially said it would publish a draft in October, but Chair Gary Gensler subsequently pushed that deadline to January.
At issue: the agency was trying to decide whether it should require companies to disclose not only their own greenhouse gas emissions, but those generated by their suppliers and other partners. Media reports last month highlighted that the commissioners were divided on how far to go, Reuters previously reported.
Last month, however, lawmakers, including Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, criticized the agency and called for ""quick action"" on the issue. 
Corporate groups have said they will continue to push for a narrower final rule that will make it easier and less expensive to gather and report emissions data, and which will protect them from being sued over potential mistakes.
Advocates, however, will likely herald the agency's measure. 

""It's great to see the SEC beginning this important effort,"" said Todd Phillips, director of financial regulation and corporate governance at the Washington-based Center for American Progress.
""Investors and asset managers can only make sound investing decisions when they have standardized and comparable information about companies' greenhouse gas emissions.""

The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an alert on Monday advising all financial institutions to be vigilant and laying out examples of red flags that it said would help identify sanctions evasion activity, including the use of shell companies.
""In the face of mounting economic pressure on Russia, it is vitally important for U.S. financial institutions to be vigilant about potential Russian sanctions evasion, including by both state actors and oligarchs,"" FinCEN Acting Director Him Das said in a statement. 
The United States has imposed several rounds of sanctions - targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin, oligarchs, the central bank, and major lenders - after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two. Moscow calls the assault a ""special operation.""
FinCEN said in the alert on Monday that as a result of the measures, targeted Russian and Belarusian actors may seek to evade sanctions. The activities could be conducted through a variety of actors, the alert said, including convertible virtual currency exchangers and administrators.
The alert also warned of possible ransomware attacks.

FinCEN called on financial institutions to report suspicious activity related to possible sanctions evasion quickly and conduct risk-based customer due diligence.
""Although we have not seen widespread evasion of our sanctions using methods such as cryptocurrency, prompt reporting of suspicious activity contributes to our national security and our efforts to support Ukraine and its people,"" Das said.

Investing.com -- Clarus Corp (NASDAQ:CLAR) jumped 14% after-hours Monday after the company reported its fourth-quarter results beating analysts' earnings and revenue expectations.
The developer, manufacturer, and distributor of outdoor equipment and lifestyle products reported earnings per share of 45 cents compared to 34 cents during the same quarter the previous year. Revenue came in at a record $118.2 million, beating expectations of $106 million.
The company's sales for the full year 2021 increased 68% to a record $375.8 Million.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Monday, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continued to push oil prices to 14-year highs, stoking fears that red-hot inflation will be here to stay longer than expected and derail economic growth.
The S&P 500 fell 3.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.4%, or 797 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6%.
The third round of Ukraine-Russia talks ended with both sides indicating little progress had been made in search of a resolution to the conflict. The failure to reach a breakthrough heightened concerns about the economic impact of soaring commodity prices including wheat, corn, nickel and oil.
Oil prices topped their highest level since 2008 after the U.S. said it was mulling imposing a ban on Russia oil and gas.
There is a hope the U.S. and Iran will reach a new nuclear deal, bringing much-needed Iranian oil barrels onto the market, but the potential supply from the Islamic Republic isn’t enough to offset the risk of loss of Russian oil.
“Iran could export up to 2.5 million barrels of crude oil per day, yet Russian crude oil exports total 4.6 million barrels per day,” Commerabank said in a note.
The surging in oil prices hurt airline stocks as higher fuel costs are expected to weigh on the growth. Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) suffered heavy losses.  
Consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest sector decliner, led by U.S. luxury fashion and apparel stocks on concerns that weaker investor sentiment in Europe will weigh on growth.
Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), PVH (NYSE:PVH), were sharply lower, with the latter down more than 15%.
Wedbush downgraded Ralph Lauren and PVH to neutral from outperform as both companies are “very reliant” on European growth, which will likely take a hit from the Ukraine-Russia conflict.  
The selling in bank stocks showed no sign of end. Regional banks including Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), and SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) and  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY) continued to take a hammering, while megacap banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (NYSE:BA) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) were also deeply in the red.
In other news, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) surged more than 37% after GameStop’s Chairman Ryan Cohen said the retailer should consider a sale and a spin-off its buybuy Baby chain. Cohen has a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond.
Mandiant (NASDAQ:MNDT) surged more than 16% on reports that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is reportedly in talks to acquire cyber security firm.
The broader market, which has slipped deeper in correction – a more than 10% loss from its recent peak – appears to be trying to find a bottom.
""Small-caps are starting to bottom …  a positive sign that U.S. equity markets in general are now searching for some type of bottom in earnest,” Janney Montgomery Scott, but added that “this does not necessarily preclude more volatility ahead.”"

Still, AMC shares fell more than 8% for the day.
More than 4 million tickets were sold globally at AMC locations Thursday through Sunday, with AMC stating it was due to ""the strength of the successful opening weekend of THE BATMAN from Warner Bros. and DC.""

1584,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 03:56PM ET</span>",Europe energy crisis a 'big wake up call' -TotalEnergies CEO,"By Ron Bousso
HOUSTON (Reuters) -Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a ""big wake up call"" for European governments hoping to balance the need for fossil fuels with environmental concerns, the head of French energy giant TotalEnergies said on Monday.
Europe depends on Russian natural gas, which supplies around 40% of its needs. On Monday, benchmark gas prices shot to their highest on record, as traders worried Russia could curtail supplies.
""What is happening today in Europe is a big wake up call to a lot of policy makers if they are serious about security of supply, affordability and of course climate change compatibility,"" TotalEnergies Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. 
""We must think about the three parts of this triangle and not think that only one part is important.""
Europe aims to sharply reduce its reliance on fossil fuels in the coming decades to battle climate change, with governments restricting oil and gas production and financing of fossil fuel projects. 
While Europe's solar and wind power generation capacity has grown sharply in recent years, its power and energy systems remain heavily reliant on natural gas and coal.
Pouyanne said Europe needs to build more infrastructure to import additional LNG if it wants an alternative to Russian gas.
""The reality in Europe is that we don't have enough re-gas terminals today to replace the volume of piped gas from Russia by LNG.""
NO PRESSURE
Pouyanne said TotalEnergies did not come under government pressure to fully exit Russia following the Ukraine invasion.
TotalEnergies is the only major Western energy company that does not plan to fully exit Russia; BP (NYSE:BP), Shell (LON:RDSa) and Exxon (NYSE:XOM) all announced their intentions to withdraw. TotalEnergies has said it will halt all new spending in Russia.
The French oil major holds a 19.4% stake in Novatek, Russia's largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), as well as a stake in the Novatek-led Arctic LNG project.
""I had discussions obviously with the highest authority in my country and there is no push from them for us to exit Russia,"" Pouyanne told a gathering of energy executives. 

Pouyanne said that Western sanctions on Russia exclude natural gas and that it would therefore be inconsistent for companies that produce the gas to exit the country. 
TotalEnergies nevertheless has stopped buying oil from Russia, Pouyanne added, although one its landlocked refineries in Germany continues to receive Russian crude by pipeline.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 03:56PM ET</span>","Telecom Italia CEO briefs investors, shares slide again","By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) -Shares in  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) hit record lows on Monday as the head of Italy's biggest phone group met investors to try to persuade them of the merits of his plans to revive the former phone monopoly.
The TIM roadshow comes ahead of a decision expected shortly on a 10.8 billion euro ($11.7 billion) takeover proposal made by U.S. fund KKR in November.
A board meeting to draw up a response to the KKR proposal could be held next weekend once TIM's advisers complete their analysis to compare TIM's planned in-house revamp with KKR's plan, said two sources close to the matter.
Ahead of their assessment this week, TIM's advisers have asked the U.S. fund to clarify whether the terms of its November offer still stand, the sources added.
TIM shares, which lost about 30% of their value in the final two sessions of last week, had another torrid day on Monday. The shares ended down 5.5% at 0.236 euros after touching a record low of 0.22 euros.
Volumes today were more than six time the 30-day average, with nearly 5% of voting capital changing hands.
The shares remain way below the 0.505 euro level at which the KKR approach was pitched. 
Backed by TIM's leading investor Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), which billed KKR's proposal as too low, CEO Pietro Labriola's plan is centred around the structural separation of TIM's fixed-network business from its retail operations.
Last week Labriola said that KKR's plan for TIM was similar but that he was convinced doing it internally could generate more value for investors, including minority shareholders. 
However, a third source said that some members of TIM's board of directors have reservations about ditching KKR's proposal without further talks with the fund.
Labriola was holding face-to-face meetings with investors in Milan and will also give a series of teleconference briefings between now and Wednesday, the sources said.
VIDEO MESSAGE
The sources said that Labriola had met representatives from BlackRock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest asset manager and a main shareholder in TIM. Foreign institutional investors own 41.3% of the group.
Labriola, a veteran TIM executive who in January became TIM's fifth CEO in six years, sought to reassure employees about the future of the company in a video message to the group's 42,500 domestic staff over the weekend. 
Labriola urged them not to panic and to focus on serving customers and take pride in TIM's role as Italy's main telecoms operator.
""Many of you are worried; I am too, but make sure you distinguish between a healthy concern and panic,"" he said in the video.
The message went down badly with unions, which labelled his plan destructive and vowed to oppose it.

Hit by stiff competition in its core domestic market as well as regulatory constraints, debt-laden TIM reported a record 8.7 billion euro loss for 2021 and said it expected a low-teens decrease in its 2022 core profit, based on the current group structure..

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 03:52PM ET</span>",Intel's Mobileye confidentially files for U.S. IPO,"By Niket Nishant and Anirban Sen
(Reuters) -Intel Corp's self-driving car unit Mobileye (F:0ME) confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the United States on Monday, setting the stage for what is expected to be one of the biggest stock market flotations of the year. 
The move to list Mobileye is part of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)'s broader strategy under Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger to turn around its core business.
Investors have made big bets on new technologies in the business of global transportation over the past few years, and Intel is aiming to take advantage of the demand for autonomous vehicles by listing Mobileye's shares. 
Technology powering driverless cars has been gaining traction even among legacy automakers such as Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co, General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, which have been investing on models with features such as driver-assist and self-driving systems.
Intel, however, is looking to test capital markets at a time when investor interest in IPOs has waned significantly due to recent stock market volatility amid fears of looming rate hikes and geopolitical tensions. 
Traditional U.S. IPOs have raised about $2.33 billion since the beginning of the year, compared to $26.67 billion during the same period last year, according to Dealogic. In recent weeks, several companies have postponed or scrapped their plans to go public. 
BLOCKBUSTER DEAL
Intel did not disclose more details about the IPO, but it had previously said it would receive the majority of the proceeds from the share sale. Some of those funds will be used to build more Intel chip plants, Gelsinger said in December.
The chip giant will also retain a majority stake in the unit after the IPO, it had said previously. In December, Reuters and other media outlets reported that the IPO could value Mobileye at more than $50 billion, although Mobileye may now struggle to get the same valuation given the recent market volatility, people familiar with the matter said. 
Mobileye, an Israeli company that Intel bought for about $15.3 billion in 2017, uses a camera-based system with adaptive cruise control and lane change assistance in driverless cars.
The company, founded in 1999, plans to eventually build its own ""lidar"" sensor to help its cars map out a three-dimensional view of the road. It is currently using lidar units from Luminar Technologies on its initial robotaxis in the meantime.

Mobileye, which counts BMW, Audi, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), Nissan (OTC:NSANY), Honda and General Motors as its clients, has been a bright spot for Intel, which faces stiff competition in the chip-making segment from rivals Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. 
Gelsinger has been under pressure from activist investors to consider spinning off Intel's chip operations, but the company still plans to invest billions to expand its chip-manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and grow its market share.

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 fell Monday, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict continued to push commodity prices higher, stoking fears that red-hot inflation will be here to stay longer than expected and derail economic growth.
The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.2%, or 724 points, the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.2%.
The third round of Ukraine-Russia talks ended with both sides indicating little progress had been made to find resolution to the conflict. The failure to reach a breakthrough heightened concerns about the economic impact of soaring commodity prices including oil.
Oil prices topped their highest level since 2008 after the U.S. said it was mulling imposing a ban on Russia oil and gas.
There is a hope the U.S. and Iran will reach a new nuclear deal that would bring Iranian oil barrels onto the market, but the potential supply from the Islamic Republic isn’t enough to offset the potential loss of Russian oil.
“Iran could export up to 2.5 million barrels of crude oil per day, yet Russian crude oil exports total 4.6 million barrels per day,” Commerabank said in a note.
The surging in oil prices hurt airline stocks as higher fuel costs are expected to weigh on the growth. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) were down more than 12%, while American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) was down more than 11%.
Consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest sector decliner, led by U.S. luxury fashion and apparel stocks on concerns that weaker investor sentiment in Europe will weigh on growth.
Tapestry (NYSE:TPR), Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), PVH (NYSE:PVH), were sharply lower, with the latter down more than 15%.
Wedbush downgraded Ralph Lauren and PVH to neutral from outperform as both companies are “very reliant” on European growth, which will likely take a hit from the Ukraine-Russia conflict.  
The selling in bank stocks showed no sign of end. Regional banks including Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), and SVB Financial (NASDAQ:SIVB) and  Signature Bank  (NASDAQ:SBNY) continued to take a hammering, while megacap banks such as Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  & Company (NYSE:WFC) were also deeply in the red.
In other news, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) surged more than 37% after GameStop’s Chairman Ryan Cohen said the retailer should consider a sale and a spin-off its buybuy Baby chain. Cohen has a nearly 10% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond.
The broader market, which has slipped deeper in correction – a more than 10% loss from its recent peak – appears to be trying to find a bottom.
""Small-caps are starting to bottom …  a positive sign that U.S. equity markets in general are now searching for some type of bottom in earnest,” Janney Montgomery Scott, but added that “this does not necessarily preclude more volatility ahead.”"

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Soaring grain prices in the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine are hurting Brazilian meatpackers, but trade disruptions facing Ukrainian and Russian meat producers may be an opportunity to boost Brazil's share in global trade, industry sources said. 
Russia and Ukraine together account for about 29% of global wheat exports and 19% of corn exports, both of which can be used as livestock feed.
Depending on how the situation plays out, the conflict may also lead to Brazil accessing markets served by competitors. According to the sources, one potential development is Europe scrapping a ban on several Brazilian meatpackers imposed in 2018 after a food sector scandal. 
""The industry is prepared to cover gaps and support the food security of nations that may be short-supplied by the likely suspension or decrease in exports of chicken and pork from Russia and Ukraine,"" said Ricardo Santin, president of meat lobby ABPA.
ABPA, which represents companies including JBS and BRF in Brazil, the largest global exporter of chicken meat, said Russia and Ukraine compete with Brazilians in important markets of Asia, the Middle East and Europe.
If Ukrainian exporters stop shipping meats amid difficulties caused by the war, Santin said Europe will face a ""great challenge."" 
According ABPA, there are about 20 Brazilian plants currently suspended by the Europeans. 

Ukraine's poultry exports totals about 430,000 tonnes per year, representing some 10% of what Brazil traded in 2021, said Alcides Torres, director at Scot Consultoria.
""If Europe really needs Brazilian meat, it is clear that these suspended slaughterhouses .... will be reviewed quickly,"" Torres said.

The investment group said its new board, led by Chairman Mervyn Davies, would work to protect the 120,000 jobs associated with the group's holdings after the European Union slapped sanctions on Fridman and co-founder Petr Aven last week.
LetterOne, which counts telecoms groups Veon and Turkcell in its portfolio, said the three departing directors - German Khan, Alexey Kuzmichev and Andrei Kosogov - had not been sanctioned but they believed stepping down was the right thing to do.
Fridman and Aven's shareholdings are frozen indefinitely and they cannot receive dividends or any other financial benefit from LetterOne, the company said.
The two long-term partners, who earned billions of dollars from oil, banking and retail, vowed last week to contest the EU sanctions imposed in retaliation for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Both said EU allegations against them were false and defamatory.
LetterOne said on Monday it would make a donation of $150 million to those affected by war in Ukraine.
""LetterOne's shareholders have also agreed that all dividends from LetterOne will be paid to ongoing relief efforts for the foreseeable future,"" the group said in a statement.
Chairman Mervyn Davies said: ""The new board and I will focus on protecting the enormous economic and social contribution LetterOne makes.
""I am also determined to ensure that the 120,000 jobs throughout the UK, US and Europe are protected.""

In a memo to Disney staff, Chapek wrote that he met Friday with a group of Disney's LGBTQ+ leaders to discuss the legislation and its potential impact on their communities. He expressed the leadership team's support for Disney's employees and their families and the company's commitment to inclusion -- though Disney would not issue a statement.
""As we have seen time and again, corporate statements do very little to change outcomes or minds,"" Chapek wrote. ""Instead, they are often weaponized by one side or the other to further divide and inflame. Simply put, they can be counterproductive and undermine more effective ways to achieve change."" 
Disney's Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, is the company's largest theme park. Its sprawling businesses also include movie studios, broadcast and cable television networks, streaming services, cruise lines and retail products. 
Florida’s House of Representatives approved a Republican-backed bill last month that Democrats denounced as being anti-LGBTQ. The legislation, referred to by opponents as the “don’t say gay” bill, has stirred national controversy as the debate over what schools should teach children about race and gender has grown increasingly partisan.

Critics, including Abigail Disney, the granddaughter of company co-founder Roy O. Disney, tweeted Sunday that she is ""deeply angered by Disney thinking it can look the other way for this hateful 'Don't Say Gay' bill."" She also took issue with Disney's political contributions to the legislators who drafted the bill. 
Chapek wrote that Disney has not made political contributions ""based on this issue,"" and has supported Republican and Democratic legislators who have taken positions on both sides of the measure.

(Reuters) -Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc revealed a more than $5 billion stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY), as oil prices soared to their highest level in about a decade.
Berkshire said it owns 91.2 million Occidental shares, or nearly 10% of those outstanding, including 61.4 million bought from March 2 to March 4.
Buffett's company disclosed the stake in a Friday night filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Occidental's share price, which jumped 45% last week, rose as much as 4.7% on Monday before retreating.
The shares were down 4.8% at $53.45 in early afternoon trading. Occidental traded below $9 as recently as October 2020.
Oil prices have surged higher following Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month, prompting fears of supply shortages.
Berkshire also has warrants to buy another 83.9 million Occidental shares at $59.62 each, or $5 billion.
It obtained these in 2019, when it also purchased $10 billion of preferred stock - which throws off $800 million of annual dividends - to help finance Occidental's $35.7 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC).
News of Berkshire's latest investment came as billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, a critic of the Anadarko merger, last week exited his own Occidental stake.
Berkshire did not immediately respond on Monday to a request for comment.
Buffett had lamented in his Feb. 26 annual shareholder letter that ""we find little that excites us"" in equity markets.
The billionaire's Omaha, Nebraska-based company, whose businesses include Geico car insurance and the BNSF railroad, ended December with $146.7 billion of cash and equivalents.
It also invested $350.7 billion in equities such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC),  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) Co.
Berkshire did not say whether Buffett or his portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler made the latest Occidental investment, though larger investments are normally Buffett's.
Combs and Weschler recently invested a combined $34 billion.
Buffett has gone six years without a major acquisition, and Berkshire has slowed share repurchases following a record $27 billion in 2021.

James Shanahan, an Edward Jones & Co analyst who rates Berkshire ""buy,"" in a research report said ""we are becoming more optimistic about cash deployment"" at Berkshire.
He said Berkshire could buy the 8.9% of Berkshire Hathaway Energy it does not already own.

(Reuters) -Billionaire investor Ryan Cohen said on Sunday he now owns nearly 10% of Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) and wants the housewares retailer to explore strategic alternatives that include a full sale of the company.
Cohen, who co-founded online pet products retailer Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) and is chairman of the board of videogame retailer  GameStop Corp  (NYSE:GME), criticized Bed Bath & Beyond, which is worth roughly $1.6 billion, for an ""overly ambitious"" strategy, overpaying its top executives and failing to reverse market share losses.
""We believe Bed Bath needs to narrow its focus to fortify operations and maintain the right inventory mix to meet demand, while simultaneously exploring strategic alternatives that include separating buybuy Baby, Inc and a full sale of the Company,"" Cohen wrote in a letter to the company's board.
Cohen said in the letter he owns 9.8% of the company through his investment company RC Ventures LLC. 
Bed Bath & Beyond said it would review Cohen's letter. Shares of the highly shorted company were up about 60% at $26 on Monday. 
Short interest in the company has risen 12% over the past week, with 30.9 million shares shorted, about 33.3% of the free float, S3 Partners said. The analytics company expects the trend to reverse on the back of the RC Ventures news this morning.
Bed Bath & Beyond was a part of the meme stocks phenomenon last year where retail investors fueled eye-popping rallies in certain shares coordinating through online message boards Reddit and Stocktwits, costing short sellers billions of dollars. 
Cohen is pushing for changes after three activists and the company reached a settlement in 2019 where four new directors were added to the board. The group criticized the retailer for failing to adapt to shoppers' growing preferences to buy online.
Soon after the settlement, the company hired Mark Tritton as CEO, but Cohen said Tritton has failed to navigate supply chain volatility and presided over a 14% drop in core sales from a year ago in the most recent quarter.
Still Tritton was paid about $27 million over the past two fiscal years, Cohen said, noting it was far more than what CEOs earned at far bigger retailers including Macy's (NYSE:M), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS), and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR).

Cohen said he is focused on the long term and won't criticize management for laying the foundation for future value creation, underscoring his own style at GameStop where he has given few details about how he plans to resuscitate the company.
At Bed Bath & Beyond, Cohen wants the company to streamline what he calls a ""scattershot strategy"" and consider separating the buybuy Baby chain or selling the whole company, which he says might be better off owned by a private equity company.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 02:38PM ET</span>","Analysis-Ukraine invasion sets back Musk's dream for cheaper EVs, for now","By Hyunjoo Jin
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Surging raw materials costs, made worse by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, could set back the dream of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk and other auto executives to roll out more affordable electric vehicles.
Rising prices of nickel, lithium and other materials threaten to slow and even temporarily reverse the long-term trend of falling costs of batteries, the most expensive part of EVs, hampering the broader adoption of the technology, said Gregory Miller, an analyst at industry forecaster Benchmark Mineral Intelligence.
And that is on top of a supply chain already snarled by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global chip shortage.
""Rising raw material prices certainly have the potential to delay the timeline on cost parity between EV and ICE (NYSE:ICE) vehicles, which could hamper the wider adoption of EVs,"" Miller said, referring to internal-combustion engine vehicles that dominate the market. 
This year could mark the first year-over-year increase in the average price of lithium-ion battery cells, he said. 
The conflict in Ukraine has only raised the stakes, pushing nickel and aluminium prices to record highs on Monday on growing fears exports from leading producer Russia could be disrupted. Lithium prices also have increased, more than doubling since year end, as supply fell short of rising demand. 
Russia’s largest miner Nornickel produces around 20% of the world’s supplies of high purity class 1 nickel, which is used in EV batteries, according to Benchmark Mineral Intelligence. Russia is also a large provider of aluminum, used in batteries.
To be sure, oil prices, which jumped to the highest levels since 2008 on Monday, could serve as a counterbalance, spurring greater interest in EVs after years of growing demand for gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
Rising EV prices - marked by hikes over the past year by Tesla and startup Rivian Automotive - matter because mainstream consumers are not going to pay a massive premium for a technology that many do not yet fully embrace.
The average EV sold for almost $63,000 in January in the United States, about 35% higher than the overall industry average for all vehicles of just over $46,000, according to research firm Cox Automotive. 
While consumers worry less now about being stranded without power on the roadside, price remains a major concern, according to a Cox survey.
SLOWER EV ADOPTION
""Anything that adds to the cost will impede EV adoption,"" Cox analyst Michelle Krebs said. 
EVs made up about 9% of total global vehicle sales last year according to the International Energy Agency, and consulting firm AlixPartners expects that share to hit about 24% by 2030.
More than half of consumers are not prepared to pay $500 extra upfront to buy an EV, despite lower operating costs, according to a 2021 study by OC&C Global Speedometer on consumers in the United States, China and other countries.
That could put vehicle makers in a bind if they want to attract mainstream buyers, rather than luxury customers to whom they currently cater. 
Tesla raised the price for its least expensive Model 3 sedan by 18% to $44,990 since December 2020, as supply chain woes weigh. Musk also said in January that Tesla is not developing a $25,000 car he promised during 2020 battery day, saying there are too many things on his plate. 
Some U.S. dealers have taken advantage of vehicle shortages to charge more for EVs, sparking warnings from automakers like Hyundai and Ford.
Rivian tried last week to push through a 20% price increase on its electric pickups and SUVs to offset higher parts costs, but retreated for those who had already placed orders when faced with a backlash that included possible sale cancellations.
Another EV startup, Lucid Group Inc, has not raised prices yet, but Chief Financial Officer Sherry House said in February the company was ""definitely studying price"" to offset higher supply chain costs.
In China, lithium price hikes have pressured the makers of such entry-level models as Great Wall's Ora EV and Wuling Hong Guang's Mini EV because they have less room to push through a higher price tag, investors said.
For startups, the pressure is particularly intense.
""If you're a small company, you don't have the ability to tell your suppliers to give you a lower price,"" said Brett Smith, technology director at Center for Automotive Research. 
Battery makers typically have long-term contracts with automakers, under which prices rise to reflect the increased cost of key raw materials such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, industry officials said. 

LG Energy Solution, a supplier to Tesla and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), said raw materials account for 70% or 80% of the cost of its batteries.
Benchmark Mineral Intelligence said battery producers started increasing lithium-ion cell prices late last year in response to the higher raw material prices they had seen throughout 2021.

ROME (Reuters) -Prime Minister Mario Draghi has approved a decree allowing Italy's state broadcaster RAI to cut its holding in towers unit Rai Way below 51%, three government officials said, in a move expected to trigger sector consolidation.
The decree could pave the way for merger talks between Rai Way and EI Towers, the officials said, a long-mooted tie-up that would create a group worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in the television and radio mast sector.
Rome is reversing a provision made in 2014, when Italy ruled that at least 51% of Rai Way should remain in public ownership due to the strategic importance of its infrastructure.
The decree needs approval from Italy's audit court before it can enter into force, the sources told Reuters.
EI Towers launched a takeover bid for Rai Way in 2015, but this was thwarted by the centre-left coalition government of former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.
At that time, former conservative Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's family controlled EI Towers through broadcaster Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY) and Renzi did not want to see the media magnate take control of Rai Way's assets.
""Had it been done then, there could have been synergies on investments to repurpose spectrum bands,"" Equita SIM senior analyst Stefano Gamberini said.
""But a tie-up would still create a more profitable player with greater cash generation capacity.""
RAI holds 65% of Rai Way, while EI Towers is now 60% controlled by fund F2i and 40% owned by MediaForEurope (MFE), which is Mediaset's new name.
The book value of MFE's 40% stake in unlisted EI Towers is around 437 million euros, based on MFE's 2020 financial statements, implying an overall valuation of EI Towers at more than 1 billion euros.
Listed in 2014, Rai Way has a market capitalisation of approximately 1.3 billion euros.
Gamberini said Rai Way's very low debt burden, currently in line with its core profit, would rise in a tie-up with EI Towers but still leave room for an extraordinary dividend Equita estimated could top 1 euros per share.
RAI has traditionally been subject to political influence and the potential merger of its towers arm with a private player is opposed by several ruling politicians.
Michele Anzaldi, a lawmaker in Renzi's Italia Viva party and member of an influential parliamentary committee supervising the state broadcaster, told Reuters the government's move was ""a grave measure, taken without any transparency on what this extra cash in RAI's coffers will be used for.""
According to one of the sources, governance agreements between RAI and the shareholders of Rai Way's prospective merger partner will ensure Italian strategic interests in any deal.

Draghi's office, RAI and F2i declined to comment. Rai Way, EI Towers and MFE were not immediately available for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -United Airlines said on Monday it has indefinitely suspended two flights to India after halting flights that flew over Russia last week.
The Chicago-based airline said last week it had stopped service between San Francisco and Delhi and between Newark, New Jersey, and Mumbai. The airline said it plans to continue flying to Delhi from both Chicago and Newark.
The Biden administration last week joined the European Union and Canada in banning Russian airlines from U.S. airspace.

United's last Delhi-to-San Francisco and Mumbai-to-Newark flights were on March 2. The Mumbai flight had to stop in Bangor, Maine, on the way to Newark. United's last U.S.-departing legs of those two flights to India were on Feb. 28.
Without access to Russian airspace some international flights to Asia are taking significantly longer routes and some must make a stop. Prior to the current turmoil, about 1,000 U.S. flights a week -- including many cargo flights -- typically flew over Russia, officials said.

(Reuters) - The number of women employed in senior management of the UK financial sector will take 30 years to reach parity with men at the current pace, a UK government-backed initiative said on Monday as it announced steps to kick start ""urgent action"".
The Woman in Finance Charter (WIFC) was founded in 2016 by the Treasury in the form of a voluntary agreement among over 400 institutions, including the Bank of England, to push for equal gender representation in the financial sector. 
Yet the proportion of women in senior management roles has increased by only 1% to 32% in the two years to 2020, said Amanda Blanc, chief executive of British insurer  Aviva  (LON:AV) and ""champion"" of the initiative.
""Progress towards gender equality in the financial sector remains frustratingly low,"" Blanc said. ""Women, companies and society cannot afford to wait 30 years when we can achieve this in 10.""
In a paper co-published with Bain & Co on the eve of International Women's day, the WIFC, drawing on the results of a survey issued to all signatories, outlined some guidelines to close the current gender gap. 
Its recommendations include a commitment to interview 50% women for roles at all levels, offer flexible options for all job and vacancies, advocate zero tolerance towards exclusionary behaviour and hold CEOs financially accountable for gender targets.

The research showed gender diversity is often not seen as a business issue and prioritised accordingly, with only 18% of signatories conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis linked to corporate initiatives.
""We've got to work quicker and harder, for the sake of women, for the sake of society and because a more diverse business is a more productive and innovative one,"" said Blanc.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 01:40PM ET</span>",UK chairman of Polymetal among 'mass exodus' from Russian firms,"By Sachin Ravikumar
(Reuters) -Board members at Russian companies, including the British chairmen of gold and silver producer Polymetal and metals and hydropower group EN+, have quit in response to the conflict in Ukraine.
Polymetal said on Monday Chairman Ian Cockerill and five other non-executive independent directors — Ollie Oliveira, Tracey Kerr, Italia Boninelli, Victor Flores and Andrea Abt — had left the London-listed company's board.
Polymetal gave no further details of the departures that coincide with concerns over the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions on Russia.
Russia has called the campaign it launched on Feb. 24 a ""special military operation.""
Directors realise ""the optics of being linked to these businesses are toxic,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
""As soon as the (British) Institute of Directors, hardly an organisation known for its radicalism, pushed for Britons involved to take the jump this mass exodus was almost an inevitability,"" Mould said.
The lobby group last week called on British directors to end any involvement in governance roles in the Russian economy.
Polymetal's London-listed shares fell 85% over the last two weeks, although they rebounded on Monday. The London Stock Exchange said it cancelled some trades in Polymetal on Monday after an unusual 726% jump in its shares in early trading.
EN+ Chairman Gregory Barker is also stepping down after more than four years in the role, the company announced on Monday.
Barker is a former British minister from the Conservative Party and several British politicians have said he should fully cut links with EN+ and its sanctioned Russian founder Oleg Deripaska, the Sunday Times reported. Another EN+ board member, independent director Joan MacNaughton, also resigned.
Barker will be replaced by Christopher Bancroft Burnham, a U.S. national. Barker could lead a new company that EN+ is considering carving out from its aluminium business Rusal.
Russia-focused gold miner Nordgold also said four of its directors - Michael Nossal, Brian Beamish, David Morgan and John Munro - stepped down from the board effective immediately. 
Nossal, who had been non-executive chair, is an Australian national, Morgan is British while Beamish and Munro are South African. Nordgold, a private company, had planned to list in London but postponed its IPO in June last year. 
London-listed Russian internet group VK said on Monday three of its non-executive directors — Jaco Van Der Merwe, Charles Searle and Mark Remon Sorour — as well as Chief Financial Officer Matthew Hammond had resigned.
Russian steelmaker Evraz said on Monday non-executive director Sandra Stash was leaving its board with immediate effect.

Shares in London-listed Evraz have fallen by nearly 80% over the last two weeks but recovered some losses on Monday and were up 51% by 1245 GMT. Polymetal's shares were last up 18% at 199.80 pence.
Polymetal also said in its statement that its website may be temporarily unavailable following a recent cyber attack.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 01:20PM ET</span>",U.S. EPA proposing rules to cut emissions from heavy trucks,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Monday said it was proposing new rules to cut smog-forming and greenhouse gas emissions from heavy duty vehicles.
The EPA is proposing to require cuts in nitrogen oxide emissions from heavy trucks that would result in a drop of 47% to 61% by 2045, the first proposed cuts to NOx for heavy duty trucks since 2001. The new standards would begin in the 2027 model year.
The administration also proposes https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-03/hd2027stds-nprm-2022-03.pdf stricter new greenhouse gas emissions standards for some types of heavy vehicles. 
""These new standards will drastically cut dangerous pollution by harnessing recent advancements in vehicle technologies from across the trucking industry as it advances toward a zero-emissions transportation future,"" EPA Administrator Michael Regan said.
The Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association said it would work ""with EPA to ensure that the final version of today’s rule is practical, technically feasible, cost-effective, and will result in the necessary fleet turnover to achieve the nation’s environmental objectives.""
The group noted engines made after 2010 emit roughly 30 times less NOx than those made before 2010, but only about 50% of the fleet has turned over. 
The EPA also proposes lengthening emission warranty periods.
The EPA said the rules would dramatically improve air quality could reduce up to 2,100 fewer premature deaths and 3.1 million fewer cases of asthma symptoms and other health issues.
EPA separately plans to set new greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles as soon as 2030.
The EPA estimates the program will cost manufacturers $19 billion to $31 billion through 2045 but will have net benefits of up to $220 billion.

EPA said the rules could result in up to 2% increase in Class 8 trucks in the months before the 2031 standards begin and a commensurate decrease in sales in the year after they take effect.
Separately, the Transportation Department announced $1.5 billion in funding to help state and local governments purchase electric transit buses and low-emission models and $2.2 billion in funding to 35 transit agencies in 18 states.

LONDON (Reuters) - European asset managers Carmignac and Fidelity International will no longer buy Russian securities, they said on Monday, joining a string of fund managers who have made similar announcements since Russia invaded Ukraine.
U.S. value investor Brandes Investment Partners also said it had put a moratorium on deploying new capital to Russian securities.
Asset managers such as BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) and abrdn have already said they are halting purchases of Russian securities or plan to reduce existing holdings as western governments impose tough sanctions on Russia.
But efforts by investors to cut positions have been complicated by a Russian ban on local brokers from selling securities held by foreigners. 
""We have decided not to purchase any Russian securities until further notice,"" Carmignac, which has 42 billion euros ($45.6 billion) of assets under management, said in a statement.
""We are committed to divesting from any remaining Russian securities in our portfolios, considering extra-financial aspects as well as market conditions, in order to preserve the interests of our clients, our primary objective.""
The firm's emerging market fund Carmignac Portfolio EM Debt had the world's longest Russia debt position in January at over 43%, industry tracker Morningstar data shows.
Carmignac has already cut its position in Russian debt as well as in shares and the rouble, a spokesperson said.
""Since the end of January, we have adopted a more cautious position and have either reduced our exposures in the wake of the deterioration of the situation and/or implemented some hedging strategies,"" it said. 
Carmignac funds that contain Russian assets have no more than 2% in Russia, the spokesperson added.
Fidelity International said it would not invest in Russia and Belarus ""for the foreseeable future"" and was looking at ways to cut its existing exposure.
The asset manager said it had been marking down prices of Russian securities in its funds and that where there is no trade, prices could be adjusted to zero.
Vanguard Group also said that it had implemented international sanctions imposed against Russian institutions and is working to further reduce its exposure to Russia.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said its London-listed global emerging markets income trust had only 0.25% in Russian equities as of March 4, versus 3.6% at the end of January.
Invesco said its exposure to Russia and Ukraine was ""very small"".

The biotech firm fell as much as 7.3% on Monday amid a broader market selloff and has erased more than $50 billion in value this year. Investors were concerned over the future revenue of Covid-19 vaccines and increasing competition in the space. The stock has lost more than 70% from its record closing high of $484.47 set in August 2021. 
“Increasing competition and lack of visibility” about future sales has led to a loss of investor interest across the Covid-19 complex, Oppenheimer analyst Hartaj Singh, who has a market perform rating on Moderna, said in an interview. 
Moderna soared during the pandemic as it raced to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. Its 143% gain last year made it the third-best stock in the S&P 500. It’s been on a breakneck ascent upward since debuting in 2018, skyrocketing by 434% in 2020. 
By 2022, investors were looking ahead to future Covid-19 vaccine demand amid growing debate about the timing and need for boosters, as interest in pandemic-focused healthcare names waned. Impending Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war have also hurt sentiment across global stock markets. The S&P 500 Index has dropped 11% this year, while the Nasdaq 100 Index is down 17%.
Among other vaccine makers, BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) and  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc. have each fallen by at least 50% this year, while the S&P 500 Health Care Index has declined 7.9%. 
“I think there’s a Covid loss of interest,” SVB Leerink analyst Daina Graybosch, who has a market perform rating on BioNTech and does not cover Moderna, said in an interview. “I see it across the board.”

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 12:11PM ET</span>",TikTok war: How Russia's invasion of Ukraine played to social media's youngest audience,"By Sheila Dang and Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - When Russia invaded Ukraine last week, some of social media's youngest users experienced the conflict from the front lines on TikTok.
Videos of people huddling and crying in windowless bomb shelters, explosions blasting through urban settings and missiles streaking across Ukrainian cities took over the app from its usual offerings of fashion, fitness and dance videos. 
Ukrainian social media influencers uploaded bleak scenes of themselves wrapped in blankets in underground bunkers and army tanks rolling down residential streets, juxtaposed against photos of blooming flowers and laughing friends at restaurants that honored more peaceful memories of their hometowns.
They urged their followers to pray for Ukraine, donate to support the Ukrainian military and demanded Russian users in particular to join anti-war efforts.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which it has called a ""special operation,"" is the latest example of the central role TikTok has played in bringing news and current events to the app's large Gen Z audience. Its famed algorithm is known for serving trending content even if users do not follow certain people, allowing topics to quickly go viral among its 1 billion monthly users.
The app has become so influential in this conflict that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to ""TikTokers"" as a group that could help end the war, in a speech directed at Russian citizens. Some TikTokers picked up where the politician left off.
A Ukrainian travel blogger named Alina Volik, who has over 36,000 followers on TikTok, took a break from posting highlights of her trips to Egypt, Spain and Turkey, to upload videos of life in the invasion, of emergency backpacks filled with first aid supplies and of sealed windows to protect against glass shards in a blast. In TikTok videos posted on Monday, Volik also urged her international followers to watch her Instagram Stories to ""see the truth"" about Ukraine.
In an email to Reuters, Volik said she wanted to combat misinformation in the Russian news that the country's actions were a ""military operation"" rather than a war that is hurting Ukrainians.
Montages of residential buildings destroyed by missiles, empty grocery store shelves and long lines of cars piled up outside gas stations could be seen on the TikTok pages of top Ukrainian influencers.
""@zaluznik"" who has 2 million followers, posted one such montage on Sunday with the caption ""Russians open your eyes!""
Russian influencers have also taken to the app to share their reaction. Niki Proshin, who has over 763,000 TikTok followers, said in a video on Thursday that ""normal people"" in Russia do not support the war.
""None of my friends and none of the people I personally talk to supported today's events,"" he said, referring to the invasion of Ukraine.
On Monday, Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor demanded the app stop including military-related content in recommended posts to minors, saying much of the content was anti-Russian in character. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Online misinformation researchers warned that false information about the conflict were now mixed in with authentic ones and has spread widely on TikTok and other tech platforms including Meta Platforms's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube.
Footage of military simulator video game Arma 3, images of explosions from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Gaza Strip, old footage of heavy firing and animations of flying aircraft have been shared on social media sites as if they depict the Russian invasion of Ukraine last week.
""We continue to closely monitor the situation, with increased resources to respond to emerging trends and remove violative content, including harmful misinformation and promotion of violence,"" a TikTok spokesperson said, adding that it works with fact checking organizations. 
Some Ukrainian TikTok users have made it a mission to share information and spread awareness with Western audiences. 
""I want people to understand this is not a joke, this is a serious situation that Ukrainians face,"" Marta Vasyuta, 20, said in an interview on Monday.

One of Vasyuta's TikTok videos showed what appeared to be a missile in the sky with the caption ""Kyiv 4:23 am."" It had over 131,000 comments by Monday as users flooded the video to offer their prayers and express disbelief.
""Never thought I would get WAR updates on TIKTOK,"" commented one user.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has catapulted defence spending up the political agenda in Europe and could herald a new era of purchases led by Germany, according to weapons makers gathering at an arms fair in Saudi Arabia this week.
The World Defense Show, where Europe's Airbus, MBDA and Leonardo are exhibiting alongside nearly 600 other weapons makers, is taking place amid the largest assault on an European state in 70 years. 
The conflict has reignited interest in security issues after years of European defence spending cuts and fatigue following NATO failures in Afghanistan. 
Germany, which has long played down the role of its military in foreign policy, Denmark and Poland have all said they will ramp up defence spending with war at their doorstep.
""There was peace for decades and people thought there would be peace forever. Unfortunately, that assumption has been proven wrong,"" Hristo Ibouchev, the executive director of Bulgarian firearms and munitions maker Arsenal, told Reuters.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said Berlin could buy F-35 stealth warplanes from the United States, but also that future advanced weaponry would be purchased from European consortia.
The German budget this year will allocate 100 billion euros ($109 billion) for a one-time increase in defence spending, Scholz said on Feb. 27, which is more than double the entire 2021 defence bill of 47 billion euros.
""The German announcement alone is a new era of defence spending for the EU if it's followed through on,"" manager of Jane's Defence Budgets Andrew MacDonald told Reuters, predicting such a major cultural shift would likely see others follow suit.
Some executives were sceptical of any dramatic increase, bemoaning what they see as years of sluggish investment and predicting states would not follow through on new commitments. 
Others argued EU states, after years of Russian aggression like the 2014 annexation of Crimea, were already paying more attention to security and this war would just ramp plans up.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a special operation. 
""The defence role is changing dramatically,"" an European executive said, predicting higher spending not only because of the war but also because former U.S. President Donald Trump's ""American First"" policy underscored the need for self-reliance. 
At the fair, Russia's weapons makers displayed precision guided missiles and artillery like those used by its forces besieging Ukrainian cities.
Russian executives declined to comment on whether their firms could still be paid for exports amid Western sanctions on banks and other businesses aimed at crippling Russia's economy. 
Western executives said the sanctions would make it difficult for Russian firms to be paid, but not impossible.
Elsewhere, armoured vehicles and other weaponry at a near-empty Ukrainian booth will be sent back as soon as the trade show finishes to be used in the conflict.

""Ukraine is in martial law and everything that can be used for the Ukrainian army will be used for the Ukrainian army,"" said the sole representative of a Ukrainian state defence firm.

According to TheFly, the analyst cited a deep dive he did into global connectivity and subscriber penetration. Cahall was quoted by the stock market news site as saying net adds are ""more likely 20m or better than 15m or worse.""

Investing.com – Kohl’s Corporation (NYSE:KSS) stock traded 7.5% lower Monday as the retailer disclosed long-term growth targets that fell short of expectations.
The company's plans to grow sales by a low-single-digit percentage annually and make Sephora a $2 billion annual sales business come in at the time when the retailer has been under pressure from activist investors to consider a sale and unlock value from its real estate. One such investor, hedge fund Engine Capital which owns around 1% of the company, has been urging the department store chain to consider separation of its faster growing e-commerce business.
‘Sephora at Kohl’s’ stores is an attempt to position the company as a beauty destination. At these stores, customers can explore an assortment of prestige makeup, skincare, hair, and fragrance brands. The company plans to have 850 of them by 2023, it said last week, while disclosing its fourth quarter results.
For most retailers, digital is the faster growing business compared to their legacy physical stores. Financial investors thus see more value in them and consider the old businesses as dragging down the more lucrative piece, and hence the push for such sales. Kohl's statement today didn't reflect the company meeting those demands. 
Kohl’s also plans to open more than 100 smaller format shops to attract new customers over the next four years. CEO Michelle Gass told CNBC these stores would be around 35,000 square feet, compared to about 80,000 square feet that many Kohl’s outlets go up to.
The company said it will target operating margins of 7-8% annually and per share earnings growth of a mid-to-high single-digit percentage.
According to CNBC, Macellum Advisors, another activist investor, called Kohl’s results disappointing, saying it remained skeptical of the retailer’s future, given the current board of directors and management configuration.
Kohl’s fourth quarter total revenue rose about 6% to $6.5 billion. Adjusted EPS fell by 2 cents to $2.20."

The Big Four audit the books of a catalogue of blue-chip companies and their work is often key to businesses obtaining international investor backing.
""The EY global organisation will no longer serve any Russian government clients, state-owned enterprises or sanctioned entities and individuals anywhere in the world,"" EY said in a statement, citing Russia's military invasion of Ukraine.
""EY has commenced a restructuring of its Russian member firm to separate it from the global network.""

The move comes at a time when the Wall Street institution has been cutting down its international footprint by exiting non-core markets. Chief Executive Jane Fraser, who took the helm last year, has looked to simplify the bank and bring its profitability more in line with its peers.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's attempt to nix a lawsuit by shareholders accusing the Google parent company of fraudulently concealing a security glitch that left private user data exposed.
The justices left in place a lower court's ruling that revived the lawsuit brought over the 2018 incident that the company was slow to disclose, turning away Alphabet's appeal.
The lawsuit, led by the state of Rhode Island, was filed after the Wall Street Journal published an article in October 2018 that said Google concealed the exposure of private data for nearly 500,000 users of Google+ - a social network owned by Google - because it feared regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. The lawsuit accused the company of making false or misleading statements in violation of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act.
Alphabet's share price fell after the disclosure, reducing the Mountain View, California-based company's market value by more than $50 billion.
Google ultimately admitted it had discovered the data exposure in March 2018, though there was no evidence of misuse, and decided to shut down the consumer version of Google+.
U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White in San Francisco dismissed the lawsuit in February 2020, prompting the plaintiffs to appeal.

The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in June 2021 decided that the lawsuit raised a ""strong inference"" that Alphabet's then-Chief Executive Larry Page and his successor, Sundar Pichai, knew about the problem and an internal memo on security matters but intentionally concealed the information from investors.
The 9th Circuit credited the plaintiff's argument that Alphabet stayed silent to ""buy time"" and avoid the spotlight that Meta Platform's  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) was then under because Britain's Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from tens of millions of its users.

Investing.com --  Upwork  Inc. (NASDAQ:UPWK) shares dropped more than 6% at the start of Monday's session after the company suspended all of its business operations in Russia and Belarus and withdrew its previously issued first-quarter and full-year 2022 guidance.
Upwork said the suspension will take full effect by May 1, 2022, and start with shutting down support for new business generation in Russia and Belarus. 
""Over the coming days, customers in Russia and Belarus will no longer be able to sign up for new accounts, initiate new contracts, or be visible in search. Existing contracts with talent and clients in the region will remain open, with final billing due by May 1, 2022,"" the freelancing platform stated.
The withdrawal of guidance was put down to ""rapidly evolving, increased risks and uncertainties,"" and an ""untenable operational position and dire geopolitical situation associated with the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine.""
Around 10% of Upwork's total revenue in 2021 was derived from work where the talent or the client was located in the region. Ukraine represented approximately 6%, and Russia and Belarus represented about 4% combined. Nearly all such revenue emanated from work performed by talent inside the region for clients in other parts of the world.
Upwork said it has seen a ""meaningful decrease"" in activity from talent in the region, most notably in Ukraine, since the start of the invasion in late February.
The company said it has provided financial and other support, including paying certain expenses for team members aiming to relocate from the affected region. In addition, Upwork added that it has already incurred or committed several million dollars of other unplanned expenses, including a donation of $1 million to Direct Relief International, and expects to incur further costs as events unfold. 
As a result, Upwork explained that the unforeseen expenses and decreased activity from talent in the region will impact its first-quarter and full-year 2022 financial results, including revenue and adjusted EBITDA."

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Monday but were well off the lows posted overnight by futures contracts, as fears of a squeeze on global oil supplies receded a little. 
U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken had said on Sunday that the U.S. was actively talking with European allies about the possibility of imposing a full embargo on Russian oil, essentially putting 10% of world oil supply off limits and triggering a mad dash for alternative supplies. 
However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that his country wouldn't go along with any such initiative, arguing that there was no other way in the short term to guarantee European energy supply. Crude oil futures, which had surged as much as 17% overnight to a new 14-year high over $130 a barrel, fell back to trade below $120 a barrel by the opening on Wall Street.  That's still a level that has in the past led to widespread demand destruction and an economic slowdown.
By 9:40 AM ET (1440 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 253 points, or 0.8%, at 33,362 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite was effectively flat from Friday's close. All three had posted losses last week. 
Sentiment was also improved at the margins by the first sign of Russia tempering its demands with regard to finding a way to peace. Reuters quoted a Kremlin spokesman as saying that what it calls a 'special military operation' could end immediately, even without the replacement of the current Ukrainian government. However, its remaining demands - that Ukraine embrace neutrality and recognize the Russian conquest of Crimea and the independence of two breakaway 'republics' - are still unacceptable to a Ukrainian government that has been emboldened by the successful defense of nearly all the country's major cities and increasing signs of dysfunction in the Russian military. 
Among early movers, Bed Bath & Beyond stock (NASDAQ:BBBY) stood out with a 63% leap after news that Ryan Cohen, the founder of pet food company Chewy (NYSE:CHWY), had amassed a stake in the troubled retailer. Cohen has previously been welcomed as a savior for GameStop (NYSE:GME), another retailer trying to move beyond an outdated brick-and-mortar distribution model.  However, GameStop stock has struggled to keep the momentum Cohen gave it last year, when an army of retail investors bought into what they perceived as his vision for the company. GameStop stock was down 0.6% in early trading and is down 25% so far this year.
However, for the most part, stocks continued to slide on fears of the economic damage that the rise in global commodity prices and economic boycotts will do, notably in Europe, a key market for many U.S. companies.  Boeing (NYSE:BA) stock fell 0.8% after it said it will suspend purchases of titanium and titanium products from a joint venture that it has in Russia, a venture on which it relies for lightweight components for the aircraft such as the 787 Dreamliner. Problems in delivering the Dreamliner due to other production issues may have made that decision easier for the company. 
Boeing was joined over the weekend by Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX),  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) and accounting giants KPMG and PwC in pulling their products and services from Russia, while Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) further reduced the services they will offer in the country. The exodus of western companies from IKEA to Ford has put an increasingly harsh spotlight on those who have chosen to continue operating normally there, such as McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO).
Elsewhere, oil and gas companies continued to outperform on the prospect for windfall profits in the current quarter.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 2.3% and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 0.9%, while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) stock rose 3.2% after news that Carl Icahn has exited his stake in the company, removing a long-standing stock overhang. The company is also enjoying inflows from Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway  (NYSE:BRKb). "
1620,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 09:36AM ET</span>",Explainer-Russia could work around SWIFT ban but with high costs,"By Tom Bergin
(Reuters) - Western sanctions banning several Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments network with the potential threat of more to come if there is no end to the Ukraine conflict is likely to push Moscow to seek alternatives. 
Russia could in theory try to replace SWIFT's communications system that keeps international trade flowing smoothly. But any alternatives would add significant costs and risks for Russian businesses, money transfer experts said. The impact on Russia would be a reduction in imports and export volumes, at least in the short term, they added.
The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a secure messaging system for banks, which facilitates rapid cross-border payments. Senders of SWIFT's secure messages can be confident they will be acted upon, as recipients are contractually liable if they fail to respond.
Russia has become one of the top users of the system, having had a board seat since 2015 and with more than 300 Russian banks using it as their primary method of communicating with domestic and international banks. 
Here is a rundown of the potential alternatives and why it is not easy to replace SWIFT: 
RUSSIAN MESSAGING PLATFORM 
Russian banks could move to a messaging system developed by Russia's central bank - System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS). Last year, the central bank was reported as saying domestic interbank traffic could easily be transferred to this platform.
A spokesperson for the Russian Central Bank was not immediately available for comment. 
But the ""SWIFT analogue"", as the central bank calls it, has limitations. It only operates during weekday working hours, while SWIFT operates 24 hours a day, every day. Also, SPFS messages have size limitations potentially making it less able to handle more complex transactions.
The SPFS system also lacks international connectivity.
“Currently, international services are limited to countries such as Armenia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan,” analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said this week.
Russian banks could in theory use SPFS messaging to send international payments to a connected bank in one of the countries that belong to the network. This bank could then use SWIFT to pipe the instruction into the international banking system, said Alistair Milne, Professor of Financial Economics at Loughborough University.
But a sudden surge in transactions via such a route would be likely to attract the attention of international regulators, thereby deterring the non-Russian partner bank from continuing this activity.
Professor Markos Zachariadis of University of Manchester, author of a book on SWIFT, said even if regulators did not take action, the banks could soon find themselves ostracised by Western banks, which have grown wary of engaging in activity seen as undermining sanctions.
CHINA’S CIPS SYSTEM
Another possible response to a SWIFT ban would be for Russian banks to connect to China’s CIPS payment platform. However, China’s platform can only be used for settling payments in yuan.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley said only 1.9% of international payments are made in the Chinese currency, against around 40% for U.S. dollars, which limited the effectiveness of CIPS as a method for funding cross-border trade.
Also, since CIPS itself relies on the SWIFT network for its operations, piggybacking on CIPS could also be seen as a breach of a SWIFT ban, analysts said.
Indirect CIPs participants still need to go through SWIFT to complete settlements.
BESPOKE, BILATERAL SYSTEMS
A more suitable SWIFT alternative for Russian banks would be to set up bespoke, bilateral systems using phones, faxes or messaging Apps with an overseas partner who would take payment from importers of Russian goods and make payments to exporters to Russia. 
Such a system was created by one foreign lender when Iran was cut off from the SWIFT network by sanctions tied to its nuclear programme, a former SWIFT executive familiar with the matter said.
This required a small team of people processing payments on the basis of sending two faxes and making two phone calls for each transaction.
But however effective, such systems are also prone to error and face security challenges. While SWIFT is plugged straight into a bank’s systems, faxes or WhatsApp messages may involve manual transfer of data.

Errors and the necessity for extra checks to avoid them would raise costs and could make smaller ticket transactions uneconomic, industry experts said. 
“It’s not an easy workaround” Zachariadis said.

A joint research and development team from fictional secret agent James Bond's car brand and the battery company will design and develop battery packs and a battery management system. 
Aston Martin is the second carmaker customer for Britishvolt, which has also entered a battery partnership with Britain's Lotus.
By 2026 the Aston Martin plans to offer electric versions of all of its new models.
""Working together with Britishvolt, I believe we can create new technologies to power benchmark-setting Aston Martin electric cars that will match our reputation for high performance and ultra-luxury with the highest standards of sustainability,"" Aston Martin Chief Executive Tobias Moers said in a statement.
Last month Britishvolt launched a Series C funding round with a starting investment of 40 million pounds ($53 million) from mining giant Glencore (OTC:GLNCY).
It has also secured UK government backing for a battery plant project in northern England, unlocking 1.7 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in private funding.

When the 3.8 billion pound, 45 GWh Blythe plant is fully operational in 2027 it should be able to produce battery packs for more than 450,000 electric vehicles per year.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 has triggered an unprecedented wave of economic and financial sanctions from Western and allied governments, and of international firms suspending or ending business in Russia or with Russian companies.
In a statement, the Russian government said it was proposing a ""comprehensive package"", first introduced as an anti-crisis measure in 2020, to ""support the economy and business in the face of external sanctions"".
The measures will include state guarantees to enable the firms to restructure existing loans or take out new ones, as well as subsidies to help them recover costs.
The relevant firms will also be exempted from financial stress tests, the government said. 
Sectors that benefited from support during the COVID-19 crisis included banking and aviation.
President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday that Western sanctions on Russia were akin to a declaration of war and defended the invasion of Ukraine, saying Moscow needed to protect Russian speakers in Ukraine's east as well as its own interests.
The war and the sanctions have shattered the outlook for a commodity-dependent economy, already suffering 9% inflation before the invasion, that analysts had seen growing by around 2.5% this year in a poll conducted in January.
Moscow's stock exchanges have been closed since Feb. 25, after dropping sharply on news of the invasion.

But the rouble currency, which would usually have been supported by a surge in the price of oil, Russia's main export, has lost more than 40% of its value this year, despite the central bank more than doubling its benchmark interest rate to 20% last week.
On Monday, a holiday in Russia, it was being bid at 131.00 to the dollar in thin offshore trade, according to Refinitiv data. [RU/RUB]

BOSTON (Reuters) -Billionaire investor William Ackman has built a new stake in railroad operator  Canadian Pacific  (NYSE:CP), returning to one of his most profitable investments as rail firms eye a boost from the drive to cut carbon emissions and as manufacturing is brought back to the United States and Mexico from abroad.
Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management reported owning 2.8 million Canadian Pacific shares at the end of Dec. 31, 2021, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. That would value the stake at roughly C$280 million ($220 million) at the stock's closing price on Friday, a fraction of Canadian Pacific's market value of about C$92 billion.
Pershing Square had asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to delay disclosing its holding on a recent regulatory filing so that it could continue accumulating more stock. Ackman had told investors earlier this year that he had an undisclosed new position in the portfolio.
By Monday, Pershing Square owned an additional 12 million shares through forward contracts that it intends to exercise, Ackman said. The investment will make Pershing Square one of Canadian Pacific's top 20 shareholders.
With this new stake in Canadian Pacific, Ackman is going back to a company that had been one of Pershing Square's biggest winners, earning the firm some $2.6 billion on its investment.
Pershing Square first began buying into the railroad in September 2011, but was forced to sell in 2016 to pay back investors who were pulling out cash as the fund faced losses. Ackman called those sales one of the firm's ""greatest investment regrets."" 
Six years on Canadian Pacific is being run by Keith Creel, who took the top job in 2017 after his mentor Hunter Harrison left Canadian Pacific to run rival railway CSX Corp (NASDAQ:CSX).
""Keith and the team have done a superb job since,"" Ackman said, adding: ""We are delighted to again be an owner of this remarkable and growing franchise at a time when transcontinental rail infrastructure could not be more important for our economy and our continent.""
Creel engineered a major win last year when Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) after a protracted battle. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board still needs to give the deal full regulatory clearance.

The merger would set Canadian Pacific up as the first rail company to have a network that extends from Canada to Mexico.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 08:57AM ET</span>",Factbox-Airline hedging and surcharges offset some oil price pain,"(Reuters) -The price of oil has surged to its highest since 2008 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, adding to airline costs at a time when carriers have been struggling to recover from a pandemic-related collapse in demand.
Oil prices were already strong because of tight global supplies, but the conflict in Ukraine has sent prices into overdrive and the northwest European jet fuel price in the spot market has soared by 50% since Feb. 25 to $1,341 a tonne on Monday.
Malaysia's AirAsia on Saturday introduced fuel surcharges on tickets for the first time since 2015. Chinese airlines, meanwhile, raised fuel surcharges on domestic routes and Emirates, Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings have also raised surcharges recently.
Some airlines have oil hedges that will help to offset some of the price increase, but other carriers are fully unhedged, including U.S. majors United Airlines, American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), though the latter does own an oil refinery. 
Many carriers are also being squeezed by the need to fly longer routes to avoid Russian and Ukrainian airspace.
Air France KLM (OTC:AFLYY) 
The airline has hedged 72% of oil consumption for the first quarter and 63% for the second quarter at $90 a barrel, with smaller amounts hedged in the second half, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 17. 
Air New Zealand
The airline has hedged 1.34 million barrels of oil in the six months to June 30 and 707,500 barrels in the following half-year period, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 24. In late February it raised international fares by about 5%, citing rising oil prices and general cost inflation. 
Cathay Pacific Airways (OTC:CPCAY) 
The Hong Kong airline had hedged more than 60% of its expected first-quarter consumption and about half of its second-quarter consumption by the time of its interim results last August, as well as lower amounts in future quarters through 2023. Cathay will release full-year results on Wednesday. 
easyJet (LON:EZJ) 
The European airline 60% hedged for fuel in the financial year to Sept. 30 at about $504 per metric tonne, it said on Jan. 27.
IAG (LON:ICAG)
The British Airways owner is hedged against volatile crude prices for two years, Chief Executive Luis Gallego said on Feb. 25. It has covered about 60% for the whole of 2022.
Based on a fuel price scenario of $900 a tonne, the company would be paying $690 a tonne in the first quarter after hedging 70% of its fuel and foreign exchange, a Feb. 25 results presentation shows.
In the second quarter the price would rise to $750 after hedging 65% of fuel and foreign exchange, to $775 in the third quarter with 56% of its fuel and foreign exchange hedged and $795 in the final quarter with a little less than half of its fuel and foreign exchange hedged.
Lufthansa 
The German airline is 63% hedged in 2022 at a break-even price of $74 a barrel, it said in a results presentation on March 3.
Qantas Airways
The Australian airline has more than 90% of its fuel hedged for the six months to June 30, it said in a results presentation on Feb. 24. It also has a lower level of hedges in place for the following half-year period.
Ryanair 
The budget carrier is 80% hedged on fuel out to 2023, but rising prices will still cost the group about 50 million euros ($54.2 million) over the next 12 months, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on March 2, adding that Ryanair would not introduce fuel charges for the summer.
Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY)
The airline hedged 30% of its oil needs at an average Brent crude price of $57 a barrel for the six months to March 31, it said in a results presentation in November. It had also hedged 40% of its needs at an average price of $60 for the following five quarters. It said on Monday that it had no updates from guidance in November.
Wizz Air 
The European budget airline on Monday said it has covered its fuel costs for the next four months with zero-cost hedges. 

For March, it has covered half its needs with a price ceiling of $1,172 a tonne and 40% of its needs for the first quarter to end-June at $1,142 a tonne. Its financial year ends on March 31, 2023.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Travel in Asia-Pacific is trailing the rest of the world and should expect a bumpy recovery, a Booking.com executive said on Monday, as countries in the region have been slower to open borders than other destinations. 
With North Asian countries still largely restricting entry and Southeast Asian countries reopening cautiously, the region's tourism recovery will not be quick, Laura Houldsworth, the online travel agency's managing director for Asia-Pacific said in an interview. 
The region should also expect a hit from fewer arrivals from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine triggered a spike in flight cancellations last month. Beach destinations in Thailand, Indonesia, India and the Maldives are usually popular among Russian tourists.
""Any of these situations will have people rethink their travel plans,"" she said, noting that the conflict would have an impact on travel demand among Eastern Europeans in general.
Booking.com, a subsidiary of U.S. company Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) Inc, last week suspended its operations in Russia, joining a host of other Western firms aiming to isolate Moscow.
The Amsterdam-based company has stopped all bookings to Russia, Houldsworth said, while outbound travel is expected to ""depress significantly"". 
However, a recent flurry of reopenings in the region was cause for optimism, said Houldsworth, pointing to Australia, Cambodia and the Philippines, which have dropped quarantine requirements for vaccinated tourists. Vietnam will soon follow suit. 
The Indonesian island of Bali on Monday welcomed its first foreign tourists under similarly relaxed travel restrictions. Meanwhile, Thailand resumed its quarantine waiver in February, but local hotel operators have called for further easing, saying the entry process is still too onerous.

Destinations with less cumbersome entry rules will have an advantage, and countries that still have entry restrictions in place like South Korea, Japan and China will be watching the impact of recent re-opening programmes closely, Houldsworth said. 
""The message is: simpler the better for travellers,"" she said.

Investing.com – Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) stock was up 2.4% in premarket Monday as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict pushes prices of farm-based commodities to record highs, both the countries being big exporters of many of them.
The price of wheat rocketed past $10 a bushel last week for the first time in more than a decade, according to Bloomberg. Corn also leaped to a nine-year high and soybean oil edged down from a record. Tight supplies, owing to harvest setbacks and labor shortages, had anyway kept corn prices elevated even before the current crisis erupted.
Russia and Ukraine account for about a quarter of global wheat and barley trade and a fifth of corn. The invasion and ensuing sweeping sanctions from the U.S. and its allies in Europe have sent the grain markets into turmoil.
Farming activity in Ukraine has been disturbed, too, as many farmers have rushed to perform military roles. Wheat and barley were sown before winter, but the fate of how much can be gathered now hangs in the balance, Bloomberg said.
Ukraine accounts for around half of global sunflower oil exports and is scheduled to seed the crop April-May. That’s around the same time as corn, part of the nation’s spring planting campaign.
ADM shuttered its facilities in Ukraine in the last week of February as Russia began an invasion of its neighbor. This included an oilseed crush plant and a grain export terminal."

""Our mobility business is bouncing back from Omicron much faster than we expected,"" Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said. He said consumers were eager to book rides for travel, commuting or nightlife.
Khosrowshahi said gross bookings for airports, which are among the most profitable routes for Uber, were up over 50% month-on-month in February and headed to be one of the strongest ever in the upcoming travel season.
Several companies are also bringing staff back to offices over two years after the pandemic forced many to shift to working from home. 
During the peak of the pandemic, Uber's delivery business thrived as consumers became more dependent on ordering food and groceries online. 

Ride-hail trips in February remain only 10% below pre-pandemic 2019 levels in the same month, Uber said. February mobility gross bookings had recovered to 95% compared with February 2019.
On the delivery side, gross bookings reached an all-time high in February, the company said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Danone fell 3% on Monday after the French food group said it was suspending investments in Russia and had closed one of its two factories in Ukraine, following Russia's invasion of the country. 
However, the world's largest yoghurt maker, which announced the measures on Sunday, said it would continue to sell dairy and baby food in Russia, its third largest market after France and Spain.
Danone's new CEO Antoine de Saint-Affrique was among French bosses who met with President Emmanuel Macron on Friday to discuss the situation in Ukraine, a company spokesman said on Monday, adding it was too early to assess the financial impact of the decisions announced on Sunday.
Danone, which generates around 6% of its sales in Russia and Ukraine combined, controls Russian dairy brand Prostokvashino. 
It employs 1,000 people in Ukraine and 8,000 in Russia.
Danone shares had already fallen 9.9% since the start of this year before Monday's decline. 
Danone General Secretary Laurent Sacchi said in a statement on the company’s website on Sunday that the company will continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine, and would apply any decisions made by the French authorities.
""We have decided to suspend all investment projects in Russia but currently maintain our production and distribution of fresh dairy products and infant nutrition to still meet the essential food needs of the local population,"" he said.

Danone is due to hold a Capital Market Day on Tuesday when Saint-Affrique will give details of his turnaround strategy for the group.

Icahn’s exit brings to end a three-year-long relationship that was much thorny in the first year. The two finally reached a settlement at the onset of the pandemic.

Investing.com -- U.S. stocks are seen opening sharply lower Monday, with surging oil prices on the back of the Ukraine/Russia conflict prompting fears of global stagflation..
At 7 AM ET (1200 GMT), the Dow Futures contract was down 400 points, or 1.2%, S&P 500 Futures traded 50 points, or 1.2%, lower and Nasdaq 100 Futures dropped 190 points, or 1.4%.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine heads toward the two-week mark and shows no signs of easing, with the key southeastern port city of Mariupol under bombardment.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy asked the international community earlier Monday to provide Ukraine with military aircraft and to boycott Russian oil, oil products, and other exports.
He’s unlikely to get aircraft, but U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stated that the United States and European allies are exploring banning imports of Russian oil.
This resulted in crude prices surging to levels not seen since 2008, while the national gasoline average topped $4 a gallon, according to AAA.
 At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 7.1% higher at $123.86 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 6.8% to $126.16.
Soaring commodity prices have raised fears of even greater inflation, with data due on Thursday expected to show U.S.CPI climbed to 7.9% year-on-year in February, after January's four-decade high of 7.5%. 
With Friday’s monthly labor market report showing the U.S. economy is in rude health, such elevated inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates in a more forceful manner than the market is currently pricing in.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week he would support a 25 basis point interest rate increase at the central bank's upcoming meeting next week but added that he would be ""prepared to move more aggressively"" later if inflation does not subside as quickly as expected.
In corporate news, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is likely to be in the spotlight following a report in The Wall Street Journal that Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Co-Founder Ryan Cohen has built a large stake in the retailer and is pushing for changes.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will likely announce a new low-cost version of its iPhone SE with 5G capabilities at its annual spring product launch event on Tuesday, analysts say.
The iPhone maker is also expected to launch a new version of the iPad Air and a high-end Mac Mini at the event.
Apple's iPhone SE is currently priced at $399. CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Apple could attract more price-sensitive consumers if the price remains the same for the new version.
""It could potentially provide upside to our unit iPhone estimate for 2022 if they keep that price point unchanged,"" Zino said. ""The iPhone SE really caters well to a lot of first-time buyers on the iPhone ecosystem that may be younger individuals, where their parents are going out there buying that device.""
The new phone would be the first update to the iPhone SE model in two years and is rumored to come with an improved camera and a faster processor.
The United States, Japan and Western Europe have been the top markets for iPhone SE sales in recent years, said analyst Ryan Reith of IDC. Reith said these regions will likely remain the top markets after the anticipated launch of the third-generation iPhone SE.
""We probably won't see big geography shifts,"" Reith said, adding that he expects the new iPhone SE to account for 10% of iPhone shipments globally after the launch.
IPhones with 5G capabilities have been a big part of Apple's focus for its flagship product, with its latest-model iPhone 13 showing off custom 5G antennas and radio components for faster speeds as customers look for powerful devices with better connectivity.
But some analysts still point to the limitations of 5G technology globally.
""Currently in most countries in the world, that (5G) technology simply isn't good enough to create a unique and differentiated experience ... the fact that the iPhone SE comes with 5G is more a way to enable users to leverage 5G when that technology evolves over the next year or two,"" Canalys research analyst Runar Bjørhovde said.
Zino said he does not anticipate services or accessories launches at the Tuesday event, though an unexpected announcement in the services sector is still possible.
Apple usually hosts three events every year to launch new products, starting in spring and announcing the launch of its latest iPhone range just before the holiday shopping season.

In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Apple said on March 1 it has paused all product sales in Russia. The company also said it has stopped all exports into its sales channels in the country and limited Apple Pay and other services in Russia.

1643,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 05:41AM ET</span>",Japan Inc feels the heat over Russia ties as rivals shun Moscow,"By Yuka Obayashi, Maki Shiraki and Yoshifumi Takemoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese firms are under deepening pressure over their ties to Russia and are scrambling to assess their operations, company and government insiders say, after Western rivals halted businesses and condemned Moscow for invading Ukraine.
While environmental, social and governance (ESG) investors have previously targeted Japan Inc for use fossil fuels, scrutiny over Russia could become intense. Executives say privately they are worried about reputational damage, a sign corporate Japan is - however reluctantly - becoming more responsive to pressure on social issues. 
Japan's trading houses, commodities giants long seen as quasi-governmental arms integral to Japan's energy supply, have big ties to Russia. Last year Russia was Japan's second-biggest supplier of thermal coal and its fifth-largest of both crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG).
""The energy issue has implications for national and public interest, so it has to be discussed properly with the government,"" said one trading house insider, who like others spoke on condition of anonymity. 
""But we also have to think about our corporate value and about how we explain this to our shareholders. It's a difficult position.""
Mitsui & Co and Mitsubishi Corp have stakes in the giant Sakhalin-2 LNG project Shell (LON:RDSa) is now exiting. Itochu Corp and Marubeni Corp have invested in the Sakhalin-1 oil project that  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) is pulling out of. 
Mitsui and Mitsubishi said they would consider the situation, together with the Japanese government and partners. Itochu and Marubeni declined to comment on their plans related to Sakhalin-1.
Japanese firms have largely said they are watching the situation. Those that have halted activity have tended to cite supply-chain disruption rather than human rights. 
A senior executive at an automaker said management at his company was holding daily meetings to gauge the impact of financial sanctions and the implication for parts supply.
""We're also discussing reputational risk and how to deal with the news from the point of view of human rights and ESG - of course we're aware of that,"" said the executive.
""But we can't just immediately decide we're going to pull out because we can't tell how long the Ukraine crisis will continue.""
Japanese firms typically do not face the same level of scrutiny from shareholders, customers, regulators and even their own employees that Western companies now confront, said Jana Jevcakova, the international head of ESG at shareholder services firm Morrow Sodali.
""Most Japanese companies still don't have a majority of international institutional investors. Those that do will very shortly, or already are, feel the pressure.""
RELIANT ON RUSSIA
A manufacturing executive said his company felt a responsibility to local staff in Russia but was also concerned about the risk of saying nothing.
""Japanese companies have been slow to react. Too slow. And I can't agree with that,"" he said. ""If we keep quiet and just continue manufacturing and selling, we will likely face a risk to our reputation."" 
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has unveiled steps to help cushion the blow from higher oil prices, but it is unclear what the government will do about broader dependence on Russia. Japan's imports from Russia totalled around $11 billion in 2020. 
Government officials say privately Japan cannot just walk away from Russian energy, even as they acknowledge the peril.
""If Japan remains invested in Russia, that itself runs the risk of drawing criticism"" should the conflict be prolonged, said an official close to Kishida.
In a moment of rare outspokenness for the leader of a state-owned lender, the head of the Japan Bank for International Cooperation said last week that ""it would not be right"" for companies to stick to business as usual in Russia.
 Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp and Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co have stopped exports to Russia, citing logistics issues, with Toyota halting local production.
Nissan, Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY) Corp and Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp are all likely to stop local production when parts inventories run out, they say. Japan's most prominent companies will likely feel more heat as Western investors themselves pare back ties to Russia. 

""We believe good corporate citizenship includes support of governmental sanctions, as well as closing down activities that might fall outside the current sanctions,"" said Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at Danish pension fund AkademikerPension, which has $21.3 billion of assets under management and $342 million exposure to Japanese equities.
""From a financial point of view this might mean companies suffer short-term losses, but given the long-term stigmatisation of Russia that is likely, the long-term cost will not change much.""

Investing.com – Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) stock surged 47% in premarket trade Monday on a report in The Wall Street Journal that Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) Co-Founder Ryan Cohen has built a large stake in the retailer and is pushing for changes.
According to the report, Cohen, who also serves as the Chairman of videogames retailer GameStop (NYSE:GME)  has a 9.8% stake in Bed Bath, making him a top-five shareholder in the company. As of Friday, Bed Bath had a market cap of $1.55 billion. The stock is down over 42% in the last year against the near 13% rise in S&P500.
Cohen claims that Bed Bath’s strategy is failing to stem sustained market share losses, the WSJ report said. He wants the chain to simplify its structure and consider a sale or separation of BuyBuy Baby, its brand of stores selling a wide range of baby products including strollers, car seats, and diapers. He believes BuyBuy is worth several billion dollars. Cohen has even suggested selling the entire company, WSJ said.
Other than those options, he wants the company to narrow the focus of its turnaround plan and maintain the right inventory mix to meet demand.
The chain’s turnaround plan has so far centered around reducing the number of products in stores and launching new private labels.
Like most retailers, Bed Bath has been troubled by surging inflation and extended supply chains as factories in China and Vietnam have had temporary shutdowns owing to the pandemic. That has resulted in inadequate inventories at stores at a time when buyers are keen to shop after the pandemic. "

Investing.com – ADRs of Shell (NYSE:SHEL) traded 2.7% higher in premarket Monday after talks of the U.S. pushing for a ban on Russian oil jolted the markets.
The Biden administration is considering whether to prohibit Russian oil imports into the U.S. without the participation of allies in Europe, at least initially, Bloomberg reported. Crude prices soared, climbing to their 14-year high.
Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer behind the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. The OPEC+ member exported 7.8 million barrels a day of crude, condensate, and oil products in December last year, according to the International Energy Agency, supplying key fuels such as diesel, fuel oil, vacuum gas oil, and a petrochemical feedstock known as naphtha to buyers across Europe, the U.S., and Asia.
Brent Oil Futures touched a high of $130.89 earlier in the day before giving up some of the gains to trade near $126, still up 6.3% at 04:30 ET. Crude Oil WTI Futures traded just over $123 after retreating from a high of $130.33.
Brent’s backwardation, a market structure where prompt barrels are more expensive than later-dated ones, rose to $5.17 a barrel, highlighting the rising anxiety about short-term supply, according to Bloomberg.
Shell got much flak last week for buying a cargo of Russia’s flagship crude at a record discount after saying it would limit business with the Communist country, including divesting from Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), a Russian majority state-owned energy company.
Defending its action, Shell cited concerns over market interruptions and supply security for ""the difficult decision"". It went on to commit putting profits from any Russian oil it purchases into a fund that will go towards humanitarian aid to Ukraine."

As a result, it shifted its tactical stance on global equities to neutral from most preferred, while it still likes Chinese stocks relative to other Asian markets and holds a most preferred view on global energy equities and the U.S. dollar. 
""Historically, geopolitical events—even those that have changed the course of history—have rarely left a long-lasting mark on markets. This speaks to maintaining long-term exposure to equities. But with markets volatile and outcomes uncertain, we believe investors should now review portfolio allocations,"" it said.

1647,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 04:54AM ET</span>",Morgan Stanley and Citi Strategists See Equities Storm Forming,"(Bloomberg) -- As equity markets sink around the world,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) strategists say a perfect storm looks to be gathering.
“Downside risk remains most acute over the next 6-8 weeks,” Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson wrote in a note to clients. “We are firmly in the grasp of a bear market that is incomplete in both time and price.”
Separately, Citi strategists led by Jamie Fahy said a global gauge tracking analyst estimates on corporate profits has turned negative for the first time since September 2020. This is a potential “game-changer,” eroding their conviction on the prospects of risk assets, they wrote.
Earnings delivery is “paramount” at a time when liquidity is being sucked out by central banks across the world, the Citi strategists said. “Removing this support could leave some indices floating on air.”
A ferocious rally in developed market stocks came to an abrupt end at the start of this year amid concerns that record inflation readings will cause central banks to aggressively tighten policy. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered another spike in commodity prices, adding to fears that economies are heading to a stagflationary shock.
Several major benchmark gauges across Europe have dropped more than 20% from their recent highs, while the S&P 500 is hovering around a 10% correction. With gas and oil prices soaring, Citi and Morgan Stanley strategists say “demand destruction” may now be unavoidable.
Optimists Wavering
“Any relief should be sold,” said Wilson. “We recommend staying defensively oriented by running less risk than normal and searching for companies with superior operational efficiency and earnings stability.”
While the Morgan Stanley strategist has consistently been one of Wall Street’s most outspoken bears, even optimists are now wavering.
UBS Global Wealth Management downgraded global and euro-area equities to neutral on Monday, saying Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has broadened the probability of distribution to equity market outcomes.”

1648,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 04:50AM ET</span>","UBS has limited Russia exposure, but sees risks of unexpected increases","ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS's direct exposure to Russia made up $634 million of the Swiss bank's total emerging market exposure of $20.9 billion at the end of 2021, the bank said in its annual report.
Switzerland's biggest bank said while its direct exposure was limited and had been reduced since year-end 2021 this could be affected by sanctions and other measures.
""Our current direct exposure to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus is limited,"" UBS said. ""However, market closures, the imposition of exchange controls, sanctions or other measures may limit our ability to settle existing transactions or to realise on collateral, which may result in unexpected increases in exposures.""
That included open transactions with Russian counterparties, including both Russian banks and other Russian entities, it said. 
Its Russian subsidiary additionally held some $51 million in net assets not reflected in the total amount.
The global banking industry has been thrown into turmoil since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as Western banks exposed face fallout from the resulting sanctions on Russia and as financial markets show signs of stress over the potential wider economic fallout.
UBS highlighted risks from heightened threat of cyber-attacks as well as the risk of not quickly identifying client activity subject to new sanctions.
""We are working to implement sanctions imposed by Switzerland, the US, the EU, the UK and others – all of which have announced unprecedented levels of sanctions against Russia and certain Russian entities and nationals,"" Chairman Axel Weber and Chief Executive Ralph Hamers said in a letter to shareholders.
UBS, the world's biggest wealth manager, said it had identified a small number of global wealth management clients subject to recently introduced sanctions, with total loans outstanding to such customers amounting to less than $10 million.

The Zurich-based bank said as of March 3 its wealth management business also had around $200 million in so-called Lombard loans - loans to wealthy customers secured against stocks or other assets - and secured financing backed by Russian assets as collateral.
The wealth management business's gross loans at end-2021 totalled $234.1 billion, based on the annual report.

Russian-issued Mastercard and Visa cards would be accepted within Russia until their expiry, the bank said,
The overseas ban also applies to cards issued by local subsidiaries of foreign banks, the bank said. 
Its announcement came after U.S. payments firms  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) said they were suspending operations in Russia, joining the list of companies that are severing business links with Russia..
The central bank added that many Russian banks plan to issue cards using UnionPay, a system it said was enabled in 180 countries. 
While several Russian banks already use UnionPay, others including Sberbank and Tinkoff could start issuing cards co-badging Russia's domestic Mir payments system with UnionPay, it added. 

Thousands of Russians, including holidaymakers, are stranded abroad after many countries closed off their airspace to Russian aircraft while Russia has retaliated with flight bans for many foreign airlines. 
The central bank advised citizens currently overseas, to withdraw cash before the ban came into force.

Investing.com - European stock markets slumped Monday, with the DAX in Germany entering a bear market, as soaring crude prices triggered concerns of a major inflationary shock for the global economy.
By 4:10 AM ET (0910 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 3.5% lower, dropping more than 20% from its peak, while the CAC 40 in France slumped 3.2% and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 fell 2.1%.
This follows comments from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said on Sunday that the Biden administration was in “very active discussions” with European governments about banning imports of Russian crude and natural gas.
Oil prices, already elevated after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine more than a week ago, climbed to levels last seen in July 2008 as the market adjusted to the potential of Russia’s supply no longer being available.
Russia is the world's top exporter of crude and oil products combined, with exports at around 7 million barrels per day, or 7% of global supply. 
By 4:10 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 6.9% higher at $123.69 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 7% to $126.32. 
Oil prices posted their largest weekly gains since mid-2020 last week, with the Brent benchmark up 21% and U.S. crude gaining 26%.
This sharp rise has raised concerns about the impact on global economic growth and inflation, particularly with many of the world’s major central banks looking to raise interest rates to cope with soaring consumer prices.
The European Central Bank meets later this week, and these surging commodity prices complicate the central bank’s policy picture.
The ECB is expected on Thursday to stick to its plans to end asset purchases under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, while doubling asset-buying under its longer running Asset Purchase Program in the second quarter.
In corporate news, Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY) stock fell more than 8% after the French lender revealed $7 billion worth of exposure to Russia and Ukraine.
On a broader look, European oil and gas stocks, as well as miners, jumped sharply on the back of the soaring commodity prices, while retailers, automakers, and banks fell sharply.
Providing a modicum of comfort, German retail sales climbed 2% on the month in January, up 10.3% on the year, while German factory orders rose 1.8% in January.

Oil's relentless climb, hitting almost $140 on Monday, means another turbulent start to the week for world markets. 
The United States and European allies are exploring banning imports of Russian oil, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday.
That sent Brent crude oil to its highest since 2008. Up some 30% since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the surge deals another shock to global price pressures already at their highest levels in decades. 
Oil at its highest since 2008 https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/movandddapa/oil0703.png 
European stock futures have dived more than 2%, U.S. equivalents are deep in the red, while in Asia, Japan's blue-chip Nikkei sank to a 15-month low and was last down around 3%.
The euro too is reeling by the fresh surge in oil prices. It hit a new 22-month low against the dollar and briefly fell below parity to the Swiss franc for the first time since January 2015 -- when Switzerland abandoned its currency peg against the euro.
The single currency appears increasingly correlated with the oil prices -- the higher oil climbs, the lower the euro descends -- as higher inflation and the blow to the economy higher energy prices threaten to squeeze consumption.
According to a note from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), a sustained $20 oil rise shock will lower real economic growth in the euro area by 0.6% and by 0.3% in the United States. 
European Central Bank policy makers meeting later this week have reason to be worried. So do other major central banks, and investors will be looking for any signs of a shift from policymakers speaking in the days ahead.

The European Central Bank meets later this week, and these surging commodity prices complicate the central bank’s policy picture.
The ECB is expected on Thursday to stick to its plans to end asset purchases under its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program, while doubling asset buying under its longer running Asset Purchase Program in the second quarter.

1658,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 01:54AM ET</span>","From Netflix to Samsung, the Exodus From Russia Becomes a Rout","(Bloomberg) -- Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), TikTok, Samsung (KS:005930) and credit card operators have joined the lengthening list of businesses cutting ties with Russia or reviewing their operations in the country as reputational and financial risks mount.
International sanctions, the closure of airspace and transports links due to the war, and the financial restrictions on SWIFT and capital controls have made it difficult if not impossible for many companies to supply parts, make payments and deliver goods to and from Russia. Added to that, the potential international consumer backlash against any company perceived as helping Vladimir Putin’s regime means that the exodus of corporations from Russia has become a stampede.
The rout reverses three decades of investment there by foreign businesses after the Soviet Union broke apart in 1991, especially in energy. Here are some of the biggest companies that have begun to unravel their connections:
Oil and Gas
Russia’s largest foreign investor, BP (NYSE:BP), led the way with its surprise announcement on Feb. 27 that it would exit its 20% stake in state-controlled Rosneft, a move that could result in a $25 billion write-off and cut the company’s global oil and gas production by a third.
Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc followed, citing Russia’s “senseless act of military aggression.” The company said it would end partnerships with state-controlled Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), including the Sakhalin-II liquefied natural gas facility and its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Germany blocked last week. Both projects are worth about $3 billion.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) said it would “discontinue” its Sakhalin-1 operations.
Equinor (NYSE:EQNR), Norway’s state-owned energy giant, said will start withdrawing from its joint ventures in Russia, worth about $1.2 billion. In parallel, Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, said it’s freezing Russian assets worth about $2.8 billion and will come up with a plan to exit by March 15.
Finance
Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) said on Saturday they are suspending operations in Russia. In separate statements that arrived within minutes of each other, Visa cited “Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,” while Mastercard referred to the “unprecedented nature of the current conflict and the uncertain economic environment.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had called on the companies to halt all business in Russia during a video call with U.S. lawmakers. Each gets about 4% of its net revenue from business linked to Russia.  American Express  (NYSE:AXP) followed on Sunday.
Some critics argue that the steps aren’t enough. While the companies said any transactions initiated with their cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country and cards issued outside of Russia won’t work at Russian merchants or ATMs, consumers inside Russia who have a locally issued card can still pay for goods and services there.
Two of the Big Four auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and KPMG LLP also said on Sunday they would cut ties with Russian businesses.
Automakers
In the space of a week, most of the world’s biggest carmakers including General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F), Volkswagen (OTC:VWAGY), and  Toyota  (NYSE:TM) announced they would halt shipments to Russia or idle plants in the country. Truckmakers Volvo (OTC:VLVLY) and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) also halted business activities there.
However, the automaker with the most to lose,  Renault  (OTC:RNLSY), has remained .
The French company’s majority control of AvtoVaz, the Soviet-era maker of Ladas, and reliance on Russia for about 12% of its revenue have unnerved investors and Renault (PA:RENA) has lost more than a third of its market value in two weeks. “Renault has promised to abide by sanctions,” Gabriel Attal, the French government spokesman, said Thursday on France Info radio.
Consumer Goods
Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), the leading smartphone seller in Russia with more than 30% of the market, suspended exports to the country of all its products. Samsung said it will donate $6 million to humanitarian efforts in the region, including $1 million in consumer electronics products.
Before the announcement, Mykhailo Fedorov, who serves as Ukraine’s vice prime minister and oversees digital operations, posted a letter on his Twitter account to Samsung vice chairman Han Jong-hee, urging the Korean tech giant to temporarily cease supplying services and products to Russia. “We need your support -- in 2022, modern technology is perhaps the best answer to the tanks, multiple rocket launchers and missiles targeting residential neighborhoods, kindergartens, and hospitals,” he wrote.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) on Friday condemned Russia’s “unjustified, unprovoked and unlawful invasion” of Ukraine and said it’s suspending all new sales of products and services in Russia. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). has halted sales of iPhones and started limiting Apple Pay services and other popular products in Russia, and removed the RT News and Sputnik News applications from App Stores outside the country. HP Inc (NYSE:HPQ), the largest supplier of PCs to Russia, has stopped exports to the country as has  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC).
 Nike  (NYSE:NKE). is one of several consumer goods companies that have cited logistical problems as a reason for suspending sales in Russia. Spanish fashion retailer  Inditex  (MC:ITX), which has has 502 stores in Russia including 86 Zara outlets, is also temporarily closing all its shops in Russia and halting online sales, saying it “cannot guarantee the continuity of operations and trading conditions.” 
Other companies have so far taken limited steps to halt business. Dairy company Danone SA’s General Secretary Laurent Sacchi said the world’s largest yogurt maker would suspend investment in Russia, but will continue to sell dairy and baby food. 
Danone Chief Executive Officer Antoine de Saint-Affrique was among CEOs and chairmen of some of France’s biggest companies who met with Emmanuel Macron on Friday, according to Le Figaro. The French president urged them not to leave Russia hastily, and in any case not without consulting the government, the newspaper reported.
Media
Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). is shutting its operations in Russia and said no new customers will be able to sign up, though it’s unclear what will happen with existing accounts.
Netflix has fewer than one million customers in Russia and has been operating in the country through a joint venture with National Media Group. The streaming giant said previously it won’t be carrying required Russian news channels on its local-language service in the country and has paused all projects and acquisitions from Russia, including four programs in production.
Hollywood studios including Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS), Paramount Pictures, Sony (T:6758), and AT&T Inc's (NYSE:T) WarnerMedia and Comcast Corp's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Universal Pictures have also halted or postponed the release of movies in Russia.
Meanwhile other platforms, including TikTok, are suspending or closing services because of Russia’s new “fake news” law aimed at silencing dissent and limiting information about the invasion of Ukraine.
“We have no choice but to suspend livestreaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law,” TikTok announced in a series of tweets. “The safety of our employees and our users remain our highest priority.”
The company, owned by China-based ByteDance Ltd., said its in-app messaging service would not be affected.
On Friday, the Russian government said it was blocking access to Meta Platform Inc.’s Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as part of the crackdown. Hours after the announcement, Meta said it would pause all advertising in the nation and would stop selling ads to Russian businesses.
Law and Accounting
Baker McKenzie said last week it was reviewing its operations in Russia and will sever ties with several Russian clients in order to comply with sanctions. The Chicago-headquartered firm’s clients include Russia’s finance ministry and VTB, Russia’s second largest bank.
London-based Linklaters said in a statement it was “reviewing all of the firm’s Russia-related work.” KPMG LLP’s U.K. chief, Jonathan Holt, said the firm will cut ties with certain clients subjected to the recent wave of sanctions against Russia.
Rising Criticism
Even as more companies sever ties with Russia, criticism is rising of banks and corporations that are perceived as profiting from the war or not doing enough to punish Putin’s invasion.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a vocal critic of Wall Street, said some banks are “undermining” sanctions by snapping up Russian corporate bonds and suggesting clients buy the nations’ assets on the cheap.
In a statement released late Friday, Warren called out market makers JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) following a Bloomberg report that the two banks had been purchasing beaten-down bonds. Banks routinely scoop up debt because clients ask them to, or because they expect to find ready buyers.
JPMorgan analysts also published a note recommending that investors boost holdings of Russian-linked debt to take advantage of a “recovery play” stemming from the sell-off that accompanied the country’s invasion of Ukraine.
“Giant Wall Street banks like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs never miss out on an opportunity to get richer even if it means capitalizing on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and undermining sanctions placed on Russian businesses,” said Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat.
Representatives for Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment on the Bloomberg report that they had been buying up Russian bonds.
Last week, McKinsey & Co.’s global managing partner Bob Sternfels took to LinkedIn to condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine and declare that the firm will no longer do business with any government entity in Russia. But the consultancy’s most senior executive in Ukraine called on companies to go further, and begin, where possible, shutting “offices and outlets” in the country, where McKinsey has operated for nearly 30 years.
The founder of Fast Retailing, which owns fashion giant Uniqlo, said the company wouldn’t be withdrawing from Russia, according to the Nikkei. “Clothes are essential items in daily life,” Tadashi Yanai, Fast Retailing’s chairman and CEO, reportedly said. “Russians have a right to live as well.”
Representatives for Fast Retailing in Tokyo didn’t immediately respond to inquiries from Bloomberg News. The company operated 50 stores in Russia, as of Feb. 28. Fast said on March 4 that it would donate $10 million and 200,000 items of clothing to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to support those fleeing Ukraine.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2022 01:35AM ET</span>",Analysis - Southeast Asian equities shine as commodities rally on Ukraine crisis,"By Alun John and Anshuman Daga
HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stocks are becoming a haven for international investors fleeing a worsening outlook for global equities who are hoping for sustained strength in the commodity-heavy economies of the region.
Driving the renewed interest is a surge in commodity prices that spells good news, particularly for key producers Indonesia and Malaysia, coupled with the sparse economic links between Southeast Asia and the warring nations of Russia and Ukraine.
Supply disruptions caused by the conflict and subsequent Western sanctions have sent commodities prices soaring, with Brent crude, coal, palm oil and nickel hitting multi-year highs.
""Commodity prices are now likely to be higher for longer,"" said Jerry Goh, an Asian equities investment manager at fund house abrdn.
""We expect Malaysia and Indonesia to continue enjoying trade surpluses, which should bolster government revenues and encourage consumer spending.""
Foreign flows into stocks in Indonesia, Southeast Asia's biggest economy, rose to $1.2 billion in February, Reuters data shows, the most since April 2019, following net outflows for much of 2019 and 2020 and only small inflows in 2021.
February's flows into Thai stocks were their highest since at least 2008 and the Philippines also saw inflows. In contrast, India and Taiwan, investor darlings in 2021, both saw outflows in February.
Indonesia is the world's top exporter of palm oil, thermal coal and a major producer of nickel, copper and refined tin, while Malaysia is the world's second largest producer and exporter of palm.
""As economic activity resumes in these two markets, this should also support a recovery in domestic earnings,"" Goh added. 
Defensive qualities in the ASEAN grouping of nations could exert themselves in the coming months, as the Russia-Ukraine conflict escalates, said Kenneth Tang, a senior portfolio manager for Asian equities at Nikko Asset Management. 
MSCI's broadest index of world shares has fallen 11% year-to-date, but Indonesia, with year-to-date gains of nearly 5%, is the best performing Asian market after the Jakarta Composite Index hit a record last week. 
Coal producers Adaro Energy and Bayan Resources have soared to record highs.
Stocks in neighbouring Malaysia hit a 10-month high last week, after February's jump of 6.3%.
Thus Indonesia and Malaysia offer a ""perfect stagflation hedge"" as the the only two net commodity exporters in Asia ex-Japan,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) economists said.
Abrdn says it fancies sectors exposed to commodity markets, but also highlighted that low-cost Southeast Asia was well placed to draw more foreign direct investment in building supply chains in areas such as electric vehicles and energy storage.
The strong performance in Indonesian markets could bode well for equity listings, as its biggest tech firm, GoTo, looks to launch a domestic IPO that could raise at least $1 billion in the first half, sources have said.
Last year, Indonesian fundraising via IPOs rose to its highest in a decade, fuelled by investor interest in tech firms.
""SELL WHAT YOU OWN""
The foreign flows into Southeast Asian stocks are a sharp change from previous years, when the COVID-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on lives and economic growth in many countries in the region.
Economic prospects are brightening.
Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, booked a budget surplus of $2 billion in January as tax revenues soared.
That has driven a shift in perception that Malaysia and Indonesia are vulnerable during periods of Fed policy tightening, such as now, thanks to a large foreign presence in their bond markets.
Foreign ownership accounted for 28% of Indonesian stocks in January, down from 37% in March 2013, according to Nomura. Non-residents now hold only a quarter of Malaysian government debt. They hold less than a fifth of Indonesian government debt, down from 39% at the end of 2019.

""There's an adage, 'You sell what you own', and what foreign investors own at the moment in Asia is India, Taiwan, and a little bit of Korea,"" said Chetan Seth, an Asia-Pacific equity strategist at Nomura. 
""They don't own much Southeast Asia, so how much can they sell?""

(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil and gas producers  Oasis Petroleum  (NASDAQ:OAS) Inc and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) Corp are close to agreeing an all-stock merger that could be announced as soon as this week, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
The combined value of the two companies would be around $6.07 billion, according to Reuters calculations based upon Friday's closing prices, which valued Oasis at $2.80 billion and Whiting at $3.27 billion.
The person with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private information.
The deal talks between the pair, which both operate in the Bakken shale formation of North Dakota, come amid a significant spike in crude oil prices on the back of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Both Brent and U.S. benchmarks temporarily hit their highest levels since 2008 as trading began the week in Asia, as the United States and European allies mulled a Russian oil import ban in response to the conflict, which Russia calls a ""special operation"". [O/R]
The Wall Street Journal had earlier reported the talks between Oasis and Whiting. 
Oasis Petroleum and Whiting Petroleum did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Both companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020 after the energy industry reeled under an unprecedented crash in oil prices due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with Whiting the first publicly traded shale producer to file for bankruptcy when it did so in April of that year. 
Last year, oil and gas pipeline operator Crestwood Equity (NYSE:CEQP) Partners LP said it would buy Oasis Petroleum's midstream unit in a $1.8 billion deal.

Asset managers Nordea, Royal London and several large European and U.S. pension funds are among those pushing for Amazon to issue a transparency report in line with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) tax standard, the newspaper said.
They want to bring a shareholders' resolution demanding the new standard at the company's annual meeting this year, it said, citing a letter to be sent this week to the U.S. regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission.
""Aggressive tax practices can expose a company and its investors to increased scrutiny from tax authorities, adjustment risks, and increase their vulnerability to changes in tax rules,"" the investors said.
These measures come at a time when nations are looking to protect their tax bases from deleterious practices, they added in the letter seen by the FT.
The 100 groups that signed the letter included several environmental, social and governance-focused and religious funds, although not all were investors, the paper said. 
An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on the resolution, but pointed to last month's no-action request when the company barred a similar shareholder proposal.
""The proposal implicates exactly the type of ordinary business issues for which resolution should remain with the company’s management and board,"" Amazon said.
It would be impractical for shareholders to exercise direct oversight of such issues, it added.

Amazon's current extensive tax disclosures are in line with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), it said, adding that it has publicly reported tax payments in the United States, Britain, France, Italy and Spain.
A December shareholder proposal by the Greater Manchester Pension Fund and Oblate International Pastoral Investment Trust urged Amazon to adopt the new GRI tax standard, and make public breakdowns of financial, tax and worker information by country.

Investing.com – Asia Pacific stocks were down on Monday morning, alongside U.S. equity futures. The conflict in Ukraine could last longer than expected after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the war in Ukraine would continue. Investors are also concerned about an inflation shock in the global economy, with oil soaring over a potential ban on Russian crude supplies.
China’s Shanghai Composite fell 1% by 9:38 PM ET (2:38 AM GMT) and the Shenzhen Component fell 1.92%. February’s trade data, including exports, imports, and the trade balance, is due later in the day. More data, including the consumer and producer price indexes, is due on Wednesday.
China also set its 2022 GDP target at an ambitious “about 5.5%” on Saturday. The country also signaled that more stimulus measures could be on the way, with Premier Li Keqiang vowing at the opening of the National People’s Congress (NPC) to take bold steps to protect the economy as risks mount. Foreign Minister Wang Yi will deliver his briefing to the NPC on Monday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 3.31%.
Japan’s Nikkei 225 225 fell 3.29% and South Korea’s KOSPI fell 2.35%. In Australia, the ASX 200 fell 1.31%.
The West is exploring a coordinated embargo on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine while ensuring appropriate global supply, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday.
In response, Putin signed a decree allowing the government and companies to pay foreign creditors in rubles, and the Ministry of Finance warned that sanctions will determine if international investors are able to collect payments. More businesses are also starting to pull out of their operations in Russia, including Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). and TikTok.
The invasion has already led to surging prices in grains, metals, and energy, with oil hitting the $139 mark, due to concerns of supply disruptions. This, alongside high inflation, is adding to worries about the global economic recovery from COVID-19.
The U.S. Federal Reserve and other key central banks will now have to juggle tightening monetary policy to curb inflation without impacting economic growth and risky assets.
“For the U.S. economy, we now see stagflation, with persistently higher inflation and less economic growth than expected before the war,” Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni said in a note.
“For stock investors, we think 2022 will continue to be one of this bull market’s toughest years.”
The Fed should increase interest rates to close to its “neutral” setting this year, implying as many as seven quarter-point hikes, Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said on Friday. Markets are pricing in around five interest rates of that size in 2022.
“Central banks are facing an exogenous stagflationary shock they cannot do much about,” Federated Hermes senior economist Silvia Dall’Angelo said in a note.
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe will speak on Wednesday and Friday, while the European Central Bank hands down its policy decision on Thursday.
On the data front, the U.S. releases its consumer price index on Thursday."
1663,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2022 06:01PM ET</span>",'The shops are gone': How Reliance stunned Amazon in battle for India's Future Retail,"By Aditya Kalra and Abhirup Roy
MUMBAI (Reuters) -At a large Future Retail supermarket in Mumbai last week, workers were unloading hundreds of bright blue grocery crates belonging to India's biggest retailer Reliance.
Prospective customers were turned back by security, disappointed at the closed state of the store that still carries the signage of Future's biggest brand, Big Bazaar, but which will likely soon be rebranded as a Reliance outlet.
Across India, similar scenes are being played out as Reliance Industries, India's biggest conglomerate run by Mukesh Ambani, the country's richest man, presses ahead with a shock de facto takeover of prized retail real estate that Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been keen to take part-ownership of.
The high-profile bitter dispute between corporate titans in which Amazon has sought to block Reliance's planned $3.4 billion purchase of Future Group's retail assets is currently before India's Supreme Court.
Reliance's takeover began with utmost stealth on the night of Feb. 25 when its staff began arriving at Future stores. Many in Future's management were in the dark about the plans as store employees from all over the country frantically began to call, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
""It was tense, everybody was panicking. We didn't know who they were. They wanted access and seniors didn't know about it,"" a New Delhi Big Bazaar store employee said, describing what happened around 8 p.m. that day.
At a Future store in Sonipat town in northern Haryana state, announcements were made asking customers to leave as Reliance seized control, one source said. In Vadodara in western Gujarat, Future employees arriving for work the next morning were asked to go back home with no explanation, said another source.
Citing unpaid payments by Future, Reliance has taken control of operations of some 200 Big Bazaar stores and has plans to seize another 250 of Future's retail outlets. Combined, they represent the crown jewels of Future's retail network and around a third of all Future outlets.
Although Reliance had not played a large public role in the legal dispute, it had, according to sources, for some months assumed many of the leases held by cash-strapped Future, India's No. 2 retailer and Amazon's estranged business partner.
Reliance's sudden possession of the stores appears to have landed what some analysts are calling a coup de grace that spoils Amazon's chances of untangling the transfer of Future's assets to Reliance. That's despite a series of legal battles won by the U.S. e-commerce giant to date blocking the 2020 deal announced between the two Indian companies. 
""What will Amazon fight for now?"" said a source close to the U.S. company with knowledge of the legal dispute. ""The shops are gone.""
Representatives for Reliance, Amazon and Future did not respond to Reuters queries for this article. Sources asked not to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the dispute.
AFTER THE TAKEOVER, TALKS
Future Retail said on Feb. 26 it was ""scaling down its operations"" to cut losses although it made no mention of Reliance in its statement. Future Group as a whole has more than $4 billion in debt.
Reliance plans to retain Future's employees at the stores it takes over, sources have said.
Amazon, which has a stake in a separate Future Group unit that it argues prevents Future from selling retail assets without its permission, has called the supermarkets and other stores an ""irreplaceable"" network in a sector worth $900 billion in revenues annually.
The legal wrangles had over time become increasingly high-stakes and marked by ugly rhetoric. At one point, Amazon sought for Future Chief Executive Kishore Biyani to be detained in prison for disobeying a legal order. And Future once likened Amazon to Alexander the Great and his ""ruthless ambition to scorch the earth"". 
But on Thursday, six days after Reliance's move, Amazon at a Supreme Court hearing unexpectedly called for cordial talks to end the dispute - a proposal Future agreed to.
""People have taken over shops ... let's at least have a conversation,"" Amazon's lawyer Gopal Subramanium said. 
Discussions are expected to begin soon. 
Whatever the outcome of the talks, analysts say Amazon had gravely underestimated Reliance.

""If anybody should have seen this coming, it should have been Amazon and they should have prepared against it,"" said Devangshu Dutta of retail consultancy Third Eyesight. 
""Clearly, they didn't.""

In a ""Survey Monkey"" poll seen by Reuters, the Wall Street bank asks investors to vote on their ""expectations"" over whether various sovereign and corporate hard-currency and rouble-denominated bonds and securities should be retained or removed.
Those expecting the securities to be removed are asked about their preferred timing - at the end of March or the end of April. The poll requests answers to be submitted no later than midnight on Sunday.
JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the survey. 
Western countries have imposed a sweeping range of sanctions on Russia's government, as well as many banks, companies and individuals in a push to isolate Moscow following the invasion of neighbouring Ukraine launched on Feb. 24.
Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists.
JPMorgan runs the widely followed family of sovereign hard-currency indexes EMBI, as well as a corporate debt counterpart CEMBI. It also has the GBI-EM benchmark for local debt in emerging currencies and the JESG index governed by environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors.
According to the bank's own information, assets worth $842 billion are benchmarked against those indexes. Russia has a weighting of 0.89% in the bank's EMBIG Diversified index, and an even larger 1.03% weighting in the ESG version of the index. 

JPMorgan placed Russia on index watch on March 1 after sanctions were imposed on the country.
Debt from Russian ally Belarus is also under review by JPMorgan for removal from its ESG index suite. The country has faced condemnation over violent crackdowns by authorities around the disputed 2020 election and the subsequent skyjacking of an opposition journalist.

Chitra Ramkrishna was arrested in New Delhi, the source at the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said, without sharing further details.
The market regulator penalised Ramkrishna, among others, after an investigation that showed she had sought advice for years from an outsider she described as a Himalayan yogi. 

The action is the latest sign the CBI is stepping up its investigation of a 2018 case involving allegations that the NSE provided some high frequency traders unfair access to speed up algorithmic trading. The additional scrutiny risks further delaying a planned NSE listing.
Sunday's arrest follows a Feb. 11 order by the market regulator that highlighted lapses at the exchange and said Ramkrishna, who quit as CEO in 2016, was ""merely a puppet"" of someone she described as a yogi.

(Reuters) -U.S. payments firms  Visa Inc  (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) on Saturday said they were suspending operations in Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, and that they would work with clients and partners to cease all transactions there.
Within days, all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside of the country and any Visa cards issued outside of Russia will no longer work within the country, the company said.
""We are compelled to act following Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed,"" Al Kelly, chief executive officer of Visa, said in a statement.
U.S. President Joe Biden, in a call with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, welcomed Visa's and Mastercard's decisions to suspend their operations in Russia, the White House said. [W1N2QI054]
""President Biden noted his administration is surging security, humanitarian, and economic assistance to Ukraine and is working closely with Congress to secure additional funding,"" a White House readout of the call added.
The move by the payments firms could mean more disruption for Russians who are bracing for an uncertain future of spiraling inflation, economic hardship and an even sharper squeeze on imported goods.
Unprecedented Western sanctions imposed on Russia have frozen much of the country's central bank's $640 billion in assets; barred several banks from global payments system SWIFT; and sent the rouble into free-fall, erasing a third of its value this week.
On Monday, Ukraine's central bank chief Kyrylo Shevchenko told Nikkei Asia https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Ukraine-urges-Visa-and-MasterCard-to-halt-Russian-cards2 the central bank and Zelenskiy urged Visa and MasterCard to halt transactions of their credit and debit cards issued by Russian banks to increase pressure on the Russian regime, the paper.
A growing number of financial and technology companies have suspended Russian operations.  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL), announced its decision earlier on Saturday.
ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM 
Sberbank Rossii PAO, Russia's largest lender, said the moves by Visa and Mastercard would not affect users of the cards it issues in Russia, Tass news reported.
Sberbank said its customers would be able to withdraw cash, make transfers, pay both in offline stores and Russian internet stores because transactions in Russia pass through the domestic National Payment Card System which does not depend on foreign payment systems, according to Tass.
Russia has been taking steps to increase the independence of its financial system for years, particularly after ties with the West deteriorated over the country's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
The country set up its own banking messaging system, known as SPFS, as an alternative to SWIFT and its own card payment system MIR began operating in 2015. They were part of Moscow's efforts to develop homegrown financial tools to mirror Western ones, to protect the country in case sanctions are broadened.
Mastercard and Visa had significant business in Russia. In 2021, about 4% of Mastercard's net revenues were derived from business conducted within, into and out of Russia. Meanwhile, business conducted within, into and out of Ukraine accounted for 2% of its net revenues, according to a filing on Tuesday.
Visa also reported that total net revenue from Russia in 2021 was about 4% of its total.
Mastercard, which has operated in Russia for 25 years, said its cards issued by Russian banks will no longer be supported by Mastercard networks, and that any the company's card issued outside of the Russia will not work at Russian merchants or ATMs.

Mastercard said it decided to suspend its network services in Russia following its recent action to block multiple Russian financial institutions from the company's payment network, as required by regulators globally.
Visa also said this week it blocked multiple Russian financial institutions from its network in compliance with government sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2022 09:35PM ET</span>",Brazil government appoints Rodolfo Landim to chair Petrobras board,"By Sabrina Valle
HOUSTON (Reuters) -Brazil's government has appointed former Petrobras executive Rodolfo Landim to chair the state-controlled oil producer's board, the company said in a filing on Saturday night.
Earlier in the day, Admiral Eduardo Bacellar Leal Ferreira told Reuters he planned to step down as chairman of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the Rio de Janeiro firm is formally known.
""Petrobras chairman is a 24-hour job and I want to spend more time with my family,"" Ferreira said, adding he has two grown children living outside of Brazil.
Ferreira will stay until the end of his term. A shareholder meeting to renew the company's board is scheduled for April 13.
The replacement comes as Petrobras faces pressure from investors to raise fuel prices as oil approached $120 per barrel. The company controls gasoline and diesel prices in Brazil with more than 80% of the country's refining capacity.
Ferreira declined to comment on Petrobras' fuel price policy. 
Rodolfo Landim made a career at Petrobras before creating his own oil company, Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas, and selling it to investors in 2020.
He first joined Petrobras in 1980 and worked for 26 years at the company, rising to head of the natural gas division. In 2003, during the first presidential term of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Landim was appointed by the government as chief executive of Petrobras's gas station chain subsidiary, the largest fuel retailer company in Latin America. He ran the fuel company until 2006.
Landim currently runs a soccer team in Brazil as its president.
His confirmation as chairman is expected as the government controls the board with a majority of the voting shares.
If confirmed, Landim will rejoin Petrobras with a challenge of balancing a fuel price policy that pleases both investors and the government ahead of presidential elections in October.
On Thursday, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said Petrobras could lower its profit to prevent fuel prices from surging.
In a weekly social media address, Bolsonaro said he was certain Petrobras would do what is necessary to shield consumers from suffering steep price increases.
Bolsonaro's comments come after Petrobras in 2021 smashed its all-time record for annual profit and dividend payouts, thanks to sky-high Brent prices. The remarks could raise fears among investors that he could seek to feature in the company's price-setting policies. 
Petrobras' policy of seeking parity between domestic fuel prices and international markets has angered many Brazilians as the cost of Brent crude has soared. A growing chorus of politicians has said Petrobras should help shoulder the burden.

On Wednesday, Chief Executive Joaquim Silva e Luna told Reuters that Petrobras had not yet taken a decision on fuel price adjustments.
The government also appointed another seven names to the board. Those are Petrobras Chief Executive Joaquim Silva e Luna, who will have his term at the board renewed, Carlos Eduardo Lessa Brandão, Luiz Henrique Caroli, Márcio Andrade Weber, Murilo Marroquim de Souza, Ruy Flaks Schneider and Sonia Julia Sulzbeck Villalobos.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2022 03:25PM ET</span>","Analysis-As Russia avoids energy sanctions, oil majors flee but TotalEnergies stays","By Shadia Nasralla, Benjamin Mallet and Michel Rose
LONDON (Reuters) - France's TotalEnergies cuts a lonely figure hanging onto its Russian investments during a mass exodus of western oil majors from the country after its invasion of Ukraine, even though no sanctions have forced such divestments.
""For existing assets, the company says it will respect European sanctions whatever the consequences. But for the moment, there are no sanctions on energy,"" said a source familiar with the thinking inside TotalEnergies. 
TotalEnergies has a future-oriented position in Russia, heavily weighted towards liquefied natural gas (LNG), with stakes in the yet-to-be built $21 billion Arctic LNG 2 project as well as in the producing Yamal LNG operation.
With the world trying to slash carbon emissions, oil majors are betting on LNG to replace more-polluting coal and oil. TotalEnergies first bought a stake in Russian gas producer Novatek in 2011 for $4 billion and gradually increased its stake to just under 20% by 2018.
""The company cannot divest assets from one day to the next unless sanctions force it to do so. One must take time to reflect,"" said the source.
The French government has declined to comment on specific companies and Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron, who convened members of a Franco-Russian forum on Tuesday, did not urge TotalEnergies or French companies to leave Russia, two participants told Reuters. Among those present was TotalEnergies Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne.
In contrast, Britain's government immediately applauded Shell (LON:RDSa)'s and BP (NYSE:BP)'s decision to exit Russia. Chief Executive Officer Bernard Looney told employees BP ""couldn't reasonably carry on in Russia given the conflict in Ukraine,"" according to a company source.
Billions of dollars of impending write-downs are piling up for the companies that have said they would exit their Russian assets: BP, Shell, Equinor and  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM). For now, there are few potential buyers for the stakes and operations they are leaving in Russia.
Share prices of the companies that have exited Russia have outperformed TotalEnergies in recent days. 
Graphic - TotalEnergies shares underperforming peers: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xmpjoebwlvr/Pasted%20image%201646312060659.png
""We see a potential exit by TTE being much more complicated than it is for peers,"" said RBC equity analyst Biraj Borkhataria
on Wednesday. ""We see Russia as strategically important for TTE, particularly for its LNG business."" 
TotalEnergies aims to satisfy 10% of global LNG markets by 2025 with 50 million tonnes a year. Russia accounts for 6 million tonnes from Yamal and another 4 million tonnes from Arctic LNG 2 once operational, according to RBC.
Reuters could not verify total returns on investments in Russia by the oil majors, which do not regularly publish asset and country-specific financials. Still, it was clear that BP, for example, has already made good on its investments.
When former U.S. President Donald Trump hit Iran with sanctions, TotalEnergies also stuck with its investment in a big gas field, dropping it only after failing to obtain a sanctions waiver from Washington in 2018.
At the time, media reported that Pouyanne told Trump that continued investment could help democratic progress in Iran. 
In 2021, TotalEnergies' cashflow from Russia amounted to $1.5 billion. It declined to give further details on its Russian investments and previous years' cashflows.
Meanwhile, BP faces a write-down of up to $25 billion for dropping Russia and losing out on annual dividends from Rosneft which have fluctuated between around $300 million and $780 million, according to its quarterly results.
But the cashflow it has received from Russia over the years might soothe some of that pain. 
In 2003, BP and Russian investors created TNK-BP in which BP invested $8 billion. In the 10 years that followed, BP received around $19 billion in dividends.
In 2013, Rosneft bought BP's stake in TNK-BP for around $12 billion in cash and Rosneft shares that have yielded dividends for BP of over $4 billion.
Shell, which was an early partner in Russia's first LNG plant, Sakhalin II, sold half of its 55% stake to Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) in 2007 for $4.1 billion, two years before the project came online.
Its 2021 net earnings from Sakhalin II and its Salym oilfields, which started full production in 2006, were $700 million, it said. Tax reports showed accumulated earnings from Russia were around $384 million in 2020, $455 million in 2019 and a loss of $16 million in 2018. 
Flagging impairments from its Russian exit, Shell said it had around $3 billion in non-current assets. A Shell spokesperson declined to give further details.
As for Exxon Mobil shutting the door on its $4 billion in assets in Russia and triggering what could become a write-down, it has benefited from operating large offshore oil and gas fields near Sakhalin Island since 2005.
Exxon did not break down its investments in Russia and declined to comment on a potential writedown. But Chief Financial Officer Kathryn Mikells said on Wednesday that leaving its Russian oil and gas operations would shave 1%-2% from earnings.

""All of them will struggle to repatriate future income from Russia. A difference between them is that TotalEnergies’ can argue they have less direct ties the government because Novatek is privately-owned. The question is how long that argument can hold,"" said Giacomo Romeo, Jefferies equities analyst.
""In terms of investment recoverability, direct stakes in LNG assets such as Sakhalin, Yamal and Arctic LNG are different from stakes in companies such as Rosneft and Novatek. Chinese or Indian investors might be interested in stakes in LNG assets, if the price is low enough and there are enough uncontracted volumes.""

Tass said the Russian transport ministry had drawn up a draft bill to help airlines until September 2022. It would also suspend all planned and unscheduled inspections of carriers, the Russian news agency reported.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) - the world's two largest aircraft manufacturers - have suspended the supply of components and services to Russian airlines, a move that will likely make it harder to maintain planes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Oil major Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) will put profits from any Russian oil it purchases into a fund that will go towards humanitarian aid to Ukraine, the company said on Saturday.
Shell had on Friday bought a cargo of Russian crude oil at a record low discount, the first such trade since Russia invaded Ukraine last week.
The deal, which did not violate Western sanctions on Moscow, was criticized by Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba.
""I am told Shell discreetly bought some Russian oil yesterday. One question to @Shell: doesn't Russian oil smell (of) Ukrainian blood for you?,"" Kuleba wrote in a tweet.
In a statement published shortly afterwards, Shell defended the purchase and said it would choose alternatives to Russian oil wherever possible, but this could not happen overnight because of how significant Russia is to global supply.
It added: ""We didn't take this decision lightly and we understand the strength of feeling around it.""

Shell said it would give any profits from the limited amount of Russian oil it has to purchase to a dedicated fund, and together with aid agencies would determine where those funds would best be used to help alleviate hardship suffered by the people of Ukraine.
Russian exporters have in recent days faced severe problems with credit lines, shipping and insurance, resulting in delays and cancellations to their attempts to find buyers for Russian crude.

(Reuters) - ZTE Corp (HK:0763)., the Chinese telecom equipment maker, will go back to U.S. federal court March 14 to face a new accusation it may have violated its probation from its 2017 guilty plea for illegally shipping U.S. technology to Iran.
The possible violation relates to an alleged conspiracy to commit visa fraud, according to a March 4 court filing in a Texas federal court. 
An indictment unsealed last March charges a former ZTE research director in New Jersey and a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology with conspiring to bring Chinese nationals to the U.S. with J-1 visas, which are designed for work and study at institutions like Georgia Tech. After arriving the Chinese nationals went to work for ZTE in New Jersey, the indictment alleges.The professor, Gee-Kung Chang, has pleaded not guilty. The status of the ZTE research director, Jianjun Yu, is unclear. ZTE is not charged in the case.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Georgia, where the visa case is pending, declined to comment.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A lawyer for ZTE also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
If ZTE is found to have violated its probation, the ramifications are unclear. But in the past ZTE has faced massive fines and other penalties for running afoul of U.S. authorities.
ZTE agreed to pay $892 million and pleaded guilty in Texas in 2017 to criminal charges for violating U.S. laws that restrict the sale of American-made technology to Iran and North Korea. 
A five-year investigation had found ZTE conspired to evade U.S. embargoes by buying U.S. components, incorporating them into ZTE equipment and illegally shipping them to Iran. Investigators also uncovered 283 shipments of telecommunications equipment to North Korea. 
At the time, ZTE agreed to three years of probation, a compliance program, and a corporate monitor. 
But in 2018, the U.S. Commerce Department said ZTE lied about disciplining executives tied to the wrongdoing and banned ZTE from doing business with U.S. suppliers. 

ZTE paid $1 billion and agreed to change its leadership and cooperate with a second 10-year monitor, among other terms, to get the ban lifted.
The Texas judge also extended the company's probation from the criminal case and the monitor for another two years, until March 22, 2022.

Many western funds and companies have said they would leave Russia following the invasion, which Moscow terms a ""special military action,"" including BP (NYSE:BP), Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. On Friday the London Stock Exchange suspended trading in Russian securities.
Financial firms like banks can face obstacles to departure. Vanguard said ""Some Russian securities may not be traded because of sanctions restrictions,"" and that Russian Central Bank actions have effectively shut off its securities market to foreign investors.

So far the effects on Vanguard funds have been limited, Vanguard said.
Of U.S.-domiciled Vanguard funds, index funds account for about 80% of the exposure to Russia and Ukraine. Funds invested in Russia and or Ukraine had about 1% of assets there, on average. Russian stocks and bonds made up ""most of the modest exposure,"" Vanguard said.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2022 06:20AM ET</span>",Zara owner Inditex closes Russian stores and online platform,"MADRID (Reuters) -Spanish fashion retailer  Inditex  (MC:ITX) has halted trading in Russia, closing its 502 shops and stopping online sales, the company said in a statement on Saturday. 
The Zara owner is following some of the biggest western brands which have suspended operations in Russia, including its main rival H&M, following the invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of economic sanctions.
""In the current circumstances Inditex cannot guarantee the continuity of the operations and commercial conditions in the Russian Federation and temporarily suspends its activity"", the world's biggest fashion company said.
Russia accounts for around 8.5% of the group's global EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) and all the Inditex stores operate on a rental basis, Inditex said. ""The investment is not relevant from a financial point of view"".
Inditex said it would give its workforce of more than 9,000 people a special support plan, without giving any details. The group had said its 79 stores in Ukraine have already been temporarily closed.
Spain's second-largest fashion retailer Mango said on Thursday it was temporarily closing its 120 Russian shops, and Tendam, the third-largest clothing group, said it had taken a similar decision on Saturday. 

""The combination of the weakness in the rouble resulting in large price increases for the Russian consumer and increased logistical difficulties will make operations difficult for all retailers importing into Russia, even if there are no direct sanctions on their product categories,"" Adam Cochrane, analyst at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) Research, said.
""Russia was an important element of the sales growth in 2021 for Inditex,"" Cochrane added.

(Reuters) - Payments company  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL) shut down its services early on Saturday in Russia, citing ""the current circumstances,"" joining many financial and tech companies in suspending operations there after the invasion of Ukraine.
""Under the current circumstances, we are suspending PayPal services in Russia,"" President and Chief Executive Dan Schulman said in a statement. He added that the company ""stands with the international community in condemning Russia's violent military aggression in Ukraine.""
A company spokesperson said PayPal will support withdrawals ""for a period of time, ensuring that account balances are dispersed in line with applicable laws and regulations.”
PayPal, which had only allowed cross-border transactions by users in Russia, stopped accepting new users in the country on Wednesday.
Ukrainian government officials had been calling on PayPal to quit Russia and help them with fundraising.

PayPal said on Friday that ""since the beginning of the invasion, PayPal has helped raise over $150 million for charities supporting response efforts in Ukraine, one of the largest efforts we've seen in such a short period of time.” 
PayPal's suspension in Russia also applies to its money transfer tool Xoom. Rivals Wise and Remitly earlier suspended some services in Russia.

POTSDAM, Germany (Reuters) -Tesla Inc received a conditional go-ahead for its German gigafactory near Berlin on Friday, the state of Brandenburg said, ending months of delay for the 5 billion euro ($5.5 billion) landmark plant.
The gigafactory, which is crucial to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk's ambitions to vanquish European market leader Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), was initially supposed to open last summer. 
Germany's largest automaker has the upper hand in Europe, with a 25% share of electric vehicle (EV) sales to Tesla's 13%.
Brandenburg state premier Dietmar Woidke told a news briefing that the development marked ""a big step into the future"", adding that the Tesla plant would be a major industrial and technological driver for Germany and the region.
Around 2,600 of the plant's expected 12,000 workers have been hired so far, unions said last month, and Tesla is in talks with numerous parts suppliers in the region to source as much as possible locally, lowering waiting times and costs.
Underlining the intense competition facing Tesla, Volkswagen said on Friday it would spend about 2 billion euros on a new factory near its Wolfsburg headquarters to make the Trinity, the first of a new generation of electric vehicles for the German carmaker, with construction due to start next year.
Friday's 536-page conditional building permit for Tesla does not mean the U.S.-based EV pioneer can start production right away. It must first prove that it fulfils numerous conditions, including in water use and air pollution control.
Only then will Tesla get its long-awaited operating permit and actually start rolling out the 500,000 battery-powered vehicles it wants to produce each year at the new plant, located in the small community of Gruenheide.
Another hurdle to secure the site's water supply emerged late on Friday, when a Frankfurt Oder administrative court sided with environmental groups who had challenged a licence given to a local water utility to supply the Tesla site. 
But the court said the procedural errors made in the licencing decision could be remedied by the water utility, leaving open the door for the water supply arrangement to be salvaged. 
Kickstarting production in Germany would mean Tesla can deliver its Model Y cars to European customers faster and more cheaply, after meeting orders in Europe from its Shanghai factory in recent months as it awaited approval for the site.
Tesla plans to show that it meets the imposed conditions within the next two weeks, Brandenburg's environment minister Axel Vogel said, while objections can be filed over the next month.
Tesla's next challenge will be to scale up production as quickly as possible, which Musk said at a fair on-site in October would take longer than building the factory.
Local environmental groups have long feared that the plant will negatively impact local habitat. Numerous public consultations, focusing primarily on that aspect, delayed the process, with Musk expressing irritation on multiple occasions over German bureaucracy.
The factory, which Tesla has begun constructing under pre-approval permits, will also include a battery plant capable of generating more than 50 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year - outstripping European competitors.

Batteries for cars produced on-site will initially come from China, Musk said, but he intends to reach volume production at the German battery plant by the end of next year.

1692,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 10:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive-Boeing aims to nearly double 737 MAX production by end-2023 -sources,"By Eric M. Johnson and Tim Hepher
SEATTLE/PARIS (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co has preliminary plans to boost production of its cash cow 737-family narrowbody to around 47 per month by the end of next year, as the U.S. planemaker looks to extend its recovery from successive crises, two people familiar with the matter said.
After slashing production due mainly to the pandemic, Boeing and European rival Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) are seeing more demand for their medium-haul passenger jets, with both planemakers adding eye-catching deals to their order books in recent weeks.
Boeing's production plans shift and are influenced by many factors, the people cautioned. Doubts are already swirling in the industry over whether the supply chain will be able to meet aggressive production ramp-up plans, particularly in Europe. Suppliers are grappling with labor and materials shortages and weakened balance sheets following the overlapping pandemic and 737 MAX safety grounding crises.
Boeing said in late January it was working to clear an inventory of 335 737 MAX airplanes amassed following two fatal crashes of the jet that grounded the plane for 20 months. It has estimated most of those jets would be delivered by the end of 2023.
Boeing declined to comment on its production plans and referred to its last public statements. 
In late January, Chief Financial Officer Brian West said the 737 program was producing at a rate of 27 jets per month and was on track to reach 31 per month ""fairly soon"". 
Two of the people said the 31-jet monthly stride would come during the second half of the year, though a third person said it could happen sooner.
Beyond that, Boeing aims to increase to around 38 narrowbody jets monthly during the first half of 2023, and reach about 47 jets per month in the second half of 2023, two people said.
Boeing was laying the groundwork to nearly double production by the end of 2023, the third person said, but noted the plans could change due to supply chain constraints or other factors.
A rate of 47 aircraft per month is five shy of its build rate in 2019, when the 737 MAX was grounded.

Airbus, meanwhile, has set a production target of 65 a month by summer 2023 for its A320-family narrowbody.
It has been at odds with engine makers led by France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) over its ambitions to push production afterwards as high as 75 a month.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 09:46PM ET</span>",Russia-Ukraine turmoil triggers market stress alarms,"By Dhara Ranasinghe, Yoruk Bahceli and Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) -Financial indicators signalled increasing signs of stresses spreading through global markets on Friday as concerns grow over the wider economic fallout of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
With stock market prices and bond yields falling, gauges regarded as stress indicators are attracting investor attention. 
The so-called FRA-OIS spread, which measures the gap between the U.S three-month forward rate agreement and the overnight index swap rate, hit its highest level since May 2020.
A higher spread reflects rising interbank lending risk or banks hoarding U.S. dollars, meaning that it is widely viewed as a proxy for banking sector risk.
The U.S. FRA-OIS spread rose to 32.29 basis points on Friday, compared with 23.7 on Thursday.
Global alarm was triggered earlier by a blaze at the site of a Ukrainian nuclear power station, Europe's biggest, after it was seized by Russian forces. The fire has been extinguished.
""The market's liquidity conditions have weakened this week, and were exacerbated overnight after reports of shelling to Europe's largest nuclear plant in Ukraine,"" said ING currency strategist Francesco Pesole. 
Nevertheless, the FRA-OIS gap remains well below levels seen at the height of market turmoil in 2020. 
""Dollar funding conditions are not too alarming at the moment, but the deterioration in the past week naturally argues in favour of a stronger dollar,"" Pesole added.
The dollar index jumped nearly 1%, mainly at the expense of the euro which has tumbled 3% this week because of Europe's exposure to the Russian economy.
Another closely-watched short-term funding stress gauge, the spread between the U.S. three-month Libor and the overnight index swap rate, rose to more than 18 basis points , its highest since May 2020, as well. 
The LIBOR-OIS spread is the credit and term premium a lender would charge for a three-month unsecured loan over an overnight bank loan, such as the effective fed funds rate, the risk-free rate set by the Federal Reserve. 
""Our sense is that this week's unsecured funding pressure reflects a precautionary build up of cash balances that is to some extent exacerbated by the upcoming Fed hike,"" wrote Joseph Abate, managing director, at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in a research note.
""Although Libor has lost much of its significance since year-end and the end of banks' ability to put on new trades, the rate is still seen as an early warning barometer of financial market stress,"" he added.
DOLLAR SWAPS MARKET, OTHER STRESS METRICS
The demand for dollars was reflected in swap markets where dollar borrowing costs rose further. For instance, three-month euro-dollar swaps rose to around 27 bps from 15 bps on Thursday. 
However, swap rates remained below a March 2020 peak of nearly 40 bps hit on Monday, and analysts said the Federal Reserve and other major central banks have mechanisms to relieve funding stress. 
Stress metrics are on the rise elsewhere too. 
The cost of insuring exposure to a basket of ""junk-rated"" European company debt jumped to its highest since July 2020 at 398 bps, the iTraxx European Crossover index showed.
Another iTraxx index which measures the cost of insuring exposure to senior bonds from banks and other financial issuers rose 7 bps to 91.7 bps, a May 2020 high.
A European banking stocks index is down 16% this week, reeling from Western sanctions on Russia, a scaling back of interest rate hike forecasts and a worsening macroeconomic environment. 
Also in focus was the daily number of repo fails, which occur when a market participant is unable to deliver the security on time to complete a repo transaction. 

Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said daily repo fails of Treasuries rose to $76.1 billion on Feb. 28, the highest since June 2020 and more than double the average for this year.
While repo fails are relatively common, large nubers of failures in volatile markets suggest dislocations and stress.

1694,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 08:55PM ET</span>",Honduran minister says new mining restrictions not retroactive,"By Gustavo Palencia
TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The Honduran government's recent push to sharply restrict mining will not apply to existing projects, the country's environment and mining minister said on Friday, days after the ministry declared the industry harmful and pledged to cancel permits.
The government announced on Monday that permit cancellations, as well as a sweeping prohibition on open-pit mining, were needed due to harm the extractive sector poses to natural resources, public health and water access.
At a news conference in the capital Tegucigalpa, a reporter asked environment and mining Minister Lucky Medina if the government will stick to its declaration that Honduras be free from open pit mining.
""The measure never had a retroactive effect to strip those who have already obtained their licenses, nor strip them of their previous (licenses),"" responded Medina.
""That's an evidently judicial decision,"" he added, in an apparent reference to any possible retroactive actions.
Open pit mines target ore-rich soil from sprawling surface deposits that is scooped up by giant trucks. They are often criticized by environmental advocates for their impacts.
A government statement issued before the minister's remarks stressed the government ""will supervise"" some 28,000 hectares that have been granted in concessions for metallic and nonmetallic mining, but did not mention permit cancellations.
Medina's comments will likely soothe concerns over the future of Canadian company Aura Minerals' San Andres mine, an open-pit project in western Honduras.
The Aura Minerals project has been met by stiff local opposition in part due to alleged disturbances to a Maya-Chorti indigenous cemetery.
The new mining policies come from the month-old government of leftist President Xiomara Castro, who took office in January promising to pull the Central American nation ""out of the abyss"" caused by failed economic policies and rampant corruption.
Last year, Honduran mineral exports totaled $293 million, according to central bank data.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 08:40PM ET</span>",Rate-hike fears abate but Ukraine muddies stock market outlook,"By Lewis Krauskopf
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Geopolitical worries are clouding the outlook for U.S. stocks, even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine moderates expectations for how aggressively the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy in coming months. 
Concerns over the conflict weighed on the S&P 500 on Friday, as the index pared a rally that has seen it rise 5.2% from its Feb 24 intraday low. 
The see-saw moves come as investor hopes that the Fed may raise rates less severely than anticipated vied with worries about inflation and higher commodity prices, stoked by sanctions against Russia, one of the world’s biggest commodity exporters. 
Investors have virtually priced out the chances of a hefty 50 basis point rate hike in March, giving a lift to the technology and growth stocks that had been pummeled in recent weeks by anticipation of harsh Fed tightening. Among those, shares of software company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) was up over 5% since last week, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) up over 3% in the same period. 
""The stock market has been buoyed by expectations for a less aggressive Fed and lower yields in aggregate. The threat of higher interest rates has receded somewhat,"" said Brad Neuman, director of market strategy at Alger. 
The impact of moderating yields has been evident below the market's surface. Since the day before Russia launched its invasion last week, the S&P 500 growth index, replete with longer-duration stocks heavily pressured by higher yields, has climbed 2.6% against a 2.3% rise for the counterpart value index. That spread narrowed on Friday as the broad market fell. 
Meanwhile, geopolitical concerns have propelled oil prices, prompting fears of slower growth and higher inflation over the long term. U.S. crude prices topped $115 a barrel this week and hit their highest levels since 2008, while other commodities such as wheat also surged. 
""The Fed will be less aggressive now that Russia has invaded Ukraine in the near term, but the problem that the Fed faces has not been ameliorated,"" Neuman said. ""In fact, it has been exacerbated."" 
Investors next week will be watching data on U.S. inflation, due out Thursday. Consumer prices in January grew at their fastest pace in nearly four decades. 
For now, however, the run-up in U.S. Treasury yields, which move opposite to bond prices, has stalled. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed over 50 basis points to start the year to 2.065%, but has since pulled back and was last at 1.74%.
Strategists at  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) on Thursday upgraded their rating on U.S. equities, which are heavily weighted in tech stocks, to overweight, describing them as a ""classic"" growth trade. 
""Growth stocks were hit by rising real yields, but should benefit as they reverse,"" the Citi strategists wrote in a note.
Conversely, yield-sensitive financial stocks have struggled, with the S&P 500 banks index down nearly 8% since last week.
Truist Advisory Services this week lowered its rating on the financials sector to ""neutral"", while upgrading its ratings on two defensive groups, consumer staples to ""overweight"" and utilities to ""neutral."" 
""Because of what is happening overseas, it complicates the global picture,"" said Keith Lerner, Truist's co-chief investment officer. ""The global economy will be somewhat slower, capping rates, and by itself that is a negative for financials.” 

Some investors have been wary of the rebound in stocks. The  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute is re-evaluating its asset price targets in the wake of the Ukraine turmoil, ""but we don’t want to over-react when uncertainty is so high,"" said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells. 
""With geopolitics still lurking out there, it is going to be tricky for the market to make meaningful headway,"" Samana said.

1697,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2022 07:20PM ET</span>","Russia blocks Facebook, accusing it of restricting access to Russian media","By Elizabeth Culliford
(Reuters) - Russia is blocking Meta Platforms Inc's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the country's communications regulator said on Friday, in response to what it said were restrictions of access to Russian media on the platform. 
The regulator, Roskomnadzor, said there had been 26 cases of discrimination against Russian media by Facebook since October 2020, including restrictions in recent days on state-backed channels like RT and the RIA news agency. 
The move is a major escalation in an ongoing confrontation between big tech companies and Russia, which has in recent years issued a slew of fines and hobbled services through slowdowns. The tensions have ramped up amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation."" 
Tass news agency reported on Friday that Russia has restricted access to Twitter. Interfax news agency earlier said the service had been blocked.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Meta's head of global affairs Nick Clegg said the company would continue to do everything it could to restore its services.
""Soon millions of ordinary Russian will find themselves cut off from reliable information, deprived of their everyday ways of connecting with family and friends and silenced from speaking out,"" he said, in a statement posted on Twitter.
Meta in a blog said it was working to keep its services available ""to the greatest extent possible"" but it had stopped showing ads to users in Russia and barred Russian advertisers from running ads anywhere in the world ""due to the difficulties of operating in Russia at this time.""
Tech companies such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google have also paused advertising in Russia amid growing censorship demands.
Last week, Moscow said it was partially limiting access to Facebook, a move the company said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. On Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users.
Major tech companies have faced pressure to respond to the Feb. 24 invasion, which has led to economic sanctions against Moscow by governments around the world. Russian state-run media has emerged as a key flashpoint between Moscow and social media platforms during the conflict. 
Meta this week said it had restricted access to RT and Sputnik across the European Union and was globally demoting content from Russian state-controlled outlets' Facebook pages and Instagram accounts, as well as posts containing links to those outlets on Facebook. 
Russia has made several moves to crack down on foreign news media in recent days. It cut access to several news organizations' websites, including the BBC, Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty for spreading what it says is false information about its actions in Ukraine.
Ukraine's government had called on Meta and other platforms during the conflict to withdraw their services from Russia. Online speech experts and rights advocates have raised concerns about the impact of blocking online services for Russian citizens trying to organize or get information.
Meta had about 7.5 million users on Facebook in Russia as of last year and 122.2 million users across its other services, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, according to estimates from Insider Intelligence. The leading Russia-based social network VK had 63 million users, the researcher estimated.
Popular VPN apps have been downloaded more than 1.3 million times in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine began, according to data from researcher AppFigures, which described the figure as a major surge.
Meta was also one of several tech companies facing possible punitive measures in Russia after they failed to open local offices and take other measures required by a communications law passed this summer. 
Tech companies globally have pulled out of Russia in response to requests from governments or to signal support for Ukraine. U.S. internet provider Cogent Communications said on Friday it was cutting internet service to Russian clients.
Earlier this week, business software giant  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL) said it was suspending all operations in Russia, while rival SAP SE (DE:SAPG) said it would pause all sales in the country. A Ukraine government official had tweeted at both companies asking for support.

Roskomnadzor said in its statement that Meta had restricted access to the accounts of state-backed news outlets in recent days, listing RT, Sputnik, the RIA news agency, the defense ministry's Zvezda TV and websites gazeta.ru and lenta.ru. 
It said such restrictions violated the key principles of freedom of information and Russian internet users' unimpeded access to Russian media.

Chinese firms, which contributed 44% of the Russia handset market in 2021 according to Counterpoint, have so far stayed largely silent about their operations in Russia, as Beijing has refrained from criticizing Moscow for the invasion of Ukraine.
