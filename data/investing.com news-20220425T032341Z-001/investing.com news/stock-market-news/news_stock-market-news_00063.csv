SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Ultra-long flights like the 17-hour non-stop service Australia's Qantas is launching from Perth to London on Saturday are doing more than stretching aircraft ranges - they are lowering ticket prices for more conventional routes, data shows.
The latest round of global direct flights cost about 20 percent more than those with one or more stops, making them most popular with business travelers, agents say.
But the premium is deceptive. The difference in prices is mostly because the cost of tickets on conventional routes has been falling.
After United Airlines (N:UAL) started non-stop Singapore-Los Angeles flights last October, average ticket prices on one-stop rivals fell by 15 percent relative to 2016, according to  Expedia  Inc (O:EXPE) data provided to Reuters.
That meant customers willing to pay 20 percent extra to fly United and save a few hours were only paying 2 percent more than they would have paid for one-stop flights a year earlier.
""There is a lot of competitive pressure and those ultra-long haul flights are adding to it,"" said James Marshall, Expedia's vice president for transport partner services. ""The overall demand seems to be there but the pressure is on the price.""
NEW TECHNOLOGY
The number of ultra-long haul flights - those over 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 kilometers) - has nearly tripled to 19 over the last decade, according to travel data provider OAG, as smaller, fuel-efficient twin-engine planes like Boeing Co's (N:BA) 787 and Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) A350 have entered service.
""Being able to connect the major financial centers directly is going to be the main theme that is going to drive the success of these flights,"" said Richard Johnson, Carlson Wagonlit Travel's director of its solutions group for Asia Pacific. ""There needs to be premium demand and the airline needs to be the user of the newer generation of aircraft for any of these to be viable.‚Äù
Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) expects to revive the world's longest non-stop commercial flight, from Singapore to New York, in the second half of this year after a five-year hiatus due to the new aircraft technology and lower fuel prices. 
Most of the new ultra-long routes are flown once a day on jets with fewer than half the number of seats as A380 superjumbos and an upsized business class. Fears they would threaten the business model of hub carriers like Emirates and Qatar Airways have so far proven overblown.
Instead, demand is rising as prices fall.
 American Express  (NYSE:AXP) Global Business Travel said bookings on all types of flights from Singapore to San Francisco rose 12 percent last year, with Singapore Airlines and United now offering non-stop service on the route in competition with one-stop rivals like Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and Taiwan's EVA Airways Corp (TW:2618). 
Singapore Airlines also still offers a flight to San Francisco with a brief stopover in Hong Kong. An airline spokesman said there were markets for both types of flights with price, timing and connections among the factors. 
Some of the seats on non-stop flights are filled at lower prices with connecting passengers on routes like Sydney-Perth-London or Jakarta-Singapore-San Francisco.
PASSENGER MIX
Many seats on the non-stop flights will be filled with corporate travelers, but companies are often price conscious and want employees to select the best fare, regardless of travel time.
OAG's regional sales director for Japan and Asia-Pacific, Mayur Patel, said one-stop options in business class were popular on routes like Singapore-London because of the major price difference.
""A lot of people used to fly Singapore Airlines, but because of the pricing the Gulf carriers are gaining share,"" he said.
The average business-class ticket from Hong Kong to New York on non-stop flights with Cathay and United costs $8,600, compared with $7,200 on one-stop options, according to Carlson Wagonlit data, with Qantas achieving a $1,600 premium to rivals on Perth-London flights.
""That might be the distinction where ultra-long-haul non-stop becomes the preserve of the senior exec or those who maybe have more time-critical business,"" Johnson said.
Qantas (AX:QAN) International's chief executive, Ali Webster, said Perth-London flights that originate in Melbourne were also proving popular with corporate customers like mining companies BHP (AX:BHP) (L:BLT) and  Rio Tinto  (AX:RIO) (L:RIO), which have big offices in all three cities.

""It works very well for business travelers who can stop in Perth on their way from the east coast for meetings before carrying on to London,"" she said. ""That's exactly what a lot of our resources customers are doing.""

""My understanding is that there is tension (in the due diligence),"" Vice Finance Minister Ko Hyoung-kwon told reporters after a meeting in Seoul.
The audit on GM Korea's finances, which started earlier this month, will inform the South Korean government's decision on whether to provide support for the Detroit carmaker's loss-making Korean operations. 
General Motors has offered to convert debt of around $2.7 billion owed by its ailing South Korean operation into equity in exchange for financial support and tax benefits from Seoul. 
""In order to carry out due diligence, which is a difficult process, we need company information but I think (GM Korea) finds it difficult to share information about global strategies (with the KDB),"" Ko said. 
The state-run KDB, the second-biggest shareholder of GM Korea with a 17 percent stake, said that it was willing to offer short-term loans to GM Korea after April, should the company cooperate on the due diligence exercise. 
The restructuring plan will see GM's plant in Gunsan will shut down by May. Among its four plants, only one is running at full capacity and the other two are running at 50 and 70 percent of their capacity.

GM Korea, which employs nearly 16,000 people, has previously said that without new funding from its major shareholders it would have a first-quarter ""cash crisis"".

TEMPE, Ariz./SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Police in Arizona on Wednesday released a short video of a fatal collision between an Uber self-driving vehicle and a pedestrian, as investigators probe the accident that has put new focus on the safety of autonomous vehicles.
The video, taken from inside the Volvo XC90 sport utility vehicle that Uber has used for testing, shows the vehicle driving along a dark road when an image of a woman walking a bicycle across the road suddenly appears in the headlights. 
The woman, Elaine Herzberg, 49, later died from her injuries.
Police have released few details about the accident that occurred on Sunday night in Tempe, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, while the SUV was driving in autonomous mode. Uber suspended its self-driving testing in North America after the incident and federal safety regulators are conducting their own probe.
Fall-out from the accident could stall the development and testing of self-driving vehicles, which are designed to perform far better than human drivers and sharply reduce the number of motor vehicle fatalities that occur each year.
The video shows the vehicle traveling in the right-hand lane of a divided four-lane roadway. The vehicle's headlights illuminate a woman directly in front of it who is crossing the SUV's lane with her bike. The woman appears to be jaywalking as she is not in a crosswalk.
A photo released by safety regulators on Tuesday showed that the impact occurred on the right side of the vehicle. 
The footage also shows a view of the vehicle's interior and the driver at the wheel. The driver appears to be looking down, and not at the road, for two periods of about five seconds each. Just before the video stops, the driver looks upward toward the road and suddenly looks shocked.
""The video is disturbing and heartbreaking to watch, and our thoughts continue to be with Elaine's loved ones,"" Uber said in a statement. ""Our cars remain grounded, and we're assisting local, state and federal authorities in any way we can.""
The video is likely to be a key part of investigations of Uber's self-driving car technology and whether it was ready for testing on public roads.
Although the exact specifics of Uber's technology are not known, self-driving cars typically use a combination of sensors, including radar and light-based Lidar, to identify objects around the vehicle, including potential obstacles coming into range. While cameras do not perform well in the dark, radar and Lidar can work at night.
One question on regulators' minds will be why the sensors did not pick up on the presence of Herzberg, who would ostensibly have already crossed three lanes of traffic before arriving in the path of the Uber vehicle. 
One self-driving car expert, Bryant Walker Smith, said his first impression was of ""outrage"" viewing the video. 
""Although this video isn't the full picture, it strongly suggests a failure by Uber's automated driving system and a lack of due care by Uber's driver (and by the victim),"" said Smith, a professor of law at the University of South Carolina. 
Another autonomous driving expert agreed with Smith's assessment. 
""The sensors should have detected the pedestrian in this case; the cameras were likely useless but both the radars and the Lidar must have picked up the pedestrian,"" said Raj Rajkumar, a professor at Carnegie Mellon. 
""Though no information is available, one would have to conclude based on this video alone, that there are problems in the Uber vehicle software that need to be rectified,"" he said.
Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment on its systems.
OVERSIGHT?
The video is likely to renew calls for more oversight in a nascent industry that lacks standardized testing or safety definitions. Lawmakers have had to juggle the need to encourage innovations that promise to dramatically improve safety on roads with current public safety concerns.
Companies including Uber, Alphabet's Waymo (O:GOOGL) and General Motors's Cruise Automation (N:GM) have been testing their self-driving technology in Arizona, which has welcomed the industry with a lighter regulatory touch than in states like California, for example.
On Tuesday, Arizona transportation officials said they saw no immediate need to tighten rules on the testing of self-driving cars in the state.
Although some within the self-driving industry have suggested agreeing testing and safety standards for autonomous technology, there has been no concerted effort to do so.
Timothy Carone, an associate teaching professor at Notre Dame University's Mendoza College of Business whose research specialties include artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, said the question is whether Uber did enough testing before sending robot cars out onto streets alongside humans.

""Did they jump the gun?"" he said. ""If their testing is found to be inefficient, that cannot be allowed to happen again because these systems have to be ready for road tests.""

Meredith also said it had decided to explore a sale of Time, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money magazines after a review.
The move to sell the brands illustrates how Meredith sees some of Time's titles that attract primarily a male readership as not playing to its core strength in women's magazines.
Meredith, which owns lifestyle magazines such as Better Homes & Gardens and Family Circle, agreed to buy Time Inc in a $1.84 billion all-cash deal backed by conservative billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch.
Reuters reported last week about the company's plan to sell the Time Inc brands.
""There are guys who would like to own these marquee brands and are probably gonna pay more than what Meredith paid to acquire them,"" said Daniel Kurnos, an analyst with Benchmark Co. 
The company last month said it would sell Time Inc's UK arm to private equity firm Epiris Fund II.
The media company said the job cuts were part of a plan to achieve annual savings in the $400 million to $500 million range from the Time Inc acquisition, which closed in January.
The company has notified about 200 employees, while the around 1,000 more positions will be eliminated over the next 10 months.
Meredith needs to be more aggressive to reach its cost-cut targets and will likely have to lay off a lot more, said Craig Huber, an analyst with Huber Research Partners.

With its roots in traditional publishing, Meredith has been facing a fierce competitive online race against internet giants such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) for consumer eyeballs and advertising dollars.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The head of United Airlines (N:UAL) acknowledged on Wednesday that the carrier had made a mistake last week when a French bulldog puppy died on a United flight after a cabin attendant forced the dog's owner to stow it in an overhead bin.
""As hard as we try, it's obvious we don't always get it right,"" United Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz said at a gathering of The Executives Club of Chicago.
The 10-month-old puppy, Kokito, was found dead on arrival by his distraught family after a 3-1/2-hour flight from Houston to New York.
""It should have never, ever happened. We take this deeply seriously,"" Munoz said. 
The dog's death kicked off a weeklong rash of animal-related mishaps for the airline.
Following that incident, United reported two separate instances of shipping dogs onto the wrong flights, with one Kansas family's dog ending up in Tokyo. 
In another instance, a United flight carrying 33 passengers from Newark, New Jersey, to St. Louis was diverted to Akron, Ohio, after the airline realized that a pet had been mistakenly loaded onto the wrong flight.
In reaction to those mix-ups, United said on Tuesday it was suspending the shipment of pets in airplane cargo holds until an unspecified date while it studies improvements. That does not apply to pets flying in the cabin.
Speaking to CNBC on Wednesday, Munoz said United was reviewing the program and would not be suspending it permanently. 

""Doing away with something would be the simplest thing to do,"" Munoz¬†said on CNBC. ""That's not what we're going to do. That's not what United's about.""

(Reuters) - British consumer goods maker  Reckitt Benckiser  Group (L:RB) said on Wednesday it had ended discussions with  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) over buying its consumer healthcare business, a day before the U.S. drug company was expecting binding offers for the unit.
Reckitt's exit from the sale process strengthens the hand of British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline Plc (L:GSK), which sources familiar with the matter said was working on an offer for the business. It is possible that Pfizer will receive more offers by Thursday's deadline for bids, the sources added.
""An acquisition for the whole Pfizer consumer health business did not fit our acquisition criteria and an acquisition of part of the business was not possible,"" Reckitt said.
Reckitt's priority would remain organic growth and integration of Mead Johnson Nutrition, the British company said in a statement.
""Pfizer continues to evaluate potential strategic alternatives for the consumer healthcare business, which include a spin-off, sale or other transaction, and Pfizer ultimately retaining the business. We have not yet made a decision, but continue to expect to make one in 2018,"" Pfizer said in a statement. 
A deal would be the boldest move to date for GlaxoSmithKline CEO Emma Walmsley, took over last April. It would further increase the company's already substantial position in consumer health, an increasingly lucrative sector as aging populations and health-conscious consumers drive demand for self-medication.
Pfizer has been hoping to fetch as much as $20 billion for its consumer health business, which includes well-known over-the-counter brands such as the Advil painkiller, Centrum multivitamins and Chapstick lip balm, according to the sources.
Although consumer remedies sold over the counter have lower margins than prescription drugs, they are typically very well known and durable brands with loyal customers.
GlaxoSmithKline has struggled with a scarcity of promising new drugs in its pipeline at a time of mounting competition in its core respiratory and HIV divisions.
Adding Pfizer's consumer healthcare business would likely boost GlaxoSmithKline's earnings, given the economies of scale the enlarged business would enjoy, but would also stretch GlaxoSmithKline's finances, analysts have said. 
GlaxoSmithKline runs its consumer healthcare business via a joint venture with  Novartis  AG (S:NOVN). Novartis has the right to sell down its minority stake starting from this month, although it has previously indicated it is in no rush to do so. 
""You would expect us to take a serious look at any leading and very appealing assets in the sector because we are a world leader in consumer healthcare and have a very good track record of integrating businesses successfully,"" GlaxoSmithKline's Walmsley said last month. 

""We will be extremely focused on discipline around returns and frankly, this is not a need to do.""

1. Dollar to Rebound or Suffer Post-Fed Hangover?
With the Federal Reserve decision out of the way, market focus is expected to return to economic data, with initial jobless claims, manufacturing and services data slated for Thursday. 
The Labor department releases its weekly count of the  number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended March 16, expected to show a drop to 225,000 from 226,000 the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are expected to have increased to 1.890 million from 1.879 million.
Economists forecast manufacturing PMI to show a preliminary reading of 56 for March while services PMI is expected to improve on the prior month reading of 55.9.
The Bloomberg Consumer Confidence Index ‚Äì which measures views on the condition of the U.S. economy, personal finances and the buying climate ‚Äì will also be closely monitored after easing slightly last week.
The dollar fell sharply against a basket of major currencies Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest by 0.25% but left its inflation forecasts roughly unchanged as labour market tightening is expected to ease in the years ahead.
‚ÄúWe're reading this as somewhat dovish because the Federal Reserve decision is anticipating benign inflation despite nearly 3% growth, said Bank of Montreal following the Federal Reserve decision. ""
2. Natural Gas Inventories; Crude Rally in Focus
Natural gas prices snapped a three week winning streak last week and made a poor start to the week falling two out of past three days.
The Energy Information Agency‚Äôs weekly natural gas storage report is expected show gas storage fell by 87 billion cubic feet last week.
Crude oil prices, meanwhile, settled 2.6% higher at $65.17 a barrel, a six week high on Wednesday amid a surprise draw in U.S. crude supplies and investor expectations that President Donald Trump may adopt a tougher stance on Iran, which pave the way for the president to opt against waiving sanction in May.
2. Facebook: More Pain or Time for Gain? 
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) recovered some its losses Tuesday, after bouncing off lows of $1.63, after CEO Mark Zuckerberg attempted to quell customer and investor concerns amid the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal.
In a nearly 1000-word Facebook post, Zuckerberg vowed to notify users whose data was allegedly farmed by Cambridge Analytical.
He also laid out measures to ensure Facebook user data would be protected including an investigation into all apps with access to Facebook data, and an audit of apps with suspicious activity.
Additional measures highlighting in the post included launching a tool at the top of the News Feed, providing users with the option to revoke any app from accessing their data.
This comes as Sandy Parakilas ‚Äì former platform operations manager at Facebook ‚Äì claimed that he warned senior executives at the company about its soft approach to data protection."

21,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 05:37PM ET</span>","Deere & Co fears hit from Trump tariffs, retaliation: CEO","By Maximilian Heath
GRANADERO BAIGORRIA, Argentina (Reuters) - U.S. tractor maker Deere & Co (N:DE) is bracing for a negative financial impact from U.S. tariffs on steel imports and worries that retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural exports could follow, Chief Executive Samuel Allen told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
The 25 percent tariffs, which U.S. President Donald Trump announced last month along with a 10 percent tariff on aluminum, could raise steel prices by 30 percent and may prompt the company to switch materials, Allen said at an event marking Deere's 60th year of production in Argentina. 
""That would have an even longer negative impact on the steel industry,"" Allen said. ""There are a lot of unintended consequences we hope people think about as they go down the path of tariffs.""
Beyond the hit from higher input prices, Allen said the tariffs could prompt some of the United States' major trade partners like Canada, Mexico and China to retaliate by putting tariffs on imports of U.S. agricultural products like corn or soybeans.
That reflected broader fears that Trump's tariffs could set off a global trade war. The tariffs were aimed at hitting Chinese over-production, but also hit key allies like the European Union, Canada and Mexico, though the latter two have been granted an exemption.
""The near-term impact financially we don't like, but the more important one is the longer-term potential impact taking U.S. farmers out of the world market for corn and soybeans,"" Allen said.
The United States is the world's No. 2 exporter of soybeans and top exporter of corn, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

Allen added that Deere would absorb the costs of higher steel prices and ""work aggressively"" to cut other costs to offset the impact.

25,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 04:20PM ET</span>",French lawmakers seek scrutiny over Macron on foreign takeovers,"PARIS (Reuters) - France's government should subject foreign takeovers of French firms it has cleared to parliamentary scrutiny, a senior lawmaker said after a series of cross-border deals prompted criticism of President Emmanuel Macron's industrial policy.
The loss of control over high-speed TGV train maker  Alstom  (PA:ALSO), first via the acquisition of its power business by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and then a takeover of the remaining transport business by Germany's Siemens last year caused ructions in French political and business circles.
At a time when some other western powers have been flirting with or adopting protectionist policies, lawmakers voted to set up a parliamentary inquiry into that decision and others, including the foreign takeovers in recent years of cement maker Lafarge and cable company Alcatel-Lucent (PA:ALUA).
Macron's role in the transactions - from his time as his predecessor Francois Hollande's economic adviser to his current position - was criticized by opposition lawmakers for breaking with a long tradition of protecting France's corporate jewels.
The head of the inquiry, opposition MP Olivier Marleix of the conservative Republicans, told Reuters that weeks of question of officials involved in these cases had led to a consensus among MPs that more parliamentary scrutiny was needed.
France should follow the example of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a security panel that can block foreign takeovers, and make the equivalent French committee report to lawmakers.
""Without parliamentary control, these things are managed behind closed doors and in a half-baked kind of way,"" Marleix said in an interview.
The government should inform the heads of parliament's defense and finance committees about all foreign takeovers it has approved, explaining its decision and conditions given, Marleix said.
An annual report should also be published.

The lawmakers involved in the inquiry will introduce an amendment to an incoming bill sponsored by Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, Marleix said. It remains to be seen whether it will be adopted.

STRATFORD, Ontario (Reuters) - A Canadian town known for its annual theater festival is emerging as a hub of ""snowtonomous"" research, as automakers face demands to produce self-driving cars that can perform in snow and sleet. 
But testing driverless cars in cold climates brings added challenges to an industry grappling with the first fatality involving an autonomous vehicle. 
On Sunday, an Uber Technologies Inc self-driving sport utility vehicle hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Arizona. 
Blackberry (TO:BB) said on Wednesday it will continue testing its self-driving concept car on the road in Ottawa.The Canadian province of Ontario, which allows autonomous vehicles on roads only if there is a human driver behind the wheel, has said it would follow the Arizona investigation and take ""action if warranted."" 
Canada's largest city, Toronto, is one of three places where Uber tests driverless technology - the other cities are Phoenix, Arizona, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Automakers, ride services companies and others are investing in self-driving technology said to reduce accidents, and the costs of a driver, with robo-taxis expected to hit the road as early as this year. 
A wider rollout, however, is expected to take years, if not decades, as companies work to prove autonomous vehicles can run not just in balmy U.S. states, where they are mostly tested, but in colder areas like Ontario and Michigan where snow and sleet can render cameras and sensors ineffective.
Ross McKenzie, managing director of the Waterloo Centre of Automotive Research, recalled how a vehicle's lidar, which uses laser light to help autonomous cars ""see"" nearby objects, once mistook an ice patch for a pothole. 
McKenzie's research team at the University of Waterloo responded by tweaking the sedan's software so it would factor in the time of year and weather when driving in the snow and ice, conditions that autonomous vehicles will have to navigate to be commercially viable.
The car needs to consider ""we have winter driving conditions because I'm in Canada, it's November and it‚Äôs 15 below,"" McKenzie said by phone. 
Ontario, which has lost automaking jobs to lower-cost Mexico in recent years, is counting on the lure of its snowy winters and the strength of its automotive and software engineering sectors to establish a ""Silicon North."" Since 2016, Ontario has attracted about C$1 billion ($765 million) in private-sector investment for autonomous and connected cars.
In Stratford, where the theater festival is an important employer of its 31,000 residents, the city-wide wireless network and weather are helping to attract companies researching connected driving technologies. Ubiquitous Wi-Fi gives companies the option to test vehicle-to-vehicle communication over a 4G band, McKenzie said.
HARSH WINTERS
Japanese semiconductor manufacturer  Renesas Electronics Corp  (T:6723) chose Ontario as the site of its only autonomous test-track because of the harsh winters, along with its proximity to Blackberry's QNX unit which produces the operating system.
The use of high-definition maps helps self-driving vehicles more easily navigate in the snow, even when road markings are not visible, said John Buszek, Renesas' Michigan-based director of the company's autonomous and advanced driver-assistance division.
Renesas' Lincoln MKZ sedan, which does not currently drive autonomously on public roads, is still equipped with enough backup cameras and sensors to keep running even if one gets covered in sludge, Buszek said. 
""In order for the car to have enough sensors to be robust against all different types of climates it means there are going to be a lot of sensors,"" he said during at a recent demonstration at the chipmaker's track in Stratford, Ontario.
While extra cameras, sensors and lidar work well on the track, consumers are less keen on the cost, appearance and inefficiency of a car covered with such lenses. Some automakers are looking at protective coatings to keep a smaller number of lenses free of sludge.
""Ultimately those sensors that you would see on the car today have to be integrated into the car system,"" said Justin Gammage, industry liaison manager at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology's Automotive Centre of Excellence (ACE) in Oshawa, Ontario. 
""Customers will pretty much want a car to look like a car looks today, even if has all the autonomous features.""
Gammage, formerly General Motors Co's (N:GM) chief scientist in Canada, said researchers are still looking at non-stick coatings as a cost-effective way to protect lenses.
He has yet to find a one-size-fits-all-coating.
""They all have varying degrees of performance. And it's really dependent on what type of conditions they are working in,"" he said. ""One coating might work really well in snow, but not as well in rain. And vice versa."" 
When self-driving vehicles fail to receive enough data through their cameras, sensors and lidar due to bad weather, they simply will not be able to drive autonomously, McKenzie said.
The public should not expect self-driving vehicles to hit the road in conditions that humans would avoid.
""If I'm not able to get into a car because we're two steps short of a monsoon, why would we expect an autonomous vehicle to operate?""

BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. retirement plans pumped billions of dollars into investment trusts last year, helping asset managers offset some of the heavy cash outflows from their pricier actively managed funds.
Assets in collective investment trusts, or CITs, run by T. Rowe Price Group Inc soared 54 percent last year to $88.9 billion. And assets in 16 CITs managed by Fidelity Investments rose 31 percent to $85.6 billion, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Department of Labor reports.
CITs mirror popular mutual funds run by the same firms and produce similar returns. 
The trend reflects a broader shift of money from more expensive funds run by stock-pickers to cheaper options that passively track indexes. Actively managed funds suffered $207.5 billion in net withdrawals across the United States last year, according to Morningstar Inc.
""What we have seen is a migration from higher cost mutual fund shares to what we call the i-class, and then to collective investment trusts,"" Scott David, head of T. Rowe's individual and retirement plan services, said during the company's investor day last month.
T. Rowe clients made net withdrawals of nearly $6 billion from the Baltimore-based company's actively managed funds last year, while Fidelity saw $47 billion in outflows from those funds. The firms are No. 4 and No. 2, respectively, in terms of U.S. actively managed mutual fund assets.
CITs have been around for nearly a century, but have only grown meaningfully in recent years. They cost less because they are not regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and therefore do not have to provide prospectuses or install independent boards of directors, removing layers of expense.
CITs are expected to become even more popular as investors continue to embrace cheaper retirement options. 
The Wisconsin Deferred Compensation Program, for example, plans to transfer about $685 million currently invested in Fidelity's Contrafund mutual fund to the cheaper Contrafund CIT. Both investment vehicles are run by Fidelity's celebrated stock-picker William Danoff. 
The move, expected this year, would save nearly 20,000 participants currently invested in Contrafund about $550,000 a year in combined expenses, or nearly $30 per participant. The expense ratio would drop as much as 17 percent, according to retirement plan officials.
Launched just four years ago, The Contrafund CIT currently has $22 billion in assets, doubling in the span of two years, U.S. Department of Labor reports show. Its investors are a who's who of blue-chip company retirement plans, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), General Motors (NYSE:GM) and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).
Overall, assets in CITs could top $3 trillion this year, outpacing the growth of the overall retirement market, according to ALPS, a subsidiary of software and research firm DST Systems Inc. 
Although CIT regulation operates through a patchwork of oversight from the Labor Department, the Internal Revenue Service, state banking divisions and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, legal experts say investment trusts do not pose major risks to investors. 

""There's no independent board, but the mindset of the asset managers is to treat clients the same, regardless of regulatory regime,"" said Scott Webster, a partner at law firm Goodwin Procter LLP who has dealt with CIT matters for more than 20 years.

35,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 02:12PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Rosneft, Eni fail to discover oil at Black Sea well - source","By Denis Pinchuk
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's state oil company Rosneft (MM:ROSN) and Italy's Eni (MI:ENI) did not make a commercial oil discovery in the Black Sea as the well they were drilling proved to be dry, a source close to the operations told Reuters on Wednesday. 
Rosneft chief executive, Igor Sechin, has partnered with a number of foreign companies to develop Russia's offshore regions, though western sanctions have forced some of its partners such as ExxonMobil (N:XOM) to suspend projects.
Sechin has counted on the Black Sea as an area with high potential and any discovery would help send a message that the sanctions will not seriously hamper Rosneft's global standing or cooperation with other global players. 
But the well, ""Maria-1"", which Rosneft and Eni started to drill in December, did not bring the desired results, a source close to operations said. Rosneft had planned a second well if the first showed hydrocarbon potential.
""There will be nothing. Nothing was found,"" the source familiar with the operation said. ""Demobilization (of equipment) has started.""
Eni, which holds a 33.33 percent stake in the Zapadno-Chernomorskaya project, declined to comment. 
In the Black Sea, Rosneft faces a technically challenging project. ""Not a single well has been drilled in the deep water Russian offshore (in the Black Sea),"" Sechin said back in December. 
The ultra-deep-water prospecting and appraisal well was drilled using the Scarabeo-9 rig and Rosneft said this week it had a target depth of 6,126 meters.
CHALLENGING PROJECT
Contrary to previous statements when Rosneft has discovered oil, on Wednesday the company confirmed that drilling was complete and referred only to finding a ""carbonate structure"".
""As a result of the work, a unique carbonate structure... was discovered, which is a fractured reservoir that is highly likely to contain hydrocarbons,"" Rosneft said, without giving details of how much or what type of hydrocarbons the structure may contain.
""The obtained results inspire confidence in the discovery of large oil and gas deposits in the Russian area of the Black Sea,"" Rosneft said, adding that it will now carefully study the material received by the drilling. 
The wording contrasts with Rosneft's statement following the completion of drilling on the first well in its Kara Sea project in September 2014.
Back then, Rosneft reported it found oil and Sechin took a group of reporters and TV crews to the Kara Sea.
Valery Nesterov, an analyst with Sberbank CIB, said that given there was no information about any oil flow from the ""Maria-1"" well, Rosneft may need additional drilling. 
""The issue of carbonate structures is a high oil movement inside a layer,"" Nesterov said. The high movement means that oil can migrate from one part of the structure to another and can be hard to track, if at all.
According to ThomsonReuters tracking data, the Scarabeo-9 rig started to move to the Romanian port of Constanta on March 19 and is expected to arrive there on March 24. 
Eni, in contrast to its global peers, does not yet have any oil producing projects in Russia and has teamed up with Rosneft in the Black Sea and the Barents Sea in Russia's Arctic. 
Nesterov said that it was important to note that Eni has not pulled out of the partnership with Rosneft, despite what he described as 'not very active' cooperation. ""Eni does not announce the exit and this is positive,"" he said. 
Rosneft said last December that oil resources in the license area in the Black Sea were estimated at over 570 million tonnes, or equal to more than two years of Rosneft's current oil production. 
The partnership has yet to begin drilling in the Barents Sea.

42,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 01:31PM ET</span>",Academic in Facebook storm worked on Russian 'dark' personality project,"By Denis Pinchuk and Douglas Busvine
MOSCOW/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The psychologist at the center of a scandal over the misuse of millions of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users' personal data worked with Russian researchers on a study of toxic personality traits.
Aleksandr Kogan advised a team at St Petersburg State University that was exploring whether psychopathy, narcissism and machiavellianism - dubbed the 'dark triad' by psychologists - were linked to abusive online behavior, said Yanina Ledovaya, senior lecturer at the university's department of psychology.
""We wanted to detect (internet) trolls in order to improve in some way the lives of people suffering from trolling,"" Ledovaya told Reuters.
Kogan, a lecturer at Britain's Cambridge University who also goes by the married name of Spectre, has come under fire for passing data culled via a Facebook personality quiz to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.
The test was taken by a few hundred thousand people but the app on which it ran also collected details about all of their Facebook 'friends' without their knowledge or consent.
That data was then used in a targeted digital ad campaign in support of Donald Trump's successful run for the U.S. presidency, Cambridge Analytica's CEO Alexander Nix told an undercover reporter from Britain's Channel Four news. 
Nix was suspended on Tuesday in a spiraling scandal over how the data came into his company's hands, in violation of Facebook's own rules. The saga has wiped nearly $50 billion off the social network's market value.
Kogan did not respond to an emailed request to comment on his work in St Petersburg, but told the BBC on Wednesday he was being made a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. The latter firm has no link to the university.
NO DATA LEAK
Ledovaya said Kogan had advised the St Petersburg team on the project - which was funded by a university grant - between 2015 and 2017, visiting rarely and mainly interacting from abroad.
The team built a Facebook app using a 61-question survey for Russian-speaking users that sought to determine to what degree they had the 'dark triad' traits.
The app collected answers, as well as the public data of respondents, after securing their consent. Separately, the researchers analyzed the text of users' public Facebook posts.
Ledovaya said the data gathered was not passed to anyone outside the five-member research team - nor was it shared with Kogan.
""We don't have the right to share the data of these 10,000 or so people with anyone - it's a matter of ethics and we are sticking to it,"" she said.
Research into personality traits viewed as malevolent goes back at least to Sigmund Freud, the Viennese pioneer of psychiatry who identified narcissism - or excessive self-love.
Machiavellianism, named after the Italian diplomat and writer of the Renaissance era, represents manipulative behavior, while psychopathy manifests a lack of empathy. 
Ledovaya said one goal of the project was to ascertain the mental wellbeing of the respondents and, as appropriate, offer free counseling.
RUSSIAN CONNECTION
The emergence of Kogan's St Petersburg connection comes as relations between Moscow and the West plumb new lows. Kogan, a U.S. citizen, was born in the former-Soviet republic of Moldova but moved to the United States as a child, Britain's Guardian newspaper said.
U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller has indicted 13 Russian individuals and three Russian companies for criminal and espionage conspiracy to tamper with the U.S. presidential campaign.
One line of inquiry being pursued by Mueller is the suspected use of targeted Facebook messages by Russian groups - including the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Bureau.
The St Petersburg State University research team has nothing to do with the Internet Research Bureau, said Ledovaya. 
""I know the people involved in the research project very well - they are the last people I can imagine taking part somehow in such an activity,"" said Vladimir Volkhonsky, who worked at the psychology faculty until 2011.
Cambridge University said Kogan had correctly sought the permission of the head of the psychology department to do the work with St Petersburg.

""It was understood that this work and any associated grants would be in a private capacity, separate to his work at the university,"" it said in a statement.

45,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",EU financing arm ready to boost bloc funding after Brexit,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union's financing arm, the EIB, on Wednesday offered to help offset a financing gap caused by Britain's departure from the bloc and other emerging needs by leveraging higher budgetary guarantees and other financial instruments.
The European Investment Bank (EIB.UL), which is owned by the European Union's member states, uses its capital deposits as security to fund loans for research, infrastructure and environmental projects in Europe and around the world.
Britain's exit from the bloc will leave a hole of 10 to 13 billion euros in the EU budget, according to some estimates, reducing funding available for infrastructure and other projects, but the EIB argues that increased use of its financial instruments can help plug that gap.
An EIB spokesman said the bank's could ""significantly increase"" its funding in Europe if the share of resources from the EU budget used as guarantees was raised from 3 percent to 5 percent.
The German Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, which first reported the proposed increase, said that would boost the guarantee volume by 3 billion euros to around 7.8 billion euros.
""The EIB stands ready to use more financial instruments during the next multiannual financial framework, guaranteed by EU budget resources,"" a spokesman for the bank said. 
Alexander Stubb, EIB vice president, told the newspaper: ""We will help to ease the pain of Brexit."" 
He said the bank could not completely offset the loss of Britain's funding after 2020, but it could ease the pressure.
Any increase in the budgetary guarantees would have to be approved by the European Parliament and EU member states, the EIB spokesman said.
The changes, together with or instead of more traditional grants and subsidies, could help the EU ""do more with less"", he said. 

Using financial instruments such as loans and equity finance leveraged the EU budget by drawing in private investors, while ensuring the economic viability of projects, because recipients must repay these loans.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 01:20PM ET</span>",Former UAW official charged in expanding corruption probe,"By Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - A former United Auto Workers official who served on the union's committee that negotiated a 2015 labor agreement with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) was charged on Wednesday with accepting illegal payments from the automaker. 
The charges are part of an expanding U.S. Justice Department investigation into alleged misspending at UAW union training centers. 
The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan said charges had been filed against Nancy Johnson, 57, who served as the second most senior UAW official responsible for the union's FCA department from 2014 to 2016. 
Johnson was charged with participating in a conspiracy in which she and other union officials ""accepted a stream of concealed payments and things of value from FCA executives in the months leading up to the 2015 collective bargaining negotiations,"" the attorney's office said in a statement.
According to court documents, Johnson illegally accepted tens of thousands of dollars worth of designer clothing, golf resort fees, luxury accommodations and first-class travel.
Johnson could not be reached for comment and a lawyer for Johnson could not immediately be identified. 
Alphons Iacobelli, 58, a former vice president of employee relations at Fiat Chrysler, pleaded guilty in January to making at least $1.5 million in improper payments to UAW officials.
Iacobelli's plea agreement states that he paid out FCA funds in cash and items of value to UAW officials and employees to obtain concessions for FCA in negotiating and implementing collective bargaining agreements between the automaker and the union, and to influence union decisions on pension funds.
Last month, the widow of former UAW Vice President General Holiefield, the union official at the center of the U.S. probe, pleaded guilty to tax fraud in relation to the case. Holiefield died in March 2015.
The UAW did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. But in a letter to rank-and-file members in January, UAW President Dennis Williams said claims that payments to Holiefield had compromised contract talks or impacted union funds were baseless.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Apollo CEO sees Ares offering little incentive for stock conversion,"By Joshua Franklin
BOSTON (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management LLC Chief Executive Leon Black on Wednesday downplayed the possibility that his private equity firm would follow peer Ares Management LP in converting from a publicly listed partnership into a corporation.
Ares' decision last month to become a so-called C-Corp has been monitored closely by rivals such as Apollo, Blackstone (NYSE:BX) Group LP and KKR & Co LP, which are looking to see whether the higher tax burden associated with the switch will be offset by the ability of more investors to buy the stock.
Ares shares jumped as much as 13.9 percent in February when it announced its intention to convert into a C-Corp, but the stock has since given up these gains.
This does not make following Ares' move compelling, Black said at the PartnerConnect East conference in Boston.
""(Ares) had a little bit of a bump in their (valuation) multiple but not that much. ... If you got a real multiple uplift maybe that makes sense. But it has to be sustainable.""
Apollo's shares are up 37 percent in the last 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500 Index, which is up 16 percent. 
Private equity firms have taken a fresh look at making the C-Corp change after the recent U.S. tax overhaul slashed the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. Many of them are frustrated that their stocks trade at a discount to traditional asset managers, such as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).
Switching to a C-Corp expands a firm's shareholder base by enabling investors such as index funds to buy the stock, and also strips out some of the tax complexity.
However, it is practically irreversible in the near term and would mean firms would pay corporation tax in addition to the capital gains tax they already pay on the longer-term returns generated for investors.
Investors are wary of private equity's complex structure and assign substantially less value to the more volatile performance fees earned by these firms than to their stable management fees. This has led to the valuation disparity with traditional money managers.
""I agree one is more stable than the other in terms of predicting it, but that's a pretty crazy spread,"" Black said.

75,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 11:36AM ET</span>",Target could be the biggest winner in the Toys R Us sweepstakes," Target is well positioned to be the biggest beneficiary of the Toys R Us liquidation, according to a  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) note from analyst Seth Sigman.  Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy Thursday, and will begin  liquidating its stores and inventory. 
While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could compete for those assets, Sigman says Credit Suisse sees Target ""benefiting disproportionately"" to its peers. The key reason is that most Toys R Us stores are right next to Target stores. 
With 90% of Toys R Us stores and 96% of Baby R Us stores within five miles of Target stores, ""TGT's overlap is higher than in recent case studies, and should be positioned to take a fair share,"" the note said. Target, it estimated, ""captures 15% of addressable Toy R Us store sales, 5% of Baby R Us sales, and 5% of online sales,"" a total value of $600 million. 
This visual shows just how many Toys R Us and Baby R Us stores are close to Target stores.
The report arrives at its conclusion through a case study that showed when retail stores are liquidated, other retailers with a high number of stores near the liquidating store were the main beneficiaries.
When H.H. Gregg closed, Best Buy was able to capitalize on 6-11% of H.H. Gregg sales, Sigman said. Twenty-two percent of Best Buy stores were within five miles of H.H. Gregg stores.
Additionally, when Sports Authority closed, Dick's Sporting Goods was able to capture roughly 10% of its sales, the note said. Dick's had 28% of its stores within five miles of a Sports Authority. 
Comparatively, 52% of Target stores are within five miles of Toys R Us stores, which leads Credit Suisse to believe that Target is the favorite in the Toys R Us asset sweepstakes. 
But competition may still prove to be thick. Sigman noted 82% of Toys R Us stores have both a Target and a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) nearby.
Target is up 5.22% year-to-date. "
76,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 11:35AM ET</span>",JPMorgan says it's found the perfect trade for worried Facebook investors,"As worries mount around Facebook's ongoing scandal, some traders are likely at a loss for what to do.
The company's stock has plummeted 9% in just two days ‚Äî its biggest such drop in more than two years ‚Äî and now investors find themselves at a crucial juncture. Do they bet on further turmoil for the tech juggernaut, or do they position for a rebound?
Lucky for them, the equity derivatives team at JPMorgan has an options strategy that they think is the ideal way to play these uncertain conditions.
At the root of JPMorgan's recommendation is a bullish stance on the company's underlying fundamentals. Facebook's business isn't currently being impacted by the scandal, and first-quarter engagement trends are actually improving, according to the firm's internet analyst, Doug Anmuth.
Not to mention Facebook's current valuation, which, after its recent rough patch, looks the most attractive it's been in months.
So with all of this in mind, it's probably best to just get directionally bullish on Facebook and call it a day, right? Not so fast, says JPMorgan, which argues the likelihood of a full rebound will remain low until investors get more clarity on Facebook's relationship with political-research company Cambridge Analytica, and how much liability the tech giant has.
Still, JPMorgan has been encouraged by Facebook's willingness to present in front of a judicial committee, and remains confident the company's stock can recover from its recent beating ‚Äî just not for a little while.
That's why JPMorgan's big options recommendation on Facebook is scheduled to expire in May. Not to mention that timing will allow the trade to capture the company's early-May earnings report.
Without further ado, here's the derivatives team's top Facebook trade: buy Facebook $185 calls and simultaneously sell $150 puts, both expiring in May. The trade, known as a risk reversal, will be profitable if the stock sees a big recovery.
""Clarity on the Cambridge issue and FB‚Äôs willingness to self-regulate are likely near-term catalysts that may reduce investor fears, stabilize the stock, and position it for a recovery into Q1 results,"" Shawn Quigg, an equity derivatives strategist at JPMorgan, wrote in a client note."
77,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 10:32AM ET</span>",Insurers' new business: 'active shooter' policies for U.S. schools,"By Suzanne Barlyn and Noor Zainab Hussain
(Reuters) - Insurance broker Paul Marshall can count on his phone ringing in the aftermath of a school shooting.
Since the Feb. 14 shooting at a Florida high school, where 17 people were killed and more than a dozen injured, seven South Florida school district have bought $3 million worth of ""active shooter"" coverage that Marshall's Ohio-based employer, the McGowan Companies, began selling in 2016.
""Every day we get a phone call from another school district,"" Marshall said. 
The insurance, which is backed by XL Catlin (N:XL) covers expenses tied to shootings in places such as office buildings and concert halls, and is increasingly gaining traction with schools. It pays up to $250,000 per shooting victim, for death and serious injuries, such as blindness or total disability, with additional medical coverage depending on how much insurance a district buys.
There is no detailed survey of insurance coverage at U.S. schools, but insurers say it is only within about the past year that more schools have been seeking ""active shooter"" and ""active assailant"" policies. 
School districts often find that their general liability policies fall short on coverage for the cascade of bills that follow a violent incident like the mass shooting last month in Parkland, Florida, insurers and school administrators say.
The costs can include victim lawsuits, building repairs, legal fees, medical expenses and trauma counseling, as well as media consultants, accountants to handle charitable contributions, and even reconstruction of buildings where bloodshed occurred.
""This is a very sort of unique and specific issue that we are facing"" Chris Parker, who heads a unit at Beazley PLC (L:BEZG) that writes policies for political violence, terrorism and other risks, said about coverage for U.S. schools.
On Tuesday, a student who shot and critically wounded two fellow students at a Maryland high school died after exchanging gunfire with a campus security officer. 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of the February shooting, is covered under a general liability policy through its local school district, which does not spell out whether shootings are covered, a spokeswoman said.
That was also true at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a gunman killed 26 people in 2012. A wrongful death lawsuit filed by families of two children killed there seeking unspecified sums has dragged on since 2015.
In the case of public schools, state laws that exempt them from liability or limit the payouts can leave survivors and their families with huge medical expenses. Those laws can have exceptions and in some states, such as Florida, the legislature has authority to waive such limits. 
Still, the process can take years and while school employees are generally covered through workers' compensation insurance some shooter policies could help families meet some of the medical costs.
CROWDFUNDING FOR SURVIVORS
Some desperate families have turned to crowdfunding sites. For instance, Royer Borges is using GoFundMe to raise $1 million for his son Anthony, a Parkland student who has undergone eight surgeries since being shot five times during the massacre.
Anthony has insurance through a government sponsored-program for children, but it is unclear how much it will cover, his lawyer Alex Arreaza said.
The privately-owned McGowan Companies, fielded 10 times the number of queries in February about shooting coverage and inked three times more policies than a year before, according to Marshall.
Some coverage has been around since 2011, but more insurers, including Beazley, XL Catlin,  Hiscox  Ltd (L:HSX) have launched such policies since 2016, as mass shootings showed no sign of abating. 
For example, insurance broker  Jardine Lloyd  Thompson Group (L:JLT) recently began selling coverage to help terror and mass shooting victims, including at schools, and a Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) unit in June began offering schools $100,000 in additional coverage for reimbursement of violent event expenses.
Premiums can range anywhere from $1,400 per year for $1 million in coverage for a small private school to $50,000-$100,000 for a $5 million to $10 million policy for a large public school district, industry executives said.
While one insurance executive described the market for school shooter policies as ""embryonic"" sales have been rising. As a result, premiums have come to about a third of what they cost two years ago, Marshall said. He is now developing a policy that covers construction costs for school districts that want to demolish buildings where shootings occurred.
In 2013, officials in Newtown, Connecticut, voted to tear down Sandy Hook Elementary School and the state gave the town $50 million for the new building.
A Florida school safety law signed on March 9 includes $25.3 million to replace the building at the Parkland high school where the shooting occurred.
Church Mutual Insurance Co in Merrill, Wisconsin, which insures private and religious schools nationwide, has been fielding calls from customers who want to raise coverage beyond the $50,000 per victim and up to $300,000 per violent incident it already offers through its general liability policies, said chief underwriting officer Ed Hancock.
Nate Walker, vice president of sales at insurance wholesaler Special Markets Insurance Consultants (SMIC), an AmWINS Group Inc unit, said the company considered a name change for its ""Active Shooter Insurance Program,"" offered since 2014 as part of a broader package aimed at schools, because it was a tough-sell. 

""The more events that happened, the more we came to say there's no reason to call this anything other than what it is,"" Walker said. ""You can't really sugarcoat this.‚Äù

81,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 10:20AM ET</span>",Deutsche Boerse could be fined for not updating market on CEO search,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's financial markets watchdog is investigating whether Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) should have provided more information to investors during its search for a new chief executive, with a ruling against the company potentially leading to a fine. 
A spokeswoman for the BaFin watchdog said it was looking into whether the German stock exchange operator should have publicly disclosed that a personnel committee on the supervisory board had on Nov. 13 narrowed its CEO search to two candidates. 
On Nov. 16, Deutsche Boerse announced that Theodor Weimer would be its new chief executive officer.
German law requires companies listed on an exchange to publish information that could affect share prices in a timely fashion. The rules are in place to prevent insider trading.
Failure to do so can in theory cost up to two percent of a company's annual revenue, or 48 million euros ($59 million) in this case.
A spokesman for Deutsche Boerse said the company took its duties to promptly inform the public very seriously. ""These duties were also carefully considered in the selection and appointment of a new chief executive officer,"" he said.
Instead of waiting three days to announce the final decision, Deutsche Boerse could have been required to announce that it had short-listed two individuals, without naming names, said a person familiar with the matter. 
That could have cleared up concerns about a leadership vacuum, said the person, who was speaking on condition of anonymity due to the ongoing investigation.
Separately, BaFin has dropped an inquiry into a July 18 announcement by Deutsche Boerse about the status of an investigation into its previous CEO, the BaFin spokeswoman said.
WirtschaftsWoche first reported the news on BaFin's investigations.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers in Britain are getting ready to shift business to Europe in their first ""irreversible"" Brexit move to continue paying claims on policies bought by millions of customers, industry officials say.
Britain was hoping the transition agreed with the European Union on Monday would persuade financial firms to avoid moves that could damage the financial industry, its biggest tax payer.
But like banks and asset managers, insurers say in practice transition means more time to implement plans for coping with Britain's departure from the EU, not changing their plans.
""The insurance industry has not waited for the political process to deliver outcomes that will enable it to avoid the logical consequences of Brexit, that is leaving the single market,"" Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, told Reuters.
Many ABI members are seeking court approval to transfer business to EU hubs and end uncertainty over policies, Evans said.
Lloyd's syndicate Beazley (L:BEZG) has said it is setting up a new subsidiary in Dublin.  Hiscox  (L:HSX) is going to Luxembourg.
Ten million British policyholders and 38 million European policyholders with business worth more than 80 billion pounds ($112 billion) don't know if their insurers could pay out on a claim after Brexit, the Bank of England has said.
""Insurers keep telling us that this question is what keeps them awake at night,"" said Nicolas Mackel, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, which promotes the duchy as a financial center.
Bruce Carnegie-Brown, chairman of Lloyd's of London, the world's biggest commercial insurance market, said using the same valuer for transferring policies would help speed up the legal process, rather than each syndicate hiring its own.
""We're a long way from the courts and actually the whole transition arrangements announced this week are helpful in that regard because they give time to get ourselves organized,"" Carnegie-Brown said.
MOVING CLIFF EDGE
Moving contracts, like relocating staff, is an ""irreversible"" step - companies do not want to repeat the legal process or have to obtain customer approval again.
Insurers are not alone. It is unclear if it would be legal to amend derivatives contracts to reflect ""lifecycle events"" like rolling forward positions. The BoE has said derivatives trades worth about 26 trillion pounds ($36.55 trillion) between EU and British parties may be affected.
""We welcome progress on the transition agreement, but it's important we have a solution that allows all lifecycle events to continue on existing derivatives trades between UK and EU counterparties,"" said Scott O'Malia, chief executive of ISDA, a global industry body.
Banks in Britain are also readying to ""repaper"" or transfer accounts from London to EU hubs.
Chris Bates, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance, said transition simply pushes the Brexit ""cliff edge"" to the end of 2020.
""The draft does not contain provisions dealing with legacy contracts at the end of the transition. This may be dealt with in any long-term agreement if that comes into effect immediately at the end of transition,"" Bates said.
The BoE has said a transition deal won't be enough to avoid disrupting cross-border financial contracts.
While Britain is willing to legislate on cross-border contracts, Brussels has been silent in the face of industry calls to ""grandfather"" them - give legal permission for multi-year cross-border contracts to run their course.
This EU stance, lawyers say, is aimed at putting pressure on financial firms not to delay opening new EU hubs or move business and staff to existing ones.
AIR COVER
Carnegie-Brown is confident grandfathering will be agreed at some stage.
""These contracts were entered into in good faith, and a bit like Deutsche mark contracts and French franc contracts were grandfathered into the euro, the same should happen here and it's slightly disappointing that it hasn't already happened,"" he said.
Financial firms hope that grandfathering will be slipped into the wider withdrawal agreement being negotiated between Britain and the EU.
""The problem is that this will have to come somewhere near the end of the negotiations,"" Mackel said.
Britain and the EU aim to ratify the withdrawal agreement, which contains transition arrangements, by October, too close to Brexit day for some financial firms to rely on.
British regulators say a transition deal could give ""air cover"" for them and their EU counterparts to begin discussing how to tackle supervisory issues like contracts. But European regulators say transition needs to be ratified first.
""It would be ridiculous for people to have paid out their premiums and not be able to claim on their contracts at the end of the day. It's in all our interests to find a solution,"" said Catherine McGuinness, City of London policy leader.

85,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 10:02AM ET</span>","China intellectual property filings soar, hard to judge if it plays fair: U.N.","By Tom Miles
GENEVA (Reuters) - China is now a major producer of innovative technologies, nosing ahead of Japan to become the second biggest source of international patent applications, the United Nations said on Wednesday.
China's fast growth in intellectual property has led to accusations by U.S. President Donald Trump that it has stolen American ideas, but the head of the U.N. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) said it was hard to tell.
""The reality is a new competitor has arrived,"" WIPO Director General Francis Gurry told a news conference in Geneva.
""We will just observe what occurs now but I would say that the commercial, economic and geopolitical reality that we must take cognizance of is that China has arrived as a major technological competitor.""
At current rates China will overtake the United States to become the biggest source of international patent applications in the WIPO system within three years, WIPO said.
The top filers of patent applications at WIPO in 2017 were Chinese technology companies Huawei [HWT.UL] and ZTE Corp (SZ:000063), followed by U.S.-based  Intel Corp  (O:INTC), Japan's Mitsubishi Electric Corp (T:6503) and the U.S. company  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM).
China's applications for international trademarks in WIPO's system rose 36 percent last year and it was clear the country had gone from being a consumer of technologies to a producer of technologies, putting it at the heart of a global innovation race, Gurry said.
China's top leadership had taken an extremely strategic approach to turn China into the laboratory of the world, with policies aimed at fields such as artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.
It was up to individual countries to decide how to respond, Gurry said. There were plenty of anecdotes about China's behavior but assessing if it had played by the rules was a huge question.
""You‚Äôre talking about a very complex innovation ecosystem, comprising regulatory framework, institutions, individual actors across a vast country. I don‚Äôt think one could take a judgment on that question even without an extremely careful analysis of a huge amount of detail and evidence.""
China's patent applications at WIPO have recorded double-digit annual growth in every year since 2003.
Trump told Reuters in January he was considering imposing a big fine on China for intellectual property theft.
He is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting technology, telecommunications and intellectual property, two officials briefed on the matter said on Monday.
Gurry said he could not comment on the U.S. complaint since he had not yet seen any evidence, nor did he know what would be proposed. WIPO would not adjudicate such a dispute, but China might take its complaint to the World Trade Organization.

87,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 10:18AM ET</span>","Deutsche Bank sees $550 million first-quarter impact from strong euro, funding costs","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A strong euro and higher funding costs would have a 450 million euro ($553 million) impact on  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in the first quarter of the year, the German lender's finance chief warned on Wednesday.
James von Moltke, the bank's chief financial officer, said a stronger euro was turning out to be a 300 million euro drag on the investment bank, while the cost of funding would be an additional 150 million euros. 
""We do have a headwind on a year-on-year comparison before you get to business performance of about 450 million euros,"" von Moltke said at an investor conference in London. 
The outlook for the first quarter comes after the bank posted three consecutive years of losses. Last week, it disclosed an even bigger than previously disclosed 2017 loss of 735 million euros but expressed cautious optimism about 2018.
""We remain committed to our objective of delivering a net profit and a competitive dividend payout for 2018,"" Deutsche's Chief Executive Officer John Cryan said on Friday.
Shares in the bank were down 5.7 percent at 1344 GMT.
Von Moltke noted that the first quarter of last year was a strong one, complicating the picture when comparing the first quarter of this year. 
The revenue base of Deutsche Bank's investment bank is 40 percent dollar denominated or linked to the dollar, von Moltke said when explaining the negative currency effect of a stronger euro. ($1 = 0.8139 euros)

Such measures are ‚Äúcounterproductive to economic growth,‚Äù Chief Executive Officer Fred Smith said on a conference call Tuesday to discuss earnings. Smith said he was ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù that Trump‚Äôs plans to impose trade duties would undermine a broad-based global expansion and dent the benefits of lower U.S. corporate tax rates.
‚ÄúThe better approach is to encourage open markets and free exchange of products and services and to reduce barriers to trade,‚Äù Smith said on the call. He went on to instruct listeners to search for the dictionary definition of tariff, calling it ‚Äúa tax or a duty to be paid on a particular class of imports or exports.‚Äù
In assailing the president‚Äôs plans, Smith joined companies from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). that have warned of economic pain from sweeping trade actions. Trump, who announced duties on steel and aluminum imports this month, is planning to impose tariffs worth $60 billion against China as early as this week, according to reports in media outlets including the Washington Post and Bloomberg News.
Mixed Results
FedEx is a direct beneficiary of global commercial links. The Memphis, Tennessee-based courier increased its profit forecast for the second straight quarter amid ever-expanding online purchases. While it‚Äôs getting a boost from higher prices and package volumes for ground-delivery services, it‚Äôs struggling to maintain profit margins in its Express air-freight business as volumes declined and costs rose.
‚ÄúWe view this quarter as a bit of a disappointment due to weakness in the Express business,‚Äù said Logan Purk, an analyst at Edward Jones. ‚ÄúHowever, we were pleased the company showed improvement in the ground business and maintained guidance for the TNT Express integration.‚Äù
FedEx acquired TNT in 2016 to secure a European ground network. Packages will flow across the combined FedEx-TNT network by May 31 and global sales forces will be aligned in fiscal 2019, a year earlier than expected, the company said.
Adjusted earnings for fiscal 2018, which ends in May, will be $15 to $15.40 a share, the company said. Three months ago, the company predicted $12.70 to $13.30. Even after excluding the benefit from U.S. tax cuts, the midpoint of the profit outlook was 81 cents a share higher than the previous forecast, Purk estimated.
The stronger outlook is based on ‚Äúforeign tax benefits from our international corporate structure, the benefits from U.S. tax reform and improved operating performance,‚Äù FedEx Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in the earnings statement.
FedEx fell 1.6 percent to $247.88 after the close of regular trading in New York. The shares climbed 1 percent this year through Tuesday, compared with the 1.6 percent increase in the S&P 500 Index. UPS fell 9.3 percent during the same period.
Adjusted earnings for the fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28 rose to $3.72 per share, compared with the $3.11 average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 10 percent to $16.5 billion. Analysts had predicted $16.2 billion.
Investment Plan
FedEx reduced its capital spending plan by $100 million to $5.8 billion, including $1.4 billion to complete its integration of TNT. FedEx accelerated the effort after the unit was hit by a cyberattack in June, boosting costs to mesh the companies from an original estimate of $800 million.
FedEx said in January it would spend $3.2 billion to increase wages, fund pensions and expand its Express hub in Indianapolis as a result of U.S. tax reform that it expects to boost the economy and domestic investment.
Those investments were made without an increase in capital spending plans. Separately, the company said last week it would invest $1 billion over six years to build a new Express hub in Memphis.
CEO Smith said the company is assisting authorities in a probe after a package exploded at a FedEx sorting facility near San Antonio. Two parcels at two separate FedEx locations are connected to four blasts in Austin, Texas, earlier this month, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in a joint statement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Austin police.

The brokerage cut its target for the California-based firm by $20 to $210, still way above the current share price of $165 but adding to signs that Wall Street analysts are waking up to the risks to the company. 
A 1.6 percent fall in Facebook shares in premarket trading brought the losses in the company's market value this week to $57 billion, or 10.5 percent - a shock for a company that has risen more than 550 percent in value in the past five years.
The suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his UK-based political consultancy's online campaign played a decisive role in U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election victory.
CEO Alexander Nix's comments, which could not be verified, were potentially a further problem for Facebook as it faces U.S. and European scrutiny of Cambridge's improper use of 50 million Facebook users' personal data to target voters. [nL1N1QZ02Q]
""We ... anticipate that the stock will be subject to further headline risk in the coming weeks as senior management is summoned to DC for hearings with lawmakers,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Stephen Ju wrote in a note.
Many analysts have now raised concerns that the incident will have a negative impact on user engagement with Facebook, potentially eating into its clout with advertisers. There are mixed views, however, on whether an aggressive regulatory response will materialize.
So far, U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.
Cowen and Co analyst Paul Gallant said that Congress is unlikely to act on the issue. He said that despite allegations of Russian interference, a bill requiring Internet companies to disclose foreign buyers of political advertising is going nowhere. 
""We don't expect Congress to enact online privacy legislation anytime soon, even if Democrats win the House this fall,"" Gallant said.
On Tuesday another brokerage Evercore ISI cut their target by $20 to $205, their biggest reduction ever. Macquarie Research also trimmed its by $5 to $200, the first reduction since Oct 2012, five months after Facebook stock market launch.
""Investors now have to consider whether or not the company will conclude that it has grown in a manner that has proven to be untenable or whether it needs to significantly improve how it is managed,"" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.

 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said they expected Facebook to bring changes to how data are made available to app developers and third parties, adding it could have a negative impact on Facebook Audience Network's ability to scale, although minimal.

ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC) and Mubadala Investment Co, two investment arms of the super-rich emirate's government, will join up as Abu Dhabi consolidates hundreds of billions of dollars worth of funds under its control.
""An investment vehicle of such scale will enhance the country's competitive position,"" Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed said as he revealed the plan on his official Twitter account on Wednesday.
ADIC will become part of the Mubadala group, with a combined portfolio worth over $200 billion, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters.
United Arab Emirates state news agency WAM said ADIC's board would now report to Mubadala's board, with Eissa al-Suwaidi remaining executive director of ADIC. It did not give details of how the funds' strategy might change under the new arrangement.
ADIC started operating in 2007 and is responsible for investing worldwide part of the Abu Dhabi government‚Äôs surplus financial resources, earned from oil exports.
Mubadala, itself formed by a merger last year involving another Abu Dhabi fund, International Petroleum Investment Co, had assets worth 465.5 billion dirhams ($126.8 billion) at the end of last June and made a net profit of 4.2 billion dirhams in the first half of 2017.
Abu Dhabi, the richest of the seven emirates that form the UAE, has ridden out the last few years of low oil prices relatively comfortably, but it has been seeking to save money and make many of its assets more efficient by streamlining them or arranging tie-ups.
On Tuesday officials announced that Aldar Properties (AD:ALDR), Abu Dhabi's top real estate developer which is about 30 percent owned by Mubadala, would form a joint venture with Dubai's Emaar Properties (DU:EMAR) to develop local and international projects worth as much as 30 billion dirhams.
It was not immediately clear whether the ADIC news presaged more mergers or tie-ups for Abu Dhabi funds. The emirate's biggest sovereign fund, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, has an estimated $828 billion of assets and is the third biggest in the world.

111,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 08:31AM ET</span>","It's Not Just Facebook. Big Tech Revolt Has Begun, Nomura Says","(Bloomberg) --  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB).‚Äôs terrible week may be just the beginning of a backlash against tech companies that could wreak havoc across global markets.
Nomura Inc. currency strategist Bilal Hafeez warned that a host of factors, from populism to tighter regulation, are converging to undercut tech stocks at a time when their valuations are near extreme levels. The fallout could sweep far beyond the confines of equity markets, weighing on currencies and benefiting haven assets like the yen, Hafeez wrote in a note published Tuesday.
‚ÄúThe bottom line is that trade wars, populism, income inequality can be looked at in isolation, but together they all point to a reaction against the growth of fluid intangible-intensive industries such as the data/platform companies,‚Äù he said.
Shares in technology-related firms have slumped this week after a disclosure that Facebook released data of 50 million users to an analytics firm that helped elect President Donald Trump. Just last week, investors were pouring cash into the sector at a rate not seen since the height of the dot-com bubble. Hafeez didn‚Äôt mention the Facebook controversy specifically in his note.
A fundamental trigger for the bursting of the tech bubble will be the shift toward a more populist political climate that means that U.S. policy is shifting back toward more tangible asset industries, such as manufacturing, according to Hafeez. Other catalysts include increased scrutiny about how social-media data is being used and tighter regulation.
‚ÄúToday thanks to the increasing concerns that platforms and data-holders have been ‚Äògamed‚Äô by corporations and foreign governments to manipulate consumers and voters, there is a growing backlash from individuals and governments on how these platforms can operate,‚Äù Hafeez said. ‚ÄúFor governments, this could result in greater regulation on how and where the data/platform companies can operate.‚Äù"

113,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 09:02AM ET</span>","Designed in California, made in China: how the iPhone skews U.S. trade deficit","By Adam Jourdan
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump often tweets from his iPhone about pressuring China to address its $375 billion trade surplus with the United States. But a closer look at the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) smartphone reveals how the headline figure is distorted.
The big trade imbalance - at the heart of a potential trade war, with Trump expected to impose tariffs on Chinese imports this week - exists in large part because of electrical goods and tech, the biggest U.S. import item from China.
Apple Inc's iPhone, however, illustrates how a big portion of that imbalance is due to imports of American-branded products - many of which use global suppliers for parts but are put together in China and shipped around the world.
Take a look at the iPhone X. IHS Markit estimates its components cost a total of $370.25. Of that, $110 goes to Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) in South Korea for supplying displays. Another $44.45 goes to Japan's Toshiba Corp and South Korea's SK Hynix for memory chips.
Other suppliers from Taiwan, the United States and Europe also take their portion, while assembly, done by contract manufacturers in China like Foxconn, represents only an estimated 3 to 6 percent of the manufacturing cost.
Current trade statistics, however, count most of the manufacturing cost in China's export numbers, which has prompted global bodies like the World Trade Organization to consider alternative calculations that include where value is added.
The impact on export data of just the iPhone could be major.
Apple shipped 61 million iPhones to the United States last year, data from researchers Counterpoint and IHS Markit show, spending $258 on average to make each iPhone 7 and 7 Plus.
Using a rough calculation, that implies the iPhone 7 series added $15.7 billion to the U.S. trade deficit with China last year, about 4.4 percent of the total. That's also about 22 percent of the $70 billion in cell phones and household goods the U.S. imported from China.
""With an iPhone, where China is just the final assembler, most of the value (contributed by China) is just the labor rather than the components themselves,"" said John Wu, an economic analyst with a U.S.-based think tank, the Information & Innovation Foundation.
Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics research at Oxford Economics, notes that U.S. companies' using global supply chains to manufacture products in China means other economies would be caught in the crossfire of a trade war.
""That is an important reason why U.S.-China trade friction will cause 'collateral damage,' especially in other Asian economies,"" he said, adding that in value added terms, the U.S. trade deficit with China was only $239 billion last year, 36 percent lower than the headline number.
For its part, Apple has responded to Trump's concerns with a pledge to bring some suppliers to the United States. It said in January it planned to pay $55 billion to U.S. suppliers this year.
Graphic: Manufacturing the iPhone X http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-TRADE-CHINA/010061872L2/iphone-cost.jpg
DESIGNED IN CALIFORNIA
Over the last decade, Apple shipped 373 million iPhones, worth $101 billion by manufacturing value, in the United States, according to researcher StrategyAnalytics. 
The iPhone's contribution to U.S. trade deficits is almost certain to have grown sharply alongside higher retail prices and shipments.
But the manufacturing value does not include the intellectual property value Apple adds through engineering and design work done in its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., as well as margins taken by distributors.
The iPhone X has a manufacturing cost of about $400, an $800 wholesale cost, and a $1,200 retail unsubsidized cost, according to analysts.
Siri, Apple's ""digital assistant,"" reflects the challenge of knowing exactly where the value of an iPhone comes from - even if it's put together in China. If users ask Siri where she is from, the response is: ""Like it says on the box... I was designed by Apple in California."" 
The closely intertwined manufacturing ecosystem has led to warnings that a trade war would be painful for all sides.
For a graphic on U.S. imports from China click http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/US-CHINA-TRADE/0100617Y2K6/us-china-trade.jpg
Forty-five U.S. trade associations representing some of the largest U.S. companies urged the president on Sunday not to impose tariffs on China, warning it would be ""particularly harmful"" to the U.S. economy and consumers.
Retailers and shoemakers, including Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), also sounded the alarm on Monday over concerns the plans would result in higher consumer prices. 
A 10 percent tariff levied on Chinese electronics imports would slow the growth of U.S. output by $163 billion over the next 10 years, and a 25 percent tariff would slow output by $332 billion, according to the Information Technology & Innovation Foundation.

Kuijs wrote that both sides would likely show restraint. All-out economic war, he added, ""would cause major economic damage globally.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended slightly lower on Wednesday, with major indexes giving up gains in choppy trade after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates, while a strong gain in the energy space helped limit losses.
The Fed raised interest rates and forecast at least two more hikes for 2018, signaling growing confidence that U.S. tax cuts and government spending will boost the economy and inflation and lead to more aggressive future tightening.
The hike was widely expected, and new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a news conference after the rate-hike announcement that the U.S. central bank was trying to take the ""middle ground"" in raising rates.
""That's a Fed that really feels good about the economy, not only this year but into next year,"" said Jim Paulsen, Chief Investment Strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.
""The initial response by equities was to go up because of the confidence the Fed seems to have in the economy. But with bond yields going up in anticipation of more hikes ..., that kind of scared the stock market again."" 
Financials (SPSY), which benefit from a higher rate environment, briefly extended gains in the wake of the announcement but lost ground to close down 0.03 percent. Names sensitive to higher rates such as utilities (SPLRCU), down 0.39 percent, and real estate <.SPLRCR>, off 0.93 percent, were under pressure.
Stocks were choppy following the Fed announcement, as yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note (US10YT=RR) moved closer to 3 percent, touching a one month high of 2.936 percent. 
Stocks have struggled this year while bond yield have moved higher. 
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 vs U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield - http://reut.rs/2ptJdIs)
Energy (SPNY) jumped 2.63 percent and helped lift equities for a second straight session. Crude oil prices hit a six-week high after a surprise decline in U.S. inventories and as concern persisted over possible disruption to Middle East supply. 
Markets participants are still trying to decipher the number of rate hikes this year - whether the Fed will stay at three increases as previously forecast by policy makers, or whether a fourth hike is possible.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 44.96 points, or 0.18 percent, to end at 24,682.31, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 5.01 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,711.93 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 19.02 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,345.29.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares gained 0.74 percent to stem its recent sell-off over the past two days, which cost the social media company about $50 billion in market value after reports of data misuse that raised broader questions about consumer privacy and the need for tougher regulation.
The company chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, said Facebook ""made mistakes"" in a statement.
 General Mills  (N:GIS) slumped 8.85 percent after the company cut its full-year profit forecast due to higher freight and commodity costs.
That weighed on other food companies, with Kellogg (N:K) off 3.98 percent, JM Smucker (N:SJM) down 4.20 percent and ConAgra (N:CAG) off 2.94 percent.
Southwest Airlines (N:LUV) fell 4.79 percent after the carrier cut its forecast for a key revenue metric. Other airlines also fell, with the NYSE Arca Airline index (XAL) down 1.09 percent. 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.35-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.72 billion shares, compared to the 7.16 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

125,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>",Formerly detained Saudi businessmen Alwaleed and Alhokair in talks for loans,"By Davide Barbuscia, Tom Arnold and Marwa Rashad
DUBAI (Reuters) - Two businessmen formerly detained a part of Saudi Arabia's anti-corruption campaign are now in talks with banks for loans for their firms in excess of $3 billion, sources said, suggesting that bank markets are open again for those who have reached financial settlements with the government.
Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal's investment firm  Kingdom  Holding (SE:4280) is in talks for a loan worth up to $1 billion, while Saudi fashion retailer Fawaz Abdulaziz  Alhokair  (SE:4240), whose major shareholder Fawaz Alhokair was also detained, is in discussions with banks for a loan of around 8 billion riyals ($2.13 billion).
Local banks are expected to provide most of the debt, while international banks appear to be more cautious given the lack of clarity over the terms of settlements the business figures reached with the Saudi authorities, banking sources said.
Alhokair was not immediately available for comment, while Kingdom Holding confirmed in an email to Reuters that it has started talks again with local and international banks in order to raise up to $1 billion.
Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman launched a sweeping anti-graft crackdown last November, arresting dozens of princes, senior officials and top businessmen accused of crimes such as money laundering, bribing and extorting officials.
Saudi officials said earlier this year that several detained businessmen had reached financial settlements with the government amounting to over $100 billion in total. Among them were prince Alwaleed ‚Äì Saudi Arabia‚Äôs most prominent business figure ‚Äì and Fawaz Alhokair, released from detention at the end of January.
Prince Alwaleed confirmed to Bloomberg TV this week that he had reached an agreement with the government although he did not disclose any details, saying the agreement was ""confidential and secret.""
No details of the financial settlement reached by Fawaz Abdulaziz Alhokair has been made public either, bankers said. According to one banking source familiar with the matter, the settlement could involve Alhokhair‚Äôs personal wealth, rather than shares in his company.
Kingdom Holding‚Äôs plans to borrow funds for new investments stalled last November when the prince was detained, several sources told Reuters at the time, indicating that the crackdown had slowed down new Saudi business activity.
Discussions on the 8 billion riyals loan for the retailer Alhokair had also started before the anti-graft campaign, but the financing was held up when Fawaz was detained.
The loan is now about to be completed. It will be used to refinance existing debt and will be provided by a group of local banks including Al Rajhi Bank and Samba Financial Group, sources said.
Kingdom Holding is working with a group of banks including Arab National Bank and Samba Financial Group for the new financing, which would be backed by the company‚Äôs shares in Banque Saudi Fransi, sources said. Prince Alwaleed told Bloomberg TV earlier this week that he was ‚Äúon the verge‚Äù of obtaining debt facilities worth $1 billion and $2 billion.
He also said Kingdom Holding was planning to split its $13 billion of assets by spinning off its domestic property and other holdings.
None of the banks responded to a request for comment.
The planned loan has no recourse to Kingdom Holding itself. ‚ÄúUltimately the financing was never dependent on the credit worthiness of Alwaleed himself, the loan was always going to be secured against the shares in Saudi Fransi and probably some top-up shares in  Citigroup . But with him in detention, banks put everything on hold, obviously,‚Äù one source said.
Alwaleed is a longstanding major shareholder in Citigroup. (N:C)
Two bankers working in the region at international banks said, however, that too many questions have remained unanswered regarding Prince Alwaleed‚Äôs release and his financial settlement, and that international lenders are likely to be more cautious than their local counterparts in dealing with Kingdom Holding.
‚ÄúFurther clarity is still required about the future. The only thing I know is that they might split the assets into two. That‚Äôs not enough information to convince me to lend,‚Äù one of them said.

128,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 07:32AM ET</span>",FOMO Grips Wall Street Bankers as Big Uber Debt Deal Slips Away,"(Bloomberg) -- For the select group of Wall Street bankers who specialize in doling out leveraged corporate loans, these are exciting, and anxious, times.
Exciting because they‚Äôve been told by regulators in the Trump administration that they‚Äôre now freer to take on more risk. Anxious because they‚Äôre waiting for those instructions -- which were communicated verbally at an industry conference last month -- to be turned into official policy so that they can have the confidence to start pursuing the kinds of deals that used to land them in trouble.
Deals like the loan expected to price in the coming days by Uber Technologies Inc. With the memory still fresh in their minds of how a similar Uber loan agreed in 2016 earned them a reprimand from regulators, some banks held back from the deal, people familiar with the matter said. Uber marketed it directly to investors. (Demand was so strong that the transaction was boosted to $1.5 billion on Monday before word emerged that an Uber self-driving car fatally struck a pedestrian.)
There‚Äôs a palpable sense of FOMO in the air on Wall Street: When  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) was named an adviser to Uber on the transaction, some of its rivals fumed in private. What exactly did an advisory role entail, they wondered, and was it just a workaround that allowed the bank to arrange and distribute the loan for Uber the way that a traditional bookrunner would. A representative for Morgan Stanley declined to comment as did a representative for San Francisco-based Uber.
‚ÄúYou are in a period of limbo,‚Äù said Michael Alix, a partner at PwC and a former Federal Reserve official. And it ‚Äúis uncomfortable for everybody.‚Äù
While the pace of change is quickening now in the leveraged loan market, it has actually been underway for a while. Ever since President Donald Trump came to office, compliance with the leveraged loan guidance, as it is known, started to weaken, helping drive debt ratios in the riskier corporate loan market to record levels. That may be OK when earnings are posting strong growth, like now, but the concern among more cautious policy makers is how these loans perform when profits start to slump and borrowing costs climb.
The lending guidance in question emerged in the aftermath of the financial crisis to prevent debt-heavy buyouts that hobbled firms -- the effects of which are still being felt, with iHeartMedia Inc. filing for bankruptcy just this month. The guidance has been under fierce discussion amid Trump‚Äôs hands-off stance on regulation, which has already unraveled other post-crisis rules.
Debt Limit
The guidance included one particular provision to cap the debt banks could pile on to companies. Lenders were limited from providing debt in excess of six times a measure of earnings, knowing any such deal would likely attract regulatory scrutiny. The instructions also emphasized the borrower needed to show it could repay a significant portion of the total loans over a sustained period.
Uber‚Äôs loan plan, on the face of it, would stretch at least some of those stipulations. The company still does not generate positive earnings, according to documents seen by Bloomberg News. That makes its leverage ratio mathematically meaningless. At its loan pitch in New York earlier this month, it touted its growth prospects, its $10 billion liquidity position, as well as its $5.7 billion of pro-forma cash, as it sought to attract investors directly rather than going through banks.
And the company‚Äôs ability to boost the size of the loan is a sign it‚Äôs hotly demanded by investors who‚Äôve been deprived of juicier yields as interest rates remained low.
Powell, Otting
What‚Äôs accelerated the desire for clarity from lenders are explicit statements from two regulatory agency heads. Joseph Otting, the comptroller of the currency, said at a Las Vegas conference in February that banks ‚Äúshould have the right to do the leveraged lending they want as long as they have the capital and personnel to manage that and it doesn‚Äôt impair their safety and soundness.‚Äù Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in testimony to lawmakers that it may put the current guidance on riskier lending out to consultation. Both said the instructions were not meant to be viewed as binding.
The life of the leveraged lending guidance wasn‚Äôt straight forward. Regulators published it in 2013 though it had to be clarified in 2014 before banks understood and complied. Last fall, the Government Accountability Office said the more stringent guidance amounted technically to ‚Äúrules‚Äù. The distinction was important because it meant as rules, they need to be submitted for Congressional review. That had never happened, leading some to say they shouldn‚Äôt be enforced.
‚ÄòSafe, Sound‚Äô
‚ÄúRegulators were never clear as to where the goal posts were,‚Äù said Mark Okada, co-chief investment officer of Highland Capital Management. They ‚Äúapplied the guidelines arbitrarily in an attempt to simply reduce leveraged lending in total.‚Äù
The guidance was issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. A representative for the Federal Reserve declined to comment.
A representative for the FDIC said it ‚Äúdistinguishes between the requirements of laws and regulations, which are legally binding and enforceable, and supervisory guidance, which itself is not enforceable but sets forth information, including the factors the FDIC considers when exercising its supervisory authority.‚Äù
The OCC provided written comment that leveraged lending ‚Äúmust be conducted in a safe and sound manner.‚Äù That included maintaining appropriate policies, procedures, controls, and personnel competency commensurate with the level of risk presented by the bank‚Äôs leveraged lending activities, it said.

130,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",U.S. judge to question Big Oil on climate change,"By Dan Levine
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Five of the world's biggest energy producers will be questioned by a federal judge on Wednesday about climate change science, part of a lawsuit that accuses the companies of misleading the public for years about their role in global warming.
The cities of San Francisco and Oakland, California sued  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM), ConocoPhillips (N:COP), Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L:RDSa), and  BP  PLC (L:BP) last year, seeking an abatement fund to help the cities address flooding they say is a result of climate change.
The companies argued in legal filings on Tuesday that the case in San Francisco federal court should be dismissed, partly because Congress has given regulatory agencies, not the courts, authority over the production and emission of fossil fuels. 
The lawsuits, filed by Democratic Party politicians, are part of a larger campaign to address climate change in the courts. Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits on climate change in 25 countries, a U.N. study said last year.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup invited both sides to a hearing on Wednesday to describe their views on ""the best science now available on global warming, glacier melt, sea rise, and coastal flooding.""
Since U.S. President Donald Trump took office 14 months ago, domestic policy on climate change has been turned on its head. Republican Trump has pushed to increase production of fossil fuels and ordered a broad reversal of climate regulations. He said last year that he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement to reduce emissions but Washington has not disengaged from it completely.

135,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 02:29PM ET</span>",Bayer wins EU approval for $62.5 billion Monsanto buy,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German conglomerate Bayer (DE:BAYGN) won EU antitrust approval on Wednesday for its $62.5 billion buy of U.S. peer  Monsanto  (NYSE:MON), the latest in a trio of mega mergers that will reshape the agrochemicals industry.
The tie-up is set to create a company with control of more than a quarter of the world's seed and pesticides market.
Driven by shifting weather patterns, competition in grain exports and a faltering global farm economy, Dow and Dupont, and ChemChina and Syngenta had earlier led a wave of consolidation in the sector.
Both deals secured EU approval only after the companies offered substantial asset sales to boost rivals.
Environmental and farming groups have opposed all three deals, worried about their power and their advantage in digital farming data, which can tell farmers how and when to till, sow, spray, fertilize and pick crops based on algorithms.
The European Commission said Bayer addressed its concerns with its offer to sell a swathe of assets to boost rival BASF, confirming a Reuters story on Feb. 28.
""Our decision ensures that there will be effective competition and innovation in seeds, pesticides and digital agriculture markets also after this merger,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
""In particular, we have made sure that the number of global players actively competing in these markets stays the same.""
Vestager said the Commission, which received more than a million petitions concerning the deal, had been thorough by examining more than 2,000 different product markets and 2.7 million internal documents to produce a 1,285-page ruling.
The U.S. Justice Department, which is also reviewing the merger, said in a statement on its website that it would press on with its review and that the market in the two regions was quite different.
""While genetically modified seeds are largely prohibited in Europe, they are widely used throughout the United States,"" the department noted. ""The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice continues to examine the effects of the proposed transaction on American farmers and consumers.""
China has given conditional approval to the Bayer and Monsanto deal, which has won a green light in Brazil. It is currently being reviewed by Russian antitrust authorities too. 
Bayer has already reached a deal to sell certain seed and herbicide assets for 5.9 billion euros ($7.2 billion) to BASF and to give it a license to its global digital farming data. It will also divest its vegetable seeds business to BASF. 
The Commission is due to rule on the BASF deal by April 16.
Online campaigns group Avaaz criticized the EU approval.
""This is a marriage made in hell. The Commission ignored a million people who called on them to block this deal, and caved in to lobbying to create a mega-corporation which will dominate our food supply,"" Avaaz legal director Nick Flynn said.
U.S.-incorporated Avaaz, funded by its members, is active in climate change, poverty, conflict and corruption issues.
The Greens grouping in the European Parliament echoed the sentiment, saying smaller players in the agriculture industry needed to be helped too.

""The agriculture industry is already far too concentrated, giving a handful of massive firms a stranglehold on food production. Merging two of the biggest players only makes a bad situation worse,"" Greens spokesman Bart Staes said.

143,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 07:44PM ET</span>","Zuckerberg says Facebook made mistakes on user data, vows curbs","By David Ingram
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday that his company made mistakes in how it handled data belonging to 50 million of its users and promised tougher steps to restrict developers' access to such information.
The world's largest social media network is facing growing government scrutiny in Europe and the United States about a whistleblower's allegations that London-based political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed user information to build profiles on American voters which were later used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016.
Zuckerberg, in his first public comments since the scandal erupted at the weekend, said in a post on Facebook that the company ""made mistakes, there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it."" 
He did not elaborate on what the mistakes were, but he said the social network plans to conduct an investigation of apps on its platform, restrict developer access to data, and give members a tool that lets them more easily disable access to their Facebook data. 
He did not explicitly apologize for the improper use of data, and his plans did not represent a big reduction of advertisers' ability to use Facebook data, which is the company's lifeblood.
Facebook shares pared gains on Wednesday after Zuckerberg's post, closing up 0.7 percent. The company has lost more than $45 billion of its stock market value over the past three days on investor fears that any failure by big tech firms to protect personal data could deter advertisers and users and invite tougher regulation. 
Facebook representatives including Deputy Chief Privacy Officer Rob Sherman met U.S. congressional staff for nearly two hours on Wednesday and planned to continue meetings on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Facebook was unable to answer many questions, two aides who attended the briefing said. 
The whistleblower who launched the scandal, Christopher Wylie, formerly of Cambridge Analytica, said in a tweet that he had accepted invitations to testify before U.S. and UK lawmakers. 
'SCAPEGOAT'
On Tuesday, the board of Cambridge Analytica suspended its Chief Executive Alexander Nix, who was caught in a secret recording boasting that his company played a decisive role in Trump's victory.
But the academic who provided the data disputed that on Wednesday. 
""I think what Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic, and they've made claims that this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you. But I think the reality is it's not that,"" psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, an academic at Cambridge University, told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Wednesday.
Kogan, who gathered the data by running a survey app on Facebook, also said that he was being made a scapegoat by Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Both companies have blamed Kogan for alleged data misuse.
Only 300,000 Facebook users responded to Kogan's quiz, but that gave the researcher access to those people‚Äôs Facebook friends as well, who had not agreed to share information, producing details on 50 million users. 
Facebook has said it subsequently made changes that prevent people from sharing data about friends, and maintains that no data breach occurred because the original users gave permission. Critics say that it essentially was a breach because data of unsuspecting friends was taken.
Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica from using any of Facebook's services on Friday.
Zuckerberg said the company ""will restrict developers' data access even further to prevent other kinds of abuse"" and that the company is working with regulators as they investigate what happened.
Many analysts have now raised concerns that the incident will have a negative impact on user engagement with Facebook, potentially reducing its clout with advertisers. Three Wall Street brokerages cut their price targets.
""Investors now have to consider whether or not the company will conclude that it has grown in a manner that has proven to be untenable or whether it needs to significantly improve how it is managed,"" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.

Facebook shares are down more than 8 percent since Friday. The company has risen more than 550 percent in value in the past five years.

144,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 05:11AM ET</span>",A tale of two hotels: Italy's bad loan sales hang in the balance,"By Valentina Za and Simon Jessop
MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - The Hotel Dei Dogi, a lagoon-side palazzo in Venice, will be renovated in the autumn for the first time in 20 years after a U.S. investment firm snapped up the debts of its family owners, confident of selling it and eight sister hotels at a profit.
In the hinterland a couple of hours' drive to the west, hotel Le Seriole, modest with a small pool and closed, is being auctioned for a fifth time this month; four previous attempts drew no bids - driving the price down by 79 percent.
The two hotels hold clues to Italy's ability to draw a final line under a banking crisis that risked undermining the euro zone at its height and boosted anti-establishment parties in this month's election.
The Dei Dogi is the exception - such high end properties account for just five percent of the problem loan market's annual turnover, two industry sources said. Far more common are businesses like Le Seriole, for which liquidation could be the only option.
But both fall into the more promising half of Europe's biggest bad loan market because their obligations are backed by physical assets.
A buyer can expect to recover at least 50-60 percent of a loan with good collateral such as an apartment in a large city, compared with just 5-6 percent in a corporate bankruptcy with no assets pledged as guarantee, several industry sources said.
Italy's banks have cut their soured debts below 300 billion euros from a peak of 360 billion in 2015-16, starting with batches of unsecured loans that were easier to price.
Regulators, keen to strengthen the lenders and prevent a new financial crisis, are demanding more, and banks, having plowed through reams of messy loan records, last year began to put more valuable secured loans on the block.
They are drawing healthy competition from investors seeking higher returns in a property market that has lagged behind a rebound in other developed countries.
Some buyers see a virtuous circle in which an injection of funds into neglected underlying assets proves a boon to the broader Italian economy. Others fear prices are rising too fast at a time of post-election political uncertainty.
All agree a sense of momentum is key.
""Perceptions and the level of confidence count perhaps even more than actual numbers,"" said Guido Lombardo, chief investment officer at Credito Fondiario, an Italian bank that invests in soured loans and manages them.
""A prospect of stability would really help support expectations of a pick-up in property prices.""
GROWTH CONUNDRUM
Italy's 1.5 percent economic growth last year, the fastest since 2010, helped corporate insolvency rates return to pre-crisis levels. The upturn should also benefit creditors' recovery rates, which generally move inversely to default rates.
""How much and how fast you recover is directly correlated with GDP growth, with a lag of 6-12 months,"" said Andrea Mignanelli, CEO of Italy's second-biggest debt collector, Cerved Credit Management. 
""With the economy on the mend, we're already witnessing improvements: fewer judicial auctions with no bidders, more out-of-court settlements, slightly quicker bankruptcy proceedings.""
The election, however, has cast doubt over Italy's outlook as some economists say only further reforms can lift the growth potential of the euro zone's most sluggish economy.
The reformist center-left government was punished by popular anger at bailouts that shored up the system but hurt thousands of ordinary savers. Now, the two contenders to lead the next executive are the anti-establishment 5-Star and the eurosceptic League, who both have pledged to row back on previous market-friendly measures.
HOPE AND DESPAIR
Betting on Italy's steady tourist flows, Minnesota-based investment firm Varde Partners bought 350 million euros of bank debt owed by hotel chain Boscolo before acquiring nine hotels, including Dei Dogi, from the controlling family last year.
Varde restructured the debt and will invest 80 to 90 million euros in a revamp under new chief executive Stephen Alden, who oversaw the renovation of The Connaught hotel in London.
""The management team will be focused on enhancing the quality of the hotels over the next three to four years,"" said Tim Mooney, a partner and global head of real estate at Varde in London. ""We will then seek to sell the company.""
Despite being a top tourist destination, Italy suffers from outdated infrastructure with thousands of overly-indebted, family-owned hotels lacking the cash to invest in the business.
Stuck in the countryside outside Mantua, hotel Le Seriole was financed by bailed-out lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MI:BMPS), which is offloading 24 billion euros in bad debts.
Provided the loans are cheap enough, funds can still reap the double-digit returns their investors normally demand even if a property sells for less than the value of the land it is on.
""There are really good returns to be made if you know how to price your assets well,"" said Pier Paolo Masenza, a partner at consultancy PwC in Milan.
Selling prices have risen, by 10 percent in 18 months according to one industry source. But despite this, and years of costly writedowns by banks, a gap remains between balance-sheet values and how much investors are willing to pay.
Italy's slow-moving judicial system is partly to blame; data firm DATASINC calculates foreclosures and insolvency procedures take on average 4.4 years, increasing risks and costs.
Three industry sources said investors can expect to recoup on average 30-35 percent of a loan's nominal value. But servicing costs shave up to 10 percent off recovery rates and legal costs take off another 5-6 percent.
Returns are still attractive considering Italian soured loans fetched on average 18 percent of their face value last year, Italian bad loan specialist Banca IFIS (MI:IF) calculated. 
That compares with an average book value of 35.6 percent for the worst kind of soured loans, which total 166.5 billion euros before writedowns according to the central bank. 
Several sources said up to two thirds of a further 112 billion euros in 'unlikely to pay' UTP loans valued by banks at around 66 percent of their face value would have to be classed as insolvent and heavily written down to facilitate disposals.
This is either because borrowers are effectively beyond redemption or because the loans' small size makes them unsuitable for restructuring.
HEATING UP
With some investors saying Italian bad loan portfolios on sale can easily attract two dozen bids, banks can hope rising competition among investors will help stem future loan losses.
Early market entrants, big private investment firms such as Cerberus or Fortress, have been joined by niche buyers like London-based Algebris, which targets corporate bad loans backed by high-quality properties, mainly in northern Italy.
There are also more buyers funding purchases from bank deposits and happy with lower returns than traditional funds.
A well-oiled market would help Italian banks deal with new European rules which will give lenders only up to eight years to write off new loans turning sour to avoid build-ups.
But a top investor and a debt collection specialist both said they were concerned about how much further prices could rise before endangering returns, as their loans were performing in line with projections rather than outperforming.
""That means the prices paid for those portfolios were broadly right. Yet prices keep rising ... we're nearing levels where someone may start getting hurt,"" one person said.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 04:02AM ET</span>",Global fund managers eye trillion dollar pension business in China,"By Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Global asset managers are lobbying Beijing to offer tax benefits and other incentives to entice China's aging population to invest in mutual funds for their retirement, as funds eye a multi-trillion dollar opportunity in commercial pensions.
Their hopes for a bigger role in China's pension market and its reform process received a boost this month when regulators published guidelines for the introduction of Western-style pension target funds.
Although such fund-of-fund (FoF) pension products are popular in mature markets like the United States, they will have a hard time getting off the ground in China without supportive policies that are now lacking, such as preferable tax treatment, fund managers say.
""The guideline is a very important piece of China's entire pension reform jigsaw ... but tax benefits - another eagerly anticipated reform measure - have not come out yet,"" said Calvin Chiu, Asia head of pension development at Manulife (TO:MFC), the Canadian financial services group. 
Manulife is sharing its expertise with Chinese regulators through a pension committee under the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), hoping that the government will eventually grant tax benefits to a broad range of investment products, Chiu said. 
But he conceded that desired policy changes could be slow, as China's pension reform involves coordination between several government agencies.
Nevertheless, fund managers are racing to be the first to roll out pension target funds in China. They include the Chinese mutual fund ventures of Manulife, Blackrock (NYSE:BLK),  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Eurizon Capital SGR. 
PENSION REFORM 
Unlike in markets such as the United States, where the burden of social security is shared between the government, employers and individuals in a three-pillar system, China's pension coverage is heavily reliant on state funding.
To meet the challenges of a rapidly-aging population, Beijing kicked off a program in February to build a commercial private pension market that gives individuals more responsibility for their old-age protection, though it has not announced a timeframe for implementation. 
""The commercial pension business will be a huge opportunity for asset managers,"" said Ivan Shi, head of research at Z-Ben Advisors, predicting the business could account for 40 percent of China's total mutual fund assets in 10 years, reaching $4.8 trillion.
Such optimism sounds outlandish for a market that has not yet taken root, but is not baseless.
In the U.S. pension market, 48 percent of assets in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), or $4.1 trillion, was invested in mutual funds in 2017, according to the Investment Company Institute (ICI).
PLENTY OF HURDLES 
But obstacles abound.
Mutual fund managers are competing for a place in China's commercial pension program with insurers, who are also lobbying for tax benefits.
""It remains to be seen how the commercial pension program will be designed ... and which kinds of financial institutions can participate,"" Shi said.
Another daunting challenge is the need to build a new distribution channel, and educate China's often fickle fund investors on the need for retirement planning.
Ren Cheng, founder of Fidelity Freedom Funds, and nicknamed father of target date funds (TDF) - the popular pension tool in the United States - said the right policies are key to underpinning investments that could span over decades.
""It's a huge, huge mistake to treat retirement protection as an investment issue,"" the Boston-based senior consultant at Fidelity Investments said during a recent trip to China, where he advises securities regulators on pension market development.
""Rather, it's about setting up a legal framework and mechanism to address weakness in human nature, such as inertia, and short-sightedness,"" he said, adding that trial and error in the U.S. pension system - now probably the world's best - had many lessons to offer China.
Ren attributed success in the U.S. of the employer-sponsored pension plan 401(K) partly to a government-backed default investment mechanism that enables automatic enrollment, and protects employers from fiduciary liability in case of investment loss. 
""Without the right system, money doesn't stay long. China's financial market is flush with liquidity, but where is the system (to make it stay)?""
The CSRC's chief accountant Jia Wenqin told local media earlier this month that China should explore applying a default investment mechanism, as well as tax benefits, to pension products.
Fidelity International, which doesn't yet have a mutual fund license in China, is angling for a seat at the table.
""For us, our ultimate goal is to participate in the pension market in China,"" Fidelity's China Country Head Jackson Lee said, adding that in the short term, its main focus in China is investor education.

""By sharing our experience and insights on global pension market, we are eager to be an active player in the journey of pension reform in China.""

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese carmaker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (HK:0175), whose chairman recently took a $9 billion stake in Germany's  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn), said on Wednesday its profits more than doubled in 2017, driven by strong domestic sales of popular SUVs.
The automaker, based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, said in a stock exchange filing that 2017 net profit rose 108 percent to 10.6 billion yuan ($1.7 billion) from 5.1 billion yuan in 2016, slightly beating a forecast of 10 billion yuan from analysts polled by Reuters. 
Geely, which is making waves globally after a series of high-profile deals by its parent, saw revenue rise 73 percent to 92.8 billion yuan from a year earlier, far outpacing tepid growth in the wider Chinese vehicle market.
Geely Chairman Li Shufu has been making a major global push. He owns Volvo Cars and has built up stakes in truckmaker AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb), Malaysian automaker Proton, flying car start-up Terrafugia and the maker of London's iconic black cabs.
The Daimler deal, which makes Li the largest shareholder in the owner of Mercedes-Benz, is part of an effort to strengthen Geely's technological muscle amid a shake-up of the global auto market by autonomous driving, electric vehicles and car-sharing.
Geely said in the filing that ""numerous acquisitions"" over the past few years by its parent group should provide ""substantial opportunities for technologies and cost sharing, economies of scales and new market penetration.""
Li, sometimes compared to U.S. auto icon Henry Ford, founded unlisted parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 1986, which was at the time focused on refrigerators. He moved into motorbike manufacturing in the 1990s before switching to cars in 1997.
The firm forecast vehicle sales of 1.58 million units this year, up 27 percent from 1.25 million vehicles in 2017. This would mark a slowdown from 63 percent growth last year. Geely's export volume, however, dropped 46 percent last year.
China's auto market is facing a broad slowdown, in part due to the withdrawal of subsidies for certain more fuel efficient cars. Vehicle sales for the first two months of the year rose 1.7 percent. Competition is also rising as firms race to meet tough new quotas for fully electric and plug-in hybrids cars.
""Competition in the China market should continue to intensify,"" Geely said in the earning report, adding China was becoming the ""world's most competitive vehicle market"".

150,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 04:52PM ET</span>",Starbucks' mobile order push meets resistance from ritual seekers,"By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) wants more people to use its time-saving mobile ordering app that lets customers buy drinks without waiting in line. 
Interviews with more than two dozen Starbucks customers suggest that the move, aimed at countering robust competition from fast-food chains and other coffee sellers, may face obstacles.
To start, saving time was not high on some customers' wish lists. In fact, several said they deliberately slow down their Starbucks visits to indulge in mini catch-up sessions with the ""baristas"" who take orders and make lattes. 
Such comments highlight Starbucks' cultural conundrum: How can the company meet the demands of tech-savvy, time-crunched customers as well as growth-hungry investors without turning into a commodity fast-food chain? 
""I don't mind standing in line. I like to chat with the baristas,"" said Los Angeles business consultant John Mishler, 30, who began using Starbucks' mobile order app shortly after it launched nationally in September 2015. 
He visits a Starbucks virtually every day, but only uses the service roughly once every three weeks.
""I have an excuse to be doing nothing,"" Mishler said, referring to his wait in line. ""It's part of my morning routine and I don't want to change it.""
""If my life is so complicated that I can't wait 5 minutes for a cup of coffee, I have to realign my priorities,"" said San Francisco Bay Area marketing consultant Diane Schreiber, 49.
Kevin Johnson, who succeeded Starbucks' co-founder Howard Schultz as chief executive in April last year, told shareholders on Wednesday that Starbucks can satisfy both rushing customers and those who prefer to take it easy. 
""Some in the industry believe that you must either focus on a retail experience that is about community or a retail experience that is about convenience, you cannot do both,"" he said at the company's annual meeting in Seattle. ""We do not buy into the false trade off."" 
Shortly after launching the mobile-ordering service, Starbucks suffered a fiasco - bottlenecks at locations where baristas were not prepared for the crush of orders. Baristas worked through the issues, and by the end of 2017 mobile orders accounted for 11 percent of Starbucks' U.S. transactions. Now, the company wants to offer mobile orderings, previously available only to members of its loyalty program, to all customers. 
Its journey is instructive for other restaurants, including McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and Dunkin' Donuts (O:DNKN), which followed Starbucks into mobile ordering. 
Such services might help companies save money by automating tasks. On the other hand, some customers say they can put spending on autopilot - a potentially expensive proposition when Starbucks medium ""grande"" lattes cost around $5 each. 
Molly Harper, 26, stopped using Starbucks mobile order after it became a burden on her wallet. 
""Your money runs out pretty fast,"" said Harper, a Los Angeles restaurant server and self-described coffee lover. She was spending about $40 a week on mobile order and has cut way back since dropping it. 
All of the customers interviewed by Reuters appreciated the appeal of faster service, and some prefer it. 
Alex Vorro, 37, who works in downtown Chicago, is satisfied with mobile ordering - except when beverages take significantly longer than the app estimates or he gets the wrong drink because of a mix-up with someone with the same name.
Washington, D.C., economist Preston Motes, 49, visits Starbucks weekly, pays with its app but doesn't use mobile order because he finds it ""irritating."" 
His beef? Mobile orders go into the queue as soon as they are placed, allowing users to skip ahead of the people who are waiting in line. 
""I'm always wondering why my drink takes longer when there's no one in line and it's because of the mobile orders,"" Motes said. 
That is not lost on Robert Street, 33, a former Starbucks barista who is still in the habit of watching customers. 
Street sends his mobile order to Starbucks through Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Alexa every morning as he is leaving for work at a private high school in Houston. 
Breezing past the line in the store to grab his beverage waiting on the counter, ""I selfishly feel like I won the system and saved a bunch of time,"" Street said. 
Then, he notices the people in line. 
""I always feel like a criminal,"" said Street, who admits that he still feels like he is pilfering a drink he already paid for. 

He's heard waiting customers ask baristas what he is doing and wants them to know that he is not Instagram's @thisisnotmycoffee - a ""Bandit"" who rates stolen Starbucks mobile order drinks. When reached by Reuters, @thisisnotmycoffee declined comment.

154,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 01:21AM ET</span>","In search of higher margins, Canada Goose to make more of its own luxury coats","By Nichola Saminather
(Reuters) - Luxury coat maker Canada Goose plans to bring more manufacturing in-house in a bid to boost margins and help it live up to lofty investor expectations as the most expensive stock among major luxury brands. 
The Toronto-based company aims to make a least half of its outerwear itself in a few years, up from about a third now, Chief Executive Officer Dani Reiss told Reuters in an interview at the company's Toronto headquarters. 
""We'd like to grow our internal capacity,"" Reiss said, referring to the move as one of its ""pillars of growth.""
""Here's an opportunity for us to have more in-house capacity and increase our profit margins, which is important for our investors and for us,"" he said. 
By tightening their hold on manufacturing, luxury outerwear makers such as Canada Goose and Italian rival Moncler as well as Kering's Italian fashion label Gucci are able to increase control over quality to justify charging eye-watering prices.
""If you‚Äôve got a multi-tier supply chain, you‚Äôre leaving profit margin throughout every element of the supply chain for everybody along the way,"" said Rod Sides, Deloitte's U.S. retail and distribution leader. 
Companies still have to be able to predict future demand accurately for the strategy to succeed, and other factors, like the location of new facilities, can make a difference.
For instance, putting new facilities in Canada Goose's home province, Ontario - which has the highest electricity rates in Canada and raised the minimum wage 21 percent this year - would likely not help the bottom line, said Brian Madden, portfolio manager at Goodreid Investment Counsel. 
But the risk is worth it for Canada Goose, which has all of its coats made in Canada and sells them for between $725 and $1,695. The company posted December quarter operating margins of 60 percent on online and own-store sales versus 43 percent from wholesale, causing investors to cheer the growth in its direct-to-consumer business. 
(For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2GBRFNK)
The stock has almost doubled since it listed a year ago, vastly outperforming the flat Toronto stock benchmark, and is trading at 55 times forward earnings, more than double Moncler's.
Canada Goose, which opened the first of its own stores in 2016, plans to have as many as 20 by the end of 2020 from six now, compared with Moncler's 201 stores.
""At this point they're relatively under-penetrated across their ultimate audience, and they're going to grow into that,"" said Nomura equity analyst Simeon Siegel. 
Despite Siegel's positive view, he has a neutral rating because of its valuation.
As it expands its footprint, and starts selling online in China and possibly Russia beyond that, Reiss said the company needs to ensure it can keep up with demand. 
GRIP ON QUALITY
For many luxury companies, having a tight grip on quality for big ticket items is often crucial to convince customers to fork out small fortunes. Most luxury companies would also rather sell out temporarily at full price than produce too much and have to discount merchandise. 
Moncler took control of its own jacket manufacturing site in Romania and slightly reduced the number of its suppliers in 2016. Most of its manufacturing and supply chain remains outsourced, though it declined to detail how much. 
Kering's Gucci is also looking to bring more of its handbag production in-house this year with a new facility near Florence.
Though operating in a different sphere, France's Hermes, best-known for its $10,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags, makes all its leather goods at its own domestic workshops. 
But outsourcing can also make sense, especially for basic items like T-shirts, if there are compelling cost reasons, or if expertise lies elsewhere. 
Canada Goose has no plans to change suppliers for its knitwear lines from Italy and Romania, nor the exclusive external suppliers for its coats' components, according to the company.
It has six factories that make its outwear in Canada, and has lifted manufacturing capacity by building new sites, acquiring contractors and adding employees. 

""What this offers is more control on the quality and timing and product,"" said luxury consultant Robert Burke, who has counted Canada Goose among his clients. ""The risk is to ensure you buy (a facility) that's big enough for future growth but not cumbersome.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A former World Trade Organization economist picked to lead NAFTA negotiations by the front-runner in the race for Mexico's presidency told Reuters on Tuesday that modernizing parts of the pact should be possible while stressing the importance of relations with the United States.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a leftist who leads most polls ahead of Mexico's July 1 election, said on Tuesday that if he is elected he would put Jesus Seade in charge of steering talks with the United States and Canada to revamp the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. 
Speaking by phone with Reuters, Seade voiced optimism, though he noted that he had not begun work on the issue. 
""The economic relationship with the United States is super important,"" he said. ""It stands to reason to think that 25 years after the negotiation has been concluded there would be issues and areas where updating may be possible and in the interest of the three countries."" 
Mexico depends heavily on trade with the United States, which receives about 80 percent of its exports.
The Mexican economy was plunged into uncertainty after the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has vowed to leave NAFTA if he cannot secure better terms.
Although he has been critical of NAFTA, Lopez Obrador now says he wants to preserve the pact.
Seade, who is associate vice president for global affairs at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shenzhen, described himself as a longtime supporter of Lopez Obrador's. 
He said he is eager to return to public service, having served as Mexico's trade ambassador in negotiations to found the WTO, where he formerly served as deputy director-general. 
""To me, there is no higher honor than serving your country,"" he said. ""I think there is something I can do, and I will be delighted to.""
Although he said he has met Lopez Obrador just once, Seade has close ties to the candidate's economic team, including proposed finance minister Carlos Urzua and would-be economy minister Graciela Marquez.
""These are people that I know well and respect,"" he said. 
Seade also brings ties to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, whose family controls telecommunications firm America Movil. Seade said his sister married one of Slim's older brothers. 
""I've never worked with him -- I know him socially,"" Seade said of Slim, noting he hadn't seen him in 10 or 15 years. 

In a video announcing Seade's appointment, Lopez Obrador mistakenly gave the economist's name as ""Seade Helu."" Helu is Slim's second last name.

SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON (Reuters) - Shareholders of electric car company Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc approved a compensation package potentially worth $2.6 billion for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk on Wednesday, though by a lower margin than U.S. CEOs typically receive on pay votes.
Excluding votes by Musk and his brother Kimbal, the measure passed with about 73 percent of votes cast. Including the Musk votes, the award passed with about 80 percent support, Tesla said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
The compensation award includes no salary or cash bonus for the Silicon Valley billionaire, but sets rewards based on Tesla's market value rising to as much as $650 billion over the next 10 years. 
The vote result indicated some, but not all big investors were prepared to support a large payout at the founder-led company. If achieved, the award surpasses anything previously granted to top U.S. executives, according to proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, which had recommended votes against the compensation. 
Musk could own as much as $55.8 billion in Tesla stock and more than a quarter of the electric car company in the next decade if he hits all targets of the new plan.
""At $2.6 billion, the grant value is unprecedented and sets the new high-water mark for an individual executive equity award at a U.S. public company,"" ISS wrote last month. ISS said it valued the award even higher, at $3.7 billion.
Shares of Tesla are down 18 percent from a year high reached in September. The company has faced pressure on multiple fronts, from a cash crunch and production delays to increasing competition from rivals. Some investors are concerned that Musk is distracted by too many projects including his SpaceX rocket launches.
Compensation for the CEOs of large U.S. companies is typically approved by around 95 percent of votes cast in annual ""say on pay"" advisory votes. Musk's potentially huge payout meant extra scrutiny. The vote total was 63,014,339 ""for"" votes and 23,407,632 against.
John Trentacoste, partner at pay consultant Farient Advisors, said the 73 percent support level shows ""there is support, but skepticism"" among investors for Musk's pay plan.
Noting the 95 percent typical support level for CEO pay, he said Musk's big payout has been roundly criticized. Ultimately the result, he said, ""is not great comparatively, but for the amount of fodder that's been around on this pay plan, I think it could be worse.""
Ahead of the vote tally, compensation consultant Brent Longnecker said any result above 70 percent would prompt Tesla to ""breathe a sigh of relief.""
SOME OPPOSITION 
Before Tesla began a special shareholder meeting on Wednesday, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price Group, Tesla's fourth-largest investor with about 6 percent of its shares, told Reuters Musk's pay plan ""is well aligned with shareholders' long-term interests."" But a smaller investor, the California State Teachers' Retirement System (CalSTRS), said it planned to vote no.
CalSTRS is one of the nation's largest public pension plans but only the 59th largest investor in Tesla, with a 0.13 percent stake.
""Given the size of the award, we believe the potential dilution to shareholders is just too great. In addition, we have concerns about the lack of focus on profitability for the company, and the one profitability metric that is used excludes the cost of stock-based compensation,"" CalSTRS' Director of Corporate Governance, Anne Sheehan, said in a statement.
Under the proposed award, which involves stock options that vest in 12 tranches, Tesla's market value must increase to $100 billion for the first tranche to vest and rise in additional $50 billion increments for the remainder.
Tesla was valued at about $53.47 billion at Wednesday's close, according to Thomson Reuters data. Its shares had fallen nearly 12 percent since the pay plan was announced, but rose 2 percent on Wednesday to close at $316.53.
Tesla has been struggling to manufacture its Model 3 sedan - for which it holds about 500,000 advance reservations - and has repeatedly pushed back production timelines. 
The company has been burning through cash and expects spending to rise this year, even as a host of upcoming projects demand attention and capital, including the new Tesla Semi and the Model Y crossover.

A wave of electric vehicles on the horizon from rivals are also adding pressure. Global automakers from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co to Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) are cumulatively investing $90 billion in electrification over the next five years, with luxury models from Audi and Tata Motors Ltd's Jaguar due this summer.

157,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 03:18AM ET</span>",Australian inquiry turns up heat on Westpac's car-finance unit,"By Jonathan Barrett and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Westpac Banking Corp's (AX:WBC) auto-finance business approved applications that contained no expense information, and relied heavily on the advice of car-yard managers when processing loans, an inquiry into Australia's financial sector heard on Wednesday. 
In Australia, 90 percent of car sales are arranged through finance organized by dealerships and lenders, according to the inquiry, with new finance commitments for vehicles last year totaling A$35.7 billion ($27.5 billion).
The sector, dominated by Westpac,  Macquarie Group  (AX:MQG) and a range of specialist lenders such as Toyota Financial Services, has been singled out by the inquiry, which can recommend criminal or civil prosecutions and legislative changes.
The Royal Commission turned its attention to Westpac for the first time on Wednesday, using the experience of customer Nalini Thiruvangadam to show how some customers were mis-sold car loans they could never hope to repay.
In emotional testimony, Thiruvangadam said she signed documents at a car yard in 2012 that compelled her to pay almost A$260 a fortnight for what she later found out was a ""demo car that jerked a lot"".
Thiruvangadam, who was earning A$350 per fortnight at the time plus government benefits, said she fell behind on rent payments and other bills and was subjected to threats by a Westpac-owned subsidiary of having her car towed should she not pay out the loan in full.
Westpac general manager, specialist finance, Phillip Godkin said under questioning on Wednesday that the bank had not taken reasonable steps to verify the customer's finances, which included accepting an application with no expenses details, and that ""we shouldn't have made this loan"".
Godkin said Westpac relied on car-yard business managers to verify a customer's financial position.
Westpac compensated Thiruvangadam in 2017.
Albert Dinelli, counsel assisting the commission, said Thiruvangadam's experience was a case study of issues arising when some customers transact with auto-finance lenders.
The examination of lending practices at the country's second-biggest bank by market size follows scrutiny of rivals Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ) and National Australia Bank (AX:NAB) during the opening week-and-a-half of hearings.
The Royal Commision has found widespread evidence of financial product mis-selling, poorly-arranged incentive payments, and fraud.
On Wednesday, the inquiry also heard Westpac was paying so-called ""flex commissions"" to dealerships, which earn larger commissions when they sign customers to higher interest loans.
The flex amount is the difference between the base rate set by the lender and the rate the dealer sells to the consumer.
Customers are not told about the payments even though they increase the cost of their loans, Godkin said. 
Such commissions will be prohibited from November under new laws, after the corporate regulator found that consumers were paying excessive rates on car loans. 
Last year, Australia's corporate regulator sued Westpac for allegedly breaching so-called responsible lending laws by selling interest-only mortgages to people who could not afford to repay them.
Westpac is defending the claims in court, which will hold hearings in September.

159,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 06:20AM ET</span>","Equities, dollar slip as Fed rate path jitters build","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares were flat on Wednesday and the dollar eased off three-week highs as investors marked time before a likely hike in U.S. interest rates and awaited guidance on how many more to expect for this year.
Markets are on edge, not only because of the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting which should deliver the first rate rise of 2018, but also because of a selloff in U.S. tech shares, which has wiped almost $50 billion off the value of Facebook (O:FB) this week amid uproar over the alleged misuse of users' data.
The Facebook losses have filtered through other tech shares in the United States and overseas, with shares in Twitter (N:TWTR) falling more than 10 percent on Tuesday (SPX).
The losses are likely to have hit investors hard, with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's monthly survey showing global funds heavily positioned in tech shares just before the rout began. 
""There are tensions between potential bad news and good news in the market. The bad news is the problem facing the tech sector, which has been the leading light of U.S. and Asian equity markets for over a year,"" said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
""The good news is we must recall why the Fed is tightening policy. It's because of the underlying strength of the U.S. and global economy.""
MSCI's all-country equity index flatlined <>MIWD00000PUS>, and is now 6 percent off record highs hit at the end of January, pressured by fears of a global trade war ignited by U.S. President Donald Trump and the possibility that the Fed could end up raising interest rates more than three times this year.
The Fed has increased borrowing costs five times since it began tightening policy in late 2015. Markets are pricing in three rises this year but some reckon policymakers could squeeze in a fourth, which might trigger a bond and equity selloff.
The 1800 GMT announcement will also be the first under new Fed chair Jerome Powell, analysts note.
""We might have significant changes in communication compared with what we've seen under (previous chair Janet) Yellen,"" said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
""The economic situation post tax cuts also justifies a significant shift upwards in the dot plot,"" he added, referring to fears the Fed's de facto policy forecast chart could signal four rate rises rather than three, due to the economic boost delivered by Trump's tax reforms.
Those expectations had sent the dollar to nearly three-week highs on Tuesday but it eased back a quarter percent against a basket of currencies (DXY) on Wednesday, having lost almost half a percent this month.
(For a graphic on Developed market currencies against the Dollar click http://reut.rs/2FYAg0X)
The greenback's weakness -- it fell 10 percent last year -- is at least partly down to U.S. capital seeking to invest overseas amid robust world growth. Milligan said that would continue unless trade skirmishes started impacting the world economy or U.S. growth accelerated further.
""To get the dollar higher we will need combination of the Fed being more aggressive and signaling more changes for 2019,"" he added.
European shares edged down, despite a small tech index bounce off two-week lows (SX8P) and equity futures signaled that Wall Street would likewise open a touch lower (ESC1)
Emerging equities fell 0.2 percent (MSCIEF)
TRADE WAR FEARS
A major overhang for financial markets is the specter of a global trade war. 
Trump is expected to unveil up to $60 billion in import duties on Chinese goods by Friday, after imposing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum earlier this month. 
Investors are worried his actions could escalate into a full-blown trade war if China and other countries retaliate with similar or harsher measures, threatening global growth. 
This week's meeting of finance ministers and central banks of the world's 20 biggest economies failed to diffuse tensions, with the so-called G20 bloc saying only it ""recognised"" the need for more ""dialogue and actions"". 
The currencies of export-heavy nations such as the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars were on the defensive after being knocked down to multi-month lows, while most emerging currencies were also marked lower.
The Aussie  languished near three-month troughs against the dollar of $0.7679 while the Kiwi  hit the lowest since early January. The Canadian dollar  held at $1.3029 after hitting $1.3124 on Monday, a low not seen since mid-2017.
The Mexican peso was up almost 1 percent against the dollar after reports the United States had dropped a demand that vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico should contain 50 percent U.S. content.
Fears of a trade war have also weighed on commodity prices, though tensions in the Middle East supported oil, lifting Brent futures (LCOc1) almost half a percent.

Copper prices in Shanghai fell to their lowest in almost six month, their fourth straight day of losses .

160,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 08:30PM ET</span>",The Cost of Noble's Restructuring Is Likely to Top $100 Million,"(Bloomberg) -- The cost of Noble Group Ltd.‚Äôs restructuring is likely to top $100 million, another financial burden for the cash-strapped commodities trader that has defaulted on its bonds.
The estimated price tag for advisers and other expenses, based on disclosures in regulatory filings, is approaching the company‚Äôs entire market value of $114 million as Noble pays fees to the company‚Äôs creditors and foots much of the bill for the 11 law firms, investment banks and public relations consultants working on the restructuring.
Despite having defaulted on its debt this week, Noble has agreed to pay some of the multi-million dollar fees by today as part of a binding deal with a group of senior creditors.
The company declined to comment.
In the deal, published last week, Noble agreed that it was now ""responsible for paying all costs and expenses"" incurred by the ad-hoc committee of creditors, which includes hedge funds such as Och Ziff Capital Management LLC and Davidson Kempner Capital Management LLC, plus the two banks supporting the deal --  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and ING Bank NV. In addition, the trader will also pay the costs and expenses incurred by its own senior management negotiating their own deal within the restructuring.
Trade Finance
According to the agreement, Noble has to pay a chunk of the fees by today. On March 14 it agreed to ""pay all outstanding invoices"" incurred by the advisers working on behalf of its senior creditors and banks providing trade finance ""within five business days.""
Noble hasn‚Äôt disclosed the total amount in fees covered by the agreement and a spokesperson declined to comment. All the company has said is that its ""restructuring costs and expenses"" would be ""in-line"" with the ""business separation and disposal costs and expenses"" it incurred last year. Noble declined to say how much it spent on those items in 2017.
The advisers‚Äô fees come on top of several other payments that Noble has publicly disclosed in its debt-restructuring deal.
First, the trader has agreed to pay the members of the ad-hoc creditors committee the equivalent to 2 percent of the face value of the debt they hold, with a cap on $2 billion in debt, to compensate them for their work on the restructuring, according to a regulatory filling in January. Based on the company‚Äôs latest disclosure that the ad-hoc group holds 46 percent of its debt, that bill would equal $31.7 million. If the creditors increase their debt holdings to the cap, the bill would rise to $40 million.
Credit Lines
Second, Noble has also agreed to pay ING a total of $15 million in fees for signing the restructuring deal and for not withdrawing an existing credit line. (As of last week‚Äôs announcement, ING hadn‚Äôt yet signed the restructuring agreement.) And thirdly, Deutsche Bank and other senior creditors will receive up to $35 million for providing another credit line that will keep the company running after the restructuring.
The total sum comprising fees and expenses publicly disclosed is now in excess of $80 million, and could reach $90 million, making it likely that the total bill for the restructuring will come in around $100 million or more.
That calculation doesn‚Äôt include any retention bonuses that Noble Group has paid to senior staff to avoid mass walk-outs during the debt restructuring talks. Last year, Noble paid $20 million to its senior energy traders to keep them working for a few extra months while it was trying to sell its oil trading unit, the company said in a regulatory filling last week.
The advisers involved in the restructuring deal include Moelis & Co., PJT Partners Ltd., Comprador Ltd., Houlihan Lokey Inc. and Rothschild & Cie., according to regulatory filings. Law firms on the deal include Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP, Allen & Overy LLP, Clifford Chance LLP, and White & Case LLP. The public relations firm RLM Finsbury LLC is also advising the company on its debt restructuring.

161,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2018 08:26AM ET</span>",EU proposes online turnover tax for big tech firms,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed rules on Wednesday to make digital companies pay their fair share of tax, with U.S. tech giants such as Google (O:GOOGL), Facebook (O:FB) and Amazon (O:AMZN) set to foot a large chunk of the bill.
Under the Commission's plan, companies with significant digital revenues in Europe will pay a 3 percent tax on their turnover on various online services in the European Union, bringing in an estimated 5 billion euros ($6.1 billion).
If backed by EU states and lawmakers, whose support is far from certain, the tax would apply to large firms with annual worldwide revenue above 750 million euros ($920.9 million) annual ""taxable"" EU revenues above 50 million euros.
The tax, designed as a short-term measure before the EU finds a way to tax profits based on where they do business, could also encompass other high-profile U.S. firms such as Airbnb and Uber [UBER.UL].
It is designed to apply to activities in which users play a role in value creation - whether via online advertising, such as in search engines or social media, via online trading or in the sale of data about users.
The legislation comes as the United States unsettles Europe with its own tax reform and the threat of a trade war along with reports that Facebook user data was accessed by a consultancy to help President Donald Trump win the 2016 election.
EU antitrust authorities have also been busy investigating the business practices of Amazon, Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), leading to accusations, which the Commission denies, that it is targeting Silicon Valley.
DEEP DIVISIONS
The Commission said that top digital firms, whose average revenue growth of 14 percent far exceeded that of other multinationals, faced an effective tax rate of 9.5 percent, less than half the level of traditional companies.
The proposals require backing from the European Parliament and the 28 EU countries, but they are divided on the issue. EU tax reforms need the backing of all member states to become law.
Large EU states have accused the tech firms of paying too little tax in the bloc by routing some of their profits to low-tax member states such as Ireland and Luxembourg.
U.S. tech companies themselves have said they are paying tax in line with national and international laws and, in some cases, that the tax should be paid in the United States on profits repatriated there. 
The proposal is to tax companies according to where their digital users are based.
A senior EU diplomatic predicted it would be hard to push through the legislation, among the most important for the bloc, because of deep divisions between larger countries set to gain more tax income and smaller ones set to lose.
Smaller countries also fear becoming less attractive to multinational firms.
Ireland has warned that the proposals risk merely re-slicing the tax cake, rather than actually taxing more. Some countries also believe that smaller companies should also face a bill.
Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said that the EU would prefer globally agreed rules, but that the amount of profits currently going untaxed was unacceptable. 
The tax would to apply to online advertising sales, which would bring in companies such as Google and Facebook, to platforms offering services such as interaction with other users or online sales and to those selling data generated from users.
The tax would be collected in countries where the users are located.
Tech industry groups have complained that it is wrong to tax revenues as that would unduly hit companies, such as Amazon, with thinner margins.

162,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 09:02PM ET</span>","Trump, deemed 'not above the law,' faces legal storm","By Jonathan Stempel and Nathan Layne
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump faced legal challenges from women on two fronts on Tuesday as a defamation lawsuit brought by a former Apprentice TV show contestant moved forward and a former Playboy model who said she had an affair with Trump sued to undo a confidentiality agreement. 
The developments increased legal pressure on Trump, who during and after the 2016 presidential campaign was accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women, allegations he denied. 
A New York state judge on Tuesday denied a bid by Trump to toss a defamation lawsuit by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on NBC's ""The Apprentice"", raising the prospect that he might have to answer questions about his behavior in court. 
Justice Jennifer Schecter in Manhattan rejected Trump's claim that he was immune from being sued, finding ""absolutely no authority"" to dismiss litigation related ""purely to unofficial conduct"" solely because he occupied the White House.
""No one is above the law,"" the judge wrote in her ruling.
Playboy model Karen McDougal sued a media company that she said paid her $150,000 to keep quiet about an affair that she said she had with Trump. 
The lawsuit was the second time this month that a woman challenged legal arrangements to prevent discussions about affairs women said they had with Trump. Both involved payments that legal experts have said could equate to in-kind contributions to Trump's campaign in violation of federal election laws.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump has denied all accusations of misconduct, and called his accusers ""liars.""
Zervos met Trump when she became a contestant on ""The Apprentice"" in 2005. She said Trump kissed her against her will at a 2007 meeting in his New York office, and later groped her in a Beverly Hills hotel at a meeting about a possible job.
Zervos said Trump's denials amounted to defamation and that being branded a ""liar"" caused diners to stay away from her restaurant in California.
John Diamond, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, said Trump would have to testify under oath if he has to defend himself.
McDougal filed her lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against American Media Inc, publisher of the National Enquirer, whose head, David Pecker, has described Trump as a ""personal friend.""
McDougal said American Media paid her $150,000 in 2016 for the rights to her story that she had an affair with Trump in 2006 and 2007 and then never published it. 
McDougal said her lawyer at the time, Keith Davidson, secretly negotiated with Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer, and that Cohen was in consultations with American Media on the agreement. Cohen has acknowledged arranging to pay to silence another woman, porn star Stormy Daniels. That payment was also made during the election campaign.
Davidson said on Tuesday that he never had contact with Cohen during the McDougal negotiations.
""False allegations have been levied against me and I look forward to responding to them in an appropriate forum,"" he told Reuters.
McDougal is asking the court to declare the agreement null and void. She said she was tricked into signing it, that it was intended to illegally influence the election and because it violates public policy against using threats of legal action to get someone to stay silent on issues of public concern.
She also called the agreement an illegal donation from AMI to the Trump campaign in violation of federal election law.
American Media said in a statement the company has a valid contract with McDougal and looks forward to reaching an amicable resolution. It said she has been free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with Trump since 2016 and that the suggestion that American Media silenced her is without merit.
Davidson declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment.

Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued the president on March 6, stating Trump never signed an agreement for her to keep quiet about an ""intimate"" relationship between them. Daniels received $130,000 under that agreement.

163,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 07:30PM ET</span>",How Fletcher Building bungled a New Zealand construction boom,"By Tom Westbrook and Charlotte Greenfield
SYDNEY/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Cantilevered over the art-deco facade of an old bra factory in Auckland's city center is a half-built steel-and-concrete structure that is one of New Zealand's largest commercial building projects - and Fletcher Building Ltd's (NZ:FBU) biggest problem.
Fletcher agreed to design and build the New Zealand International Convention Centre for a fixed price of NZ$477 million ($349 million) in 2015 and promised to pay late fees if the project wasn't completed on time, a source familiar with the deal says. 
Now six months behind schedule according to owner Skycity Entertainment Group Ltd (NZ:SKC), Fletcher - which said it cannot disclose contract terms including the exact price - is expecting to wear a NZ$410 million loss on the project. 
The Convention Centre project illustrates how New Zealand's largest construction company turned a once-in-a-generation building boom into a near disaster, wiping out billions in shareholder value and costing its chief executive and chairman their jobs. 
Just a few years ago, things could hardly have looked better for the 103-year-old cement-to-construction conglomerate. A surge in immigration and investment was coinciding with the need for a massive rebuild after two devastating earthquakes in the South Island.
But as contracts for major projects rolled in, rivals said they watched incredulous as Fletcher lobbed unbeatably low bids, promising to wear the risk of rising costs with fixed prices as well as offering to pay fees for missing ambitious timelines.
""They raced to the bottom in terms of pricing - everyone else was screaming about it,"" said a rival industry player, who declined to be named speaking about a firm that dominates the sector.
In response, Fletcher said it would not comment on the views of others and had provided ""significant detail on the causes of the losses"".
The building giant's conglomerate structure, which covers the construction sector supply chain from power tools and plumbing supplies to roadbuilding, afforded Fletcher an opportunity to build on slimmer margins than its competitors, industry analysts said. 
But soaring labor costs, a trebling in steel prices and Fletcher's inexperience with managing project design combined to cause cost over-runs and expensive delays.
LOSSES MOUNT, HEADS ROLL
Fletcher has said it expects to lose a total of NZ$660 million on 16 construction contracts.
After issuing a slew of earnings downgrades, it posted a NZ$273 million half-year loss and breached its loan covenants, prompting former Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) boss, Ralph Norris to step down as chairman.
Fletcher replaced its chief executive and said it would quit commercial building after finishing its current jobs.
""There's been quite a realization that there were shortcomings,"" Norris, who plans to steps down by October, told Reuters. ""It's fair to say that the company at the time took on risks, or potential risks, that should more appropriately remain with the client.""
Two people familiar with the Convention Centre design but not authorized to speak publicly about it, said Fletcher significantly underestimated the complexity of building the huge structure, which is five times the size of any other convention office in the country.
""Fletcher was used to building, it didn't do 'design and build'...its teams didn't necessarily have the skills and therefore it didn't manage the design to its budgets very well,"" new Chief Executive Office Ross Taylor told Reuters. 
""Fletcher...took the Convention Centre on contract terms that make it very disadvantaged,"" he added. ""I'm assuming what it was is that they just wanted to get the job.""
The deal left Fletcher exposed to a spike in laborers' wages, the fastest-rising of any occupation between 2009 and 2017, jumping 17.5 percent, according to Statistics New Zealand. 
What's more, global benchmark Shanghai rebar steel futures  are up nearly 200 percent since the deal was done.
The company is confident it can recover from its errors and remains focused on finishing its current projects ""and presenting a new strategy to the market in June,"" a spokeswoman told Reuters by email.
It also plans hiring a board director with construction experience.
INVESTOR JITTERS
But Fletcher Building's investors are unnerved. 
Having piled into the stock as a proxy for the country's construction boom, which fueled 19 consecutive quarters of economic growth, they have since rushed for the exits.
Fletcher's share price has fallen 30 percent in 12 months, now languishing near a 5-1/2 year low. Blackrock (NYSE:BLK), the world's largest fund manager, sold a fifth of its shareholding last month, according to stock exchange filings. 
A spokeswoman from Blackrock in Sydney declined to comment, as did nine other top shareholders.
The company's boom-time blues have also sent a shockwave through the industry.
""What happens when the margin gets squeezed at the top at Fletcher they squeeze it down to the subtrades,"" said Ron Angel, the construction industry coordinator for union E tu.
Peter Ward, Managing Director of Ward Demolition, a subcontractor on the Convention Centre project, said it was a shame to see Fletcher planning to leave the commercial building scene.
""They were the sort of building company that a whole bunch of others aspired to be like and emulate...It's a sad day that they're thinking of chucking it in.""

165,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 07:15PM ET</span>","Blackstone co-founder Peter Peterson dies, aged 91","By Joshua Franklin
(Reuters) - Billionaire Wall Street financier Peter Peterson, who co-founded private equity firm Blackstone (N:BX) and served as U.S. President Richard Nixon's commerce secretary, died on Tuesday of natural causes, his family said. He was 91. 
""As a first-generation American born in Kearney, Nebraska, Pete exceeded all of his expectations in becoming a successful businessman, statesman and philanthropist,"" the Peterson family said in a statement.
The son of Greek immigrants who operated a diner in Kearney, Peterson founded Blackstone in 1985 with Stephen Schwarzman, with an initial investment of $200,000. 
The firm, which is still led by 71-year-old Schwarzman, now manages more than $400 billion in assets and went public in 2007. Forbes estimated Peterson's net worth at $2 billion. 
Peterson and Schwarzman settled on the Blackstone name by combining the German meaning of 'schwarz', which is black, with the meaning of 'petros' in Greek, which translates as stone. 
Peterson received an undergraduate degree from Northwestern University in 1947 and an MBA from the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business in 1951.
He joined the Nixon administration in 1971, serving as assistant to the president for international economic affairs and then commerce secretary from 1972-73.
From Washington he went to Wall Street and was chairman and chief executive at investment bank Lehman Brothers, where he worked until 1983. 
In his later years, Peterson focused more on philanthropy and in 2008 established the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. 
In 2010, he signed The Giving Pledge, an initiative by investor Warren Buffett and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates to encourage the world's billionaires to give away at least 50 percent of their wealth to charity.
Peterson is survived by his wife, five children and nine grandchildren.

Wire rod is a hot-rolled intermediate steel product used in a variety of goods.
Exporters from Italy, South Korea, Spain, Turkey and Britain sold wire rod at 12.41 percent to 18.89 percent, 41.10 percent, 11.08 percent to 32.64 percent, 4.74 percent to 7.94 percent and 147.63 percent less than fair value, respectively, Commerce said in a statement.
It also found Italy and Turkey provided countervailable subsidies to producers at rates of 4.16 percent to 44.18 percent and 3.81 percent to 3.86 percent, respectively.
In 2016, imports of wire rod from Italy, South Korea, Spain, Turkey and Britain were estimated at $12.2 million, $45.6 million, $40.7 million, $41.4 million and $20.5 million, respectively.
If the International Trade Commission finds the imports injure U.S. producers, the Commerce Department will impose the tariffs for five years. The ITC is due to make its determination around May 3. 
In Italy, Ferriere Nord was assigned a dumping margin of 12.41 percent and a subsidy rate of 4.16 percent and Ferriera Valsider a dumping margin of 18.89 percent and a subsidy rate of 44.18 percent. All others were assigned a dumping margin of 12.41 percent and a subsidy rate of 4.16 percent.

Alexander Stubb, vice president of the European Investment Bank, told the paper the two percentage point increase would boost the bank's yearly contribution by 3 billion euros to around 7.8 billion euros.
""We will help to ease the pain of Brexit,"" Stubb told the newspaper.
He said the bank could not completely offset the loss of Britain's funding after 2020, but it could ease the pressure by increasing its own contribution.
The EIB, which is owned by the European Union's member states, uses their capital deposits as security to fund loans for research, infrastructure and environmental projects in Europe and around the world.

Brexit is expected to result in Britain taking back its 16-percent stake of shareholder capital in the bank, leaving a hole of up to nine billion euros in its finances.

170,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 05:50PM ET</span>",Vanguard defends proxy powers for small-time shareholders,"By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - A push to restrict shareholder resolutions could shut out many small investors with concerns about corporate governance, an executive at asset manager Vanguard Group said.
Higher ownership thresholds could undermine shareholders pushing for changes like annual director elections or independent boards, Glenn Booraem, investment stewardship officer at the world's largest mutual fund provider, said in an interview. 
""Some of the proposed higher limits feel like they all but eliminate the ability of anyone but a handful of shareholders to get proposals out there, which we think would be a step back,"" Booraem said.
The comments represented the strongest public defense yet of small shareholders' right by a top asset manager. Booraem did not rule out supporting some higher thresholds, however.
Along with corporate governance issues, the often non-binding shareholder resolutions have taken on new importance lately with rising investor interest in topics like boardroom diversity or climate change. 
Currently shareholders with $2,000 in a major company's stock can submit proposals to be voted on at its annual meeting, a standard critics say should be rewritten to avoid costly and distracting debates.
Some ideas under discussion, like a bill that passed the U.S. House in June requiring resolution filers hold at least 1 percent of a corporation's stock, could shut down some activists, said Booraem, speaking on Monday. 
The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives at major U.S. companies, had praised the bill. [nL1N1K91SI] 
Booream gave the example of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), where 1 percent of shares would be close to $9 billion. 
For context, the most prolific resolution filer, private investor John Chevedden, said he often owns around $10,000 worth of company stock. 
Pennsylvania-based Vanguard manages more than $5 trillion, largely for retail investors, and holds around 8 percent of shares in a typical S&P 500 company. Vanguard and rivals do not file resolutions but vote on those filed by others, including religious or social groups. 
The Business Roundtable's views have not changed and it supports finding ways to improve shareholder engagement including examining the proposal process and proxy filing thresholds, a spokeswoman said.
State pension fund leaders expect businesses to keep pushing for tweaks like higher ownership thresholds or support levels required to re-file a proposal the following year. 
Vanguard also remains concerned about a trend away from equal voting rights, Booream said. 
""Shareholders deserve the right for their voice to be heard,"" he said.

172,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 05:30PM ET</span>",Swiss review criminal complaint filed by figure in 1MDB case,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors are reviewing a criminal complaint filed against two former colleagues and an alleged accomplice by Xavier Justo, a former director of energy group PetroSaudi International Ltd and a key figure in the 1MDB affair.
Justo told Reuters he was trying to clear his name after being jailed in Thailand for blackmailing his former employer over its ties to the scandal-hit Malaysian state fund 1MDB, with which it ran an energy joint venture from 2009 to 2012.
The blackmail allegation arose from Justo's demanding money from PetroSaudi and threatening to make public information he gleaned from his time at the company.
PetroSaudi, which was not itself a subject of the complaint, responded through its lawyers that Justo was merely trying to ""deflect attention from his own wrongdoing"".
It was documents that Justo leaked after he left PetroSaudi in 2011 that triggered investigations in at least six countries into alleged theft of assets from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fund. 
The documents raised suspicions about how funds at the venture were used¬†and prompted investigators to probe suspicions that money had been siphoned off from the joint venture. 
A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level officials of 1MDB and their associates, according to civil lawsuits filed by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up 1MDB in 2009 and served as chairman of its advisory board. He and the fund have denied any wrongdoing.
¬†¬† 
FORCED CONFESSION?
Justo was freed from a Thai prison in an amnesty in 2016.¬†Now he alleges that his confession came under pressure from PetroSaudi executives and their allies -- including public relations officials and a fake London police detective -- to cover up facts in the scandal.
The Swiss Office of the Attorney General confirmed it had received Justo's criminal complaints and was reviewing them, declining to comment further.
PetroSaudi has denied wrongdoing in connection with the 1MDB venture and said it would cooperate fully with authorities.
Asked for comment on Justo's allegations, PetroSaudi's lawyers released a statement saying he was only repeating claims that contradicted his previous admissions.
""Our client did not take any steps to force him to make a false confession. He confessed to blackmail because the evidence against him was overwhelming and incontrovertible,"" it said.
They questioned why Justo had gone public with his criminal complaint at a weekend news conference only months after approaching Swiss authorities.
""It seems to our client that the timing of this press conference suggests it has been carefully orchestrated to coincide with the upcoming elections in Malaysia, when Prime Minister Razak will be seeking re-election,"" they said.
Justo said Swiss authorities had asked him to delay filing charges to avoid interfering with their existing money-laundering investigation. ¬†
The complaints that he and his wife brought against PetroSaudi co-founder and chief executive Tarek Obaid, ex-PetroSaudi director Patrick Mahony and Briton Paul Finnigan include making threats, blackmail, extortion, endangering the lives of others, slanderous denunciation, misleading justice, and money-laundering. 
They could not be reached immediately for comment.
Justo was sentenced to three years in prison in Thailand in 2015 on charges of blackmail and attempted extortion after what he now says was a confession made under pressure from his former PetroSaudi colleagues and their associates including Finnigan, who Justo says posed in Thailand as a detective from London's Metropolitan Police.
""The deal (with his former colleagues) was 'Cooperate, give them whatever they want ... and you will be out before Christmas 2016', so I confessed,"" he told Reuters. ""It was a set-up.""

Justo denied in the interview that he had tried to blackmail PetroSaudi, saying he was simply trying to recover the balance of a 6.5 million Swiss franc settlement agreed when he left the company in 2011.

MuleSoft shareholders would get $36 in cash and 0.0711 of a Salesforce share, or $44.89 per share, representing a premium of 36 percent to Mulesoft's Monday close.
MuleSoft shares were up 5 percent in extended trading after rising 27 percent during the day. Salesforce shares were down more than 2 percent after the bell.
Including debt, the deal was valued at $6.5 billion, the companies said in a joint statement.
""It is really a natural fit for Salesforce to own Mule,"" Steve Koenig, analyst at Wedbush Securities said.
""Salesforce usually helps customers move to the cloud and digitally transform their business that often starts with CRM, so having Mule helps eliminate friction as customers transform their business and to provide a more complete solution,"" he said.
MuleSoft listed on the New York Stock Exchange on March 17 last year at $17 apiece. It closed up 40 percent on the first day of trading, giving it a market value of nearly $3 billion.
Salesforce Ventures, the company's venture capital arm, led a $128 million funding round in MuleSoft in 2015.
Salesforce holds more than 18 percent of the global customer relationship management software market, followed by  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) with 9.4 percent, according to 2016 figures provided by research firm IDC.
MuleSoft makes software that provides enterprises with tools to automatically integrate various applications, devices and disparate data to help businesses networks run faster. It counts  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO), McDonald's Corp (N:MCD), Salesforce and Spotify (N:SPOT) among its customers. 
Reuters had reported about the deal earlier on Tuesday.

BofA Merrill Lynch is Salesforce's financial adviser and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) advised MuleSoft.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com (O:AMZN) became the second most valuable publicly listed U.S. company on Tuesday, surpassing Google parent Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) for the first time.
Amazon shares finished up 2.69 percent at $1,586.51, for a market capitalization of $768 billion, underscoring Wall Street's confidence in its relentless expansion into cloud computing, groceries and other new businesses. 
Alphabet lost 0.39 percent, trimming its stock market value to $762 billion, as Wall Street fretted about regulatory fallout following revelations that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) users. 
(GRAPHIC: Race for $1 trillion market cap - http://reut.rs/2FWeWZK)
Together, Alphabet and Facebook dominate online advertising. They have previously faced government criticism for how they employ their user data.
Amazon's stock has surged 81 percent over the past year, through Monday, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market.
""They're using their cash flow to develop new businesses,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""They could have Apple in their sights at some point.""
Seattle-based Amazon dislodged  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalization in February. Apple (O:AAPL) is the world's most valuable publicly listed company, with a market capitalization of $889 billion.
Obviously, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards. But if Amazon's stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, its market capitalization would hit $1 trillion in late August. 
Apple's market cap would reach $1 trillion around a month later if its stock price continued to rise at the 25 percent pace seen over the past year.
Alphabet's stock has risen 4 percent so far in 2018 and is up 26 percent in the past year.

The median of analyst price targets for the three companies put Amazon's market capitalization at $823 billion, Alphabet's at $914 billion and Apple's at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

180,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 04:31PM ET</span>",Analyst Who Saw Rigged Libor Sees Credit Forces Helping Fuel Run,"(Bloomberg) -- A surge in three-month dollar Libor has roots partly in credit markets, according to the strategist who brought attention to banks lowballing their London interbank offered rate submissions during the financial crisis.
A dearth of interbank transactions has caused financial firms to increasingly use commercial paper to guide the levels they provide to the ICE Benchmark Administration, which compiles them to produce the daily Libor benchmark. Changes to U.S. tax policy have shifted the demand dynamic for short-term corporate borrowing instruments, causing three-month rates to surge, according to Scott Peng, chief executive officer of Advocate Capital Management.
The new warning comes as the three-month London interbank offered rate has risen more than half a percentage point this year and expanded its gap above overnight index swaps. While the cross-currency basis -- a key bellwether for credit concerns in 2008 -- has been stable, Peng says that‚Äôs because the sources of risk are different this time.
‚ÄúAlthough largely ignored by analysts as a driver of the recent Libor widening, credit in our view has definitely played a role,‚Äù Peng wrote in a note Monday. ‚ÄúThe source of the credit widening in 2018 is likely to be foreign financial companies with U.S. operations who utilize the U.S. dollar commercial paper market and are being squeezed by the impact of U.S. tax reform.‚Äù
The December tax changes, which removed U.S. multinational firms‚Äô incentive to avoid repatriating foreign earnings, are fueling demand for very short-term commercial paper at the expense of the three-month sector, Peng said. One possible reason: to have cash on hand for increased spending on labor or capital. Three-month financial commercial paper rates have risen by about 45 basis point this year, while the one-month maturity increased a fraction of that.
The spread between three-month Libor and OIS, a gauge of dollar-funding costs, has more than doubled since the end of January to 55 basis points, the widest since 2009.
Only 18 percent of Libor‚Äôs rise since the end of 2017 is due to credit costs increasing, according to Peng‚Äôs analysis. The brunt, 54 percent, is due to market anticipation of higher rates, and 28 percent reflects increased Treasury bill issuance since the U.S. debt ceiling was suspended in February. That may change.
‚ÄúThis story is clearly evolving in 2018, so definitely stay tuned,‚Äù wrote Peng."

185,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 06:04PM ET</span>",Spotify CEO eligible to sell up to $2 billion stake in public listing,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Daniel Ek, the CEO and co-founder of streaming music leader  Spotify Technology  SA (N:SPOT), is eligible to sell up to 15.8 million shares of the company worth up to $2 billion in its direct listing, the company disclosed in a filing on Tuesday.
In an amended filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Spotify said it expected current shareholders to sell up to 55.7 million ordinary shares when the stock begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 3. 
Instead of a traditional IPO, Spotify plans a direct listing, which will let investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering.
Spotify is valued at roughly $19 billion on the private markets but has not set an opening share price for its direct listing. The company has hired  Morgan Stanley  & Co (N:MS) to help evaluate buy and sell orders on the NYSE to help set an opening price.
But the company, which was founded in Sweden, disclosed for the first time how many shares Ek, its 35-year-old chief executive, would be able to sell. The stake is worth between $775 million to $2 billion at the most recent private market prices, which ranged from $48.93 to $131.88 for the month of March, according to Spotify's updated filing.
The move allows Ek to sell the shares but does not obligate him to do so, and Ek has given no public indication he plans to sell them. Ek will retain 37 percent voting power in Spotify regardless of how many of the newly registered shares he sells. Ek and fellow Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon together control more than 80 percent of the voting power in the company.
Spotify also disclosed for the first time that it would pay Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) cloud computing unit, Google Cloud Platform, at least 365 million euros, or about $447 million, over the course of three years to host Spotify's streaming services.

GE also said in a statement that it will deliver 80 modernized locomotives previously ordered by Canadian Pacific railway Co and 100 to  Norfolk Southern  Corp (N:NSC) in 2018. 
The orders were the latest evidence of major railroads seeking to control costs by refurbishing aging machinery instead of purchasing new engines.
General Electric Chief Executive Officer John Flannery said in November that GE would exit at least $20 billion in operations to improve its financial performance. The company is exploring options for the transportation unit; its iconic lighting division, which makes bulbs for consumers; and its healthcare information technology business. 
A GE spokesman did not immediately reply to an emailed request for comment on what Tuesday's announcement might mean for those plans.
GE will make varying upgrades to aging locomotives - some more than 20 years old - such as improvements to control systems or electrical circuitry. The changes boost hauling capacity but are cheaper than buying new, it said.

""Modernizations will most likely be a strong portion of our locomotive capital spending for a number of years,"" Doug Corbin, an assistant vice president at Norfolk Southern, said in a statement accompanying GE's announcement.

187,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 04:10PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here‚Äôs a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Will the Federal Reserve Add a Fourth Rate Hike?
This and more will be answered on Wednesday at 2:00 p.m. ET, when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) releases its decision on monetary policy, accompanied by its Summary of Economic projections on interest rates, inflation, unemployment and economic growth (GDP).
Investors expect the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will raise rates by 0.25% to 1.50% to 1.75%.
The ‚Äúdot plot,‚Äù ‚Äì which shows where each FOMC member in the meeting thinks interest rates are heading at the end of the year for the next few years and in the longer run ‚Äì is expected to garner the most investor attention.
In December, the Fed‚Äôs ‚Äúdot plot‚Äù indicated the median forecast was a total of three rate hikes in 2018, however, recent hawkish language on inflation among Fed members including chairman Jerome Powell, raised the prospect of a fourth rate hike for 2018.
Goldman Sachs said Tuesday it expects four rate hikes in 2018 and a ‚Äúmore hawkish path for 2019,‚Äù that will raise investor expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes over the longer term.
Investors are also expected to carefully monitor comments from Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell press conference to judge whether the Fed chairman will continue to express optimism on the outlook for inflation and the economy despite a mixed batch of recent data.
Ahead of the FOMC decision on interest rates, the dollar trader higher against its rivals.
2. Rising U.S. Crude Oil Stockpiles to Derail Rally?
A fresh batch of inventory data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. ET could derail bullish sentiment in crude prices as U.S. crude stockpiles to increase for the fourth-straight week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 2.556 million barrels in the week ended March 16.
Crude oil futures settled at three weeks on Wednesday as the prospect of a disruption in Middle East crude supplies rose after Donald Trump hinting at pulling out from the Iran nuclear deal amid a visit from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman.
3. Will Bond Yields Rise to Wreak Havoc on Equities?
A spike in bond yields was cited as one the catalysts that left equity markets nursing heavy losses in February as market participants said higher bond yields would go head-to-head with equities, competing for a larger chunk of investors‚Äô portfolios.
‚ÄúRates do have room to run higher if stocks ignore an implied Fed warning about tightening speed in 2019,‚Äù FTN‚Äôs Jim Vogel warned on Tuesday.
While investor focus will likely be on the Federal Reserve, housing data ‚Äì released well before the FOMC decision ‚Äì will also attract attention after an unexpected slump in January.
Existing Home Sales for February is expected to show a rise of 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.41 million units, after falling 3.2% in January.
The nasdaq closed higher on Tuesday as a 2.7% rally in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) - to surpass Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the second most valuable company - offset ongoing losses in  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB)."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The death of a pedestrian hit by a self-driving Uber vehicle in Arizona this week could offer a test of who can be held legally responsible for accidents when a human is no longer at the wheel, legal experts said.
Any litigation that arises from the accident, the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle, could pit the ride-hailing service against technology suppliers and the vehicle's manufacturer, legal experts said. It could also provide a window into confidential indemnification agreements that companies developing self-driving car systems may have reached to shield themselves legally.
In Sunday's accident, Elaine Herzberg, 49, was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe when she was hit by the Volvo XC90 SUV, which was traveling in autonomous mode at about 40 miles per hour, police said.
Tempe Police Chief Sylvia Moir, who saw video of the crash, told the San Francisco Chronicle late Monday that it ""would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode (autonomous or human-driven) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway.""
The Tempe Police Department said in a statement later that the department does not determine fault in vehicle collisions. ""Ultimately the investigation will be submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office for review and any potential charges,"" it said.
It was not clear whether a lawsuit would be filed on behalf of Herzberg's estate. 
Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina with expertise in self-driving cars, said most states, including Arizona, require drivers to exercise due care to avoid hitting pedestrians on a roadway, even if the pedestrians use an unmarked crosswalk. 
Sergei Lemberg, a California-based lawyer who has brought several lawsuits against self-driving car manufacturers, said that Uber, Volvo, which manufactured the sport utility vehicle, and any companies that supplied self-driving technology could potentially be held liable if litigation ensued from the Tempe accident. The ""safety"" driver who was behind the wheel but who appears not to have operated the vehicle could also be named as a defendant, Lemberg said.
""Suing all these parties would be my top thought right now,"" he said.
Uber said in a statement it was fully cooperating with local authorities investigating the accident.
Volvo, the Swedish car brand owned by China's Geely, confirmed its vehicle was involved in the crash but said the software controlling the SUV was not its own. Volvo said in 2015 it would accept full liability when one of its vehicles equipped with its own self-driving system was in autonomous mode. The company said in 2017 it had agreed to supply Uber with 24,000 self-driving vehicles. 
Until now, most litigation over non-fatal accidents involving self-driving vehicles has been confidentially settled, according to legal experts. A case in which a motorcyclist sued General Motors (N:GM) after a collision last year with one of the company's autonomous test cars in San Francisco is pending.
GM has said in a statement regarding the lawsuit that in its collision report the San Francisco Police Department determined that the autonomous vehicle was not at fault in the accident.
Legal experts said liability in the Tempe case would depend on the facts of the accident and the results of U.S. National Highway Safety Administration and National Transportation Safety Board investigations. 
WITH NO DRIVER, SPOTLIGHT ON DESIGN
Car accident litigation usually turns on whether a driver acted negligently, or failed to exercise a reasonable level of care.
By contrast, a lawsuit involving an autonomous vehicle could revolve around whether the self-driving system had a design defect, legal experts said. 
Design defect claims do not require a finding of fault or negligence. To prevail, a plaintiff must show only that a product had an inherent design defect that would render it unsafe.
Automakers and software writers could counter with detailed data gathered by on-board sensors on how cars behaved during a collision, experts said, to show that it was impossible for the vehicle to avoid a collision and that all the systems functioned properly.
One question that would likely arise in litigation is whether Uber, Volvo or any companies that supplied self-driving technology entered into indemnification agreements, in which an entity assumes another company's liability costs. 
Paul Rafferty, a California-based lawyer who represents carmakers, said such agreements in the autonomous vehicle world are confidential and disputes over indemnification are generally arbitrated or mediated behind closed doors.
Volvo declined to comment on whether it had entered into indemnification agreements with Uber. 
Jennifer Dukarski, a Detroit-based lawyer representing suppliers of autonomous-vehicle technology, said the lawsuit filed by the San Francisco motorcyclist against GM raised only negligence claims. 
So if any litigation in the Arizona accident alleges design defect claims, it could set legal precedent and be ""very impactful"" on the nascent autonomous vehicle industry, she said. 
Regardless of who is at fault, the University of South Carolina's Smith said he would expect Uber, which has faced past scrutiny over its business practices, to settle any litigation quickly to avoid the public spotlight.

""Only if Uber believes that it was wholly without fault could I see this case going to trial,"" he said.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 05:42PM ET</span>","On eve of trial on Time Warner deal, AT&T, U.S. government lay out cases","By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a preview of arguments in a trial over AT&T's (N:T) deal to buy  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX), government lawyers said on Tuesday the deal will raise prices for consumers while AT&T's lawyer argued the company has no reason to withhold programming from competitors as feared.
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, who will decide the case, delayed opening arguments until Thursday because of bad weather in Washington. The government has asked Leon to rule that the $85 billion deal is illegal because it would hurt cable television rivals and, by extension, their consumers.
The government estimates that the deal would hike an average subscriber's monthly cable bill by 45 cents. It filed its lawsuit in November.
At a hearing to discuss how to handle sensitive business information in the trial, AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said it would be ""catastrophic"" for Time Warner to withhold programming in hopes that disgruntled customers would drop their cable company and sign up with AT&T's DirecTV, as the government has said they could do.
Petrocelli argued that Time Warner would lose millions of dollars a month in fees and advertising, and that the few subscribers that DirecTV could gain would not make up the difference.
He also pointed to a voluntary commitment that AT&T made to distributors to refrain from withholding programming if there is an impasse in licensing talks. Twenty of its 1,000 distributors signed on.
Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath said the government's first two witnesses, whom he did not identify, would discuss their companies' negotiations in buying Time Warner content.
""What drives these customers to have concerns is that their negotiating partner (Time Warner) is being acquired by someone they compete with,"" said Conrath.
An official from Google's YouTube (O:GOOGL) will testify on the importance of Time Warner's Turner family of stations, which includes CNN, to DirecTV's rivals, a government lawyer said previously.
AT&T's Petrocelli also noted the role of big technology companies such as Facebook (O:FB), Amazon (O:AMZN), Apple (O:AAPL), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Google in transforming how people watch television and, more to the point, winning away advertisers from the pay TV companies. 
""They are running away with the industry,"" said Petrocelli, noting the internet companies' skill at targeting ads to the right consumer. ""Cable bills can't go up any more because people won't pay any more.""
Conrath indicated that an expert on advertising, whom he did not identify, would testify on this issue.
AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson and Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes are also expected to testify. The trial is expected to last six to eight weeks.
Justice Department lawyer Don Kempf urged the judge to reject AT&T's arguments that some government evidence was nothing more than draft reports written by junior executives, and not indicative of the thinking of top executives.
At issue, was a document that appeared to show that AT&T's business people saw the merger as a way to prevent market changes that would encourage cord-cutting.
Kempf said the preliminary documents show the ""real truth"" of AT&T's thinking. ""The final version isn't the thoughts of the business people. It's the cover story of the lawyers,"" he said.
Looming over the trial is the question of whether U.S. President Donald Trump, who criticized the deal on the campaign trail and again as president, may have influenced the Justice Department's decision to oppose the transaction.

AT&T lawyers have said the Time Warner deal may have been singled out for enforcement, citing Trump's statements that the deal was bad for consumers and the country.

Digital taxation could impact companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Neftlix Inc., and was discussed at the Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires this week as the European Union considers imposing a levy on online companies. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said last week the Trump administration ‚Äúfirmly opposes‚Äù the measure.
‚ÄúWe are looking at it carefully because we need to understand what if anything happens to our tax base based on a changing of the economy towards a different business model,‚Äù Morneau said in an interview at the G-20 meeting Tuesday. We are ‚Äústudying the issue with an intent to have a point of view.‚Äù
Under the European Union proposal, the tax would focus on where tech users are based, rather than where a company chooses to place its European headquarters. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre addressing issues like how the international community is going to think about digital taxation,‚Äù Morneau said.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau‚Äôs government has in the past rejected the idea of taxing Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), a political contentious move.

Morneau didn‚Äôt comment specifically on Netflix.
‚ÄúWe are not studying the issue as an exercise but one that recognizes this presents real differences to how people might be organizing their business over time and where they might be getting profits versus where they might be generating value,‚Äù the finance minister said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Playboy model who said she had an affair with President Donald Trump filed suit in California on Tuesday seeking release from a legal agreement requiring her to stay silent, becoming the second woman this month to contest arrangements not to disclose alleged extramarital relationships with Trump.
Karen McDougal filed the lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court against American Media Inc, publisher of the National Enquirer, which paid her $150,000 in 2016 to keep quiet.
McDougal's lawsuit came on the same day that a New York state judge ruled Trump must face a defamation suit by California restaurateur Summer Zervos, who accused him of sexually harassing her after she appeared on his former reality TV show ""The Apprentice.""
New Yorker magazine last month reported on McDougal's alleged affair and a move by American Media to pay her for rights to her story, which it never published. American Media head David Pecker has described Trump as a ""personal friend.""
In the lawsuit, McDougal claimed she and Trump engaged in a 10-month extramarital ""romantic relationship"" in 2006 and 2007, a time period that overlaps with his alleged affair with adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Trump's wife Melania Trump gave birth to the president's youngest son Barron in 2006.
McDougal said her lawyer at the time, Keith Davidson, secretly negotiated with Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer, on the AMI deal. Cohen has acknowledged arranging to pay Daniels for her silence during the 2016 presidential campaign.
McDougal is asking the court to declare the agreement null and void, saying she was tricked into signing it, that it was intended to illegally influence the 2016 election and because it violates public policy against using threats of legal action to get someone to stay silent on issues of public concern.
She also called the agreement an illegal corporate donation from AMI to the Trump campaign that violated federal election law.
AMI said in a statement the company has a valid contract with McDougal and looks forward to reaching an amicable resolution with her. It said she has been free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with Trump since 2016 and that the suggestion that AMI silenced her is without merit.
""AMI lied to me, made empty promises, and repeatedly intimidated and manipulated me. I just want the opportunity to set the record straight and move on with my life, free from this company, its executives, and its lawyers,"" McDougal, who was Playboy magazine's 1998 Playmate of the Year, said in a statement.
Davidson declined to comment, citing attorney-client privilege. Cohen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, sued the president on March 6, stating Trump never signed an agreement for her to keep her quiet about an ""intimate"" relationship between them. Daniels received $130,000 under that agreement.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Facebook (O:FB), Twitter (N:TWTR) and Snapchat-owner Snap (N:SNAP) fell further on Tuesday as Wall Street fretted over potential regulatory scrutiny that could hobble the business of the social networks. 
Facebook lost 4.75 percent after it said it faced questions from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about how its users' personal data was mined by a political consultancy hired by Donald Trump's campaign.
Since revelations on Saturday that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook users, the world's largest social media company has lost $60 billion of its stock market value. 
With concerns that Facebook's handling of users' data would lead to stepped up government regulation, social media rival Twitter slumped 9.0 percent and was on track for its worst day since July last year.
Snap fell nearly 4.0 percent to $15.86, dipping further below the $17 price set in its public listing a year ago. 
Adding to regulatory jitters, the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that Israel Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked accused Twitter of ""lack of cooperation,"" saying terrorist groups were using the site and that Israel was considering a law to combat such activity. 
Longbow Asset Management Chief Executive Jake Dollarhide said his firm's Twitter stake was in negative territory due to this week's drop. He has no plan to sell because he believes Twitter faces less regulatory risk than Facebook or Snap. 
""The average guy or gal uses it as a news feed,"" Dollarhide said. ""I don't know what personal information I've ever shared on Twitter.""
New European Union privacy rules that go into effect in May will require letting European users opt out of highly targeted online ads, or face fines of up to 4.0 percent of annual revenues.
San Francisco-based Baker Avenue Asset Management chief investment strategist King Lip said Facebook and other social media companies face more regulatory risk from European governments than in the United States. 
Credit reporting agency Equifax's (N:EFX) massive breach of consumers' sensitive financial data disclosed last September led to government probes but no major regulatory or legal changes. 

""Equifax's breach was far more egregious than the Facebook issue, and there hasn't been any significant legislation,"" Lip said. ""I think there's going to be a lot of chatter about privacy issues surrounding Facebook, but I don't think any significant legislation is going to be passed.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue signaled on Tuesday that the Trump administration was backing off efforts to make major changes to the nation's biofuels program and may leave it to lawmakers to settle the divisive issue instead.
The White House spent the last few weeks trying to negotiate a heated dispute between the corn and oil industries, key constituencies for President Donald Trump, over the future of the Renewable Fuel Program - a regulation that requires refiners to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation's fuel.
The RFS has created a lucrative market for Midwest corn farmers, but refiners who must prove compliance by earning or purchasing blending credits say it is too costly.
Perdue said he and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt sent the White House a list of options, but it was unclear if Trump would ultimately implement changes to the RFS on the executive level, as has been widely expected, or whether it would instead leave reforms to Congress.
""The White House is trying to determine whether they need to make a call on a decision, or allow Congress to do it,"" Perdue said. 
Perdue's comments marked the first time the administration has signaled a willingness to let lawmakers take control, said Stephen Brown, a lobbyist for refinery Andeavor, which has supported the legislative pathway.
""A handful of merchant refiners have continued to agitate for any relief, even regulatory that could prove to be fleeting,"" Brown said. ""They are so removed from where the rest of the refining sector as to be considered essentially irrelevant at this point."" 
Perdue did say the Trump administration can make the nation's biofuel laws more affordable for oil refiners without putting a cap on prices for the tradable credits at the center of the program.
""We're hoping that we can resolve it where we will not see RINs capped,"" Perdue said, referring to the name of the credits. He said he instead favored expanding high ethanol blend gasoline sales year round, something he said ""would increase the RIN availability, guiding RIN prices down.""
Perdue made the comments during a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. A video of the speech was provided to Reuters.
Reports that the Trump administration was backing off its plans to enforce changes to the program caused ethanol credit prices to rise by 3 cents, coming off a one-year low of 38 cents earlier in the day, traders said. The prices have plummeted by 40 percent in recent weeks amid political uncertainty in Washington.
The efforts by the White House have drawn sharp criticism from ethanol producers and corn-state lawmakers, who say Trump pledged to preserve the RFS on the campaign trail.
The Republican president has expressed support in the past for capping RIN prices in exchange for allowing sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline all year round.
The Fueling American Jobs Coalition, a group of merchant refiners, said it remained optimistic that Trump would eventually reach a compromise that contained credit costs. 

""Those who make money off of RINs ‚Äì a windfall never intended when the program was established ‚Äì obviously see it differently but haven‚Äôt exactly been in the relevant meetings,"" the coalition said in a statement.

223,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 07:47PM ET</span>",Arizona says not time to rein in self-driving cars after Uber fatality,"By Heather Somerville
TEMPE, Ariz./DETROIT (Reuters) - Arizona officials said on Tuesday they saw no immediate need to tighten rules on the testing of self-driving cars in the state in reaction to a fatal accident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle that has focused attention on the safety of the new technology.
Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said it will pause autonomous vehicle testing following Sunday's accident in which an Uber Technologies Inc self-driving SUV struck and killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona.
Automakers and tech companies are evaluating whether or not to suspend their autonomous vehicle programs in the wake of the first fatality involving a self-driving vehicle. Uber said on Monday it was suspending its own program. 
Toyota said it was temporarily pausing its testing on U.S. public roads to help its test drivers, who could be experiencing ""an emotional effect"" from the incident. 
""This 'timeout' is meant to give them time to come to a sense of balance about the inherent risks of their jobs,"" the automaker said in a statement.
Uber, along with other technology companies and automakers, has been testing in Arizona, which regulates autonomous vehicles with a lighter touch than neighboring states such as California. 
The state has a long history of allowing automakers to test new vehicles on its wide, open roads, and a 2015 executive order by Governor Doug Ducey paved the way for companies to test autonomous technology without interference by the legislature. More than 600 self-driving vehicles are now testing on Arizona roads, according to the governor's office.
On Tuesday, Arizona's director for policy and communications at the state's department of transportation, Kevin Biesty, said existing regulations were sufficient and that the state had no immediate plans to issue new rules. 
""We believe we have enough in our laws right now to regulate automobiles,"" Biesty told Reuters. ""There will be issues that the legislature will have to address in the future as these become more widespread.""
During the early phase of self-driving vehicle testing, Arizona refrained from adding new restrictions on companies testing on state roads, Biesty said, adding they did not believe any new regulations would add to safety. 
Biesty said his agency was waiting for federal safety regulators to conclude an investigation before drawing any conclusions. Arizona's self-driving vehicle oversight committee has not planned any meetings or actions, he said.
Also on Tuesday, Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell issued a statement saying he supported Uber's decision to suspend testing until the end of the investigation. His office said the mayor had not asked other autonomous vehicle companies to suspend testing in the city.
Full details are still forthcoming surrounding the death on Sunday night of pedestrian Elaine Herzberg after she was struck by Uber's test vehicle, a Volvo SC 90 sport utility vehicle, operating in autonomous mode..
Herzberg, who was homeless, was crossing a four-lane road with her bicycle outside of the crosswalk when she was struck.
The Maricopa County Attorney's Office in Phoenix said it was awaiting the results of an investigation by Tempe police before reviewing whether any charges should be filed. Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also are investigating.
The Tempe police department said in a brief statement it ""would like to reaffirm that fault has not been determined in this case.""
The NTSB said investigators had viewed video captured by a camera in the Uber vehicle, and were gathering data from the vehicle and Uber. A photo posted on Twitter by the NTSB showed the front right corner of the vehicle's hood seriously dented. Investigators will be in Tempe for the rest of the week and will not release findings until reviews of information from the scene and analysis of vehicle data are finished, the agency said.
Uber's Advanced Technologies Group office in Tempe appeared empty on Tuesday except for a security guard who said only a small security crew was working at the site since the accident. The autonomous vehicles normally filling the parking lot outside were nowhere to be seen. 
The fatality is drawing fresh attention to the safety of autonomous vehicles, and the challenges of testing them on public streets. Self-driving cars have been involved in minor accidents, but nearly all have been blamed on human motorists hitting the autonomous vehicle. 
The outcome of the investigations in Arizona will be pivotal for companies racing to profit from robo-taxi services and automated delivery vehicles. Among them are General Motors Co (N:GM), Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo unit, ride services company Lyft,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and others.
For a graphic showing one measure of autonomous vehicle performance, click here: (http://tmsnrt.rs/2DFUPgA)
Waymo earlier this month said it began operating self-driving vehicles in Arizona without human minders, offering rides to select customers. GM, through its Cruise Automation unit, has said it plans to launch a robo-taxi service next year, and said on Tuesday it stood by that timeline.
Self-driving startup nuTonomy, owned by Aptiv Plc (N:APTV), said it was temporarily halting its testing on public roads in Boston, following the city's request.
Analysts and experts said the fatality involving Uber could slow progress toward deployment in the sector. 

""What this incident indicates is that the state of autonomous driving (and especially Uber) is very far from where it needs to be to become market-ready,"" Richard Windsor, technology analyst for London-based Edison Investment Research, said in a blog post on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel on Tuesday will ask automakers and regulators why tens of millions of vehicles with faulty Takata air bag inflators remain on the road years after deaths prompted the largest auto safety recall in history.
Nearly 30 million vehicles remain unrepaired in the recall impacting 19 automakers. At least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries worldwide are linked to Takata inflators that can explode, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June.
The recall process ""may play out for another 10 to 15 years,"" Senator Jerry Moran, who heads the Senate Commerce Committee panel that deals with consumer protection and other issues, said in his written opening statement for the hearing.
""It is imperative that all these recalled vehicles are repaired,"" Moran said.
Heidi King, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's deputy administrator, said in written testimony that 21 million of the 50 million air bag inflators recalled by 19 automakers have been repaired to date.
At least 10 million more inflators are expected to be recalled over the next few years, including some interim replacement inflators, NHTSA has said. ""Progress is uneven and overall completion rates are not where we want them to be,"" King said.
Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, where many of the deaths occurred, criticized NHTSA for not pushing automakers harder. The senior Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, Nelson said in his written statement there is a wide disparity in recall completion rates.
The agency ""still seems to be playing a game of regulatory whack-a-mole and twiddling its thumbs when it comes to actually enforcing the coordinated recall approach and benchmarks for automakers,"" Nelson said.
In February,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) warned an additional 33,000 owners of older pickup trucks to stop driving them until Takata inflators can be replaced after the report of a second death in a 2006 Ford Ranger caused by a defective Takata inflator. Ford is testifying Tuesday.
The other 20 deaths have occurred in Honda Motor Co (T:7267) vehicles.
Rick Schostek, executive vice president of Honda North America, will tell the panel the company has repaired 72 percent of the 18.5 million inflators recalled to date. ""This is far ahead of the rest of the industry and reflects our extraordinary effort to reach out to customers,"" he said in testimony.
Under the bankruptcy plan, Takata is selling most assets to Key Safety Systems, a unit of China‚Äôs Ningbo Joyson Electric Corp (SS:600699).
Testimony from Key Safety Chief Financial Officer Joseph Perkins says the company hopes to win approvals so it can close the deal in April 2018.
John D. Buretta, the independent monitor overseeing the massive recalls, said in written testimony that nearly 75 percent of the recalled vehicles are more than 10 years old.
Previously, Buretta said many automakers ""were slow to engage meaningfully and think strategically about how to maximize recall repairs and to deploy the kind of innovative recall techniques needed for the Takata recalls. More recently, there has been marked improvement.""

Takata pleaded guilty in 2017 single felony count of wire fraud to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation and agreed to a $1 billion settlement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Banks in the European Union must quickly Brexit-proof a special type of debt they use to shore up their capital defenses, the EU's banks rescue agency said on Tuesday.
After the financial crisis, regulators have forced banks to bolster their capital with these special bonds that buyers agree can be written down in a crisis to avoid a taxpayer bailout.
Much of this debt, known as MREL, has been issued under British law, casting doubt on whether EU regulators could legally write it down after Britain leaves the bloc next year.
""We have started last year and will carry on this year to tell banks that you need to be prepared for the worst,"" Elke Koenig, chair of the Single Resolution Board, told the economic affairs committee in the European Parliament.
""The worst would be that after Brexit all issuances under English law ... would no longer be qualifying for MREL.""
""We warned that everything that gets issued now should, de minimus, have a contractual clause,"" Koenig said, adding that it would be preferable to have statutory or legal backing.
Some of the debt already has clauses to acknowledge that EU regulators could also write them down.
Most of the EU's 35-40 biggest banks are issuing billions of euros of bonds to meet the MREL requirements set by the SRB last November.
Half of banks already meet their targets, while a number need another two years, though for some ""it's really stretched,"" Koenig said.
""It's a journey and the targets we gave in 2017 were only one step on this journey. More will have to come, quality in particular, but also possibly in quantity,"" Koenig said.
The combination of MREL and ""death"" or resolution plans setting out how a bank can be wound up without causing financial system meltdowns, are a multi-year project, she said.
""Building MREL should happen now. The sun is shining and there is no reason to wait,"" she said.
The SRB also needed more flexibility in setting individual MREL targets, and powers to directly impose them on banks rather than leaving this to national watchdogs, she said.
Koenig urged banks to tackle the EU's 950 billion euro bad loan mountain. ""If the next crisis comes on these levels of non-performing loans, it won't be pretty.""

239,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 03:15PM ET</span>",Former F-Squared CEO must pay $12.4 million in SEC case: U.S. judge,"By Nate Raymond
BOSTON (Reuters) - The former chief executive of F-Squared Investments Inc, once the largest U.S. money manager creating portfolios out of exchange-traded funds, must pay more than $12.4 million for making false statements to investors, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston issued the order after a federal jury in October found former F-Squared CEO Howard Present liable in a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Sorokin said Present had failed to recognize the harm he caused by recklessly making false statements that lured investors seeking to avoid market declines after the 2008 financial crisis.
""Present was reckless, his conduct was repeated, and he has never meaningfully acknowledged or appreciated his own misconduct,"" Sorokin wrote.
The judge ordered Present to disgorge more than $10.85 million in earnings and pay a nearly $1.56 million civil penalty. Sorokin also said an injunction was needed to ensure Present did not engage in future violations given his ""egregious"" conduct.
A lawyer for Present did not respond to requests for comment. Present, the co-founder of Wellesley, Massachusetts-based F-Squared, has denied wrongdoing.
The SEC sued Present in 2014 on the same day it announced F-Squared had agreed to pay $35 million and admit wrongdoing to resolve claims it misled investors by falsely advertising the performance of an investment product called AlphaSector.
At its height, F-Squared was one of the largest U.S. firms of its kind, with more than $28 billion invested with it, the SEC said. It filed for bankruptcy in 2015.
According to the SEC, beginning in September 2008 amid the economic crisis, Present began marketing AlphaSector as having a successful record dating back to 2001 that was based on a multibillion-dollar wealth manager's strategy.
In truth, the data F-Squared used to market AlphaSector was based on an algorithm developed by a college student at a nearby firm and was applied to historical market data, resulting in a hypothetical performance, the SEC said.
The SEC also said an F-Squared analyst who calculated the hypothetical numbers made a mistake in the process that substantially inflated the investment performance that appeared in marketing materials Present wrote. 
Despite learning about the error, Present did not tell the analyst to correct it and continued using the inflated performance figures, the SEC said.
Following a four-week trial, a jury on October found that Present intentionally or recklessly violated the Investment Advisers Act.

The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Present, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 14-cv-14692.

240,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 10:36PM ET</span>","Cambridge Analytica CEO claims influence on U.S. election, Facebook questioned","By Eric Auchard and David Ingram
LONDON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The suspended chief executive of Cambridge Analytica said in a secretly recorded video broadcast on Tuesday that his UK-based political consultancy's online campaign played a decisive role in U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election victory. 
CEO Alexander Nix's comments, which could not be verified, are potentially a further problem for  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) as it faces lawmakers' scrutiny in the United States and Europe over Cambridge Analytica's improper use of 50 million Facebook users' personal data to target voters.
The social media network's shares fell for a second day, closing down 2.5 percent, as investors worried that its dealings with Cambridge Analytica might damage its reputation, deter advertisers and invite restrictive regulation. The company has lost $60 billion of its stock market value over the last two days. 
Cambridge Analytica's board of directors suspended Nix on Tuesday, shortly before the second part of British broadcaster Channel 4's expose of the firm's methods.
In the program Nix describes questionable practices used to influence foreign elections and said his firm did all the research, analytics and targeting of voters for Trump's digital and TV campaigns. He also boasts he met Trump when he was the Republican presidential candidate ""many times"". 
Nix‚Äôs comments ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,"" Cambridge Analytica said in a statement on Tuesday.
Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.
Brad Parscale, the 2016 Trump campaign‚Äôs main digital adviser who dealt regularly with Cambridge Analytica, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Nix's claims.
Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and now senior adviser, oversaw the Trump campaign's digital operations. One former Trump adviser said Kushner brought Cambridge Analytica into the 2016 campaign effort. Kushner's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the Washington Post on Tuesday that in 2014 conservative strategist Steve Bannon, who would go on to be Trump's White House adviser, oversaw the firm's early efforts to collect Facebook data to build detailed profiles on millions of American voters. (http://wapo.st/2HOTQNu)
Bannon approved spending nearly $1 million to acquire data, including Facebook profiles, in 2014, Wylie told the Post. It is unclear whether Bannon knew how Cambridge Analytica was obtaining the Facebook data, the Post reported.
Bannon, who served on Cambridge Analytica's board, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. 
U.S. law bans foreigners from making contributions or spending money on behalf of a U.S. election campaign but it was not illegal for the Trump campaign to retain Cambridge Analytica's services, according to Bradley Smith, a former Republican member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission.
""The fact that they are a British company doesn‚Äôt add anything to the analysis unless they were giving their services away for free or charging below-market rates,‚Äù said Smith, now a professor at the Capital University Law School in Columbus, Ohio.
FTC REVIEW, LAWSUIT 
U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how Cambridge Analytica gained access to user data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.
Facebook said it had been told by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the leading U.S. consumer regulator, that it would receive a letter this week with questions about the data acquired by Cambridge Analytica. It said it had no indication of a formal investigation.
""The entire company is outraged we were deceived,"" Facebook said in a statement on Tuesday. ""We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people‚Äôs information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens.‚Äù
The FTC is reviewing whether Facebook violated a 2011 consent decree it reached with the authority over its privacy practices, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters. 
If the FTC finds Facebook violated terms of the consent decree, it has the power to fine the company thousands of dollars a day per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars.
Facebook was also hit on Tuesday in a San Francisco court by the first of what could be many lawsuits by shareholders claiming to suffer losses because the company misled them about its ability to protect user data.¬†The company could also soon face lawsuits on behalf of users whose personal information was exposed.
Facebook and its peers Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and Twitter already face a backlash from users and lawmakers over their role during the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false information that might have swayed voters toward Trump.
Fear of increased regulation hurt other social media firms on Tuesday. Shares of  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) fell 2.5 percent and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) fell more than 10 percent.
FOREIGN INFLUENCE
U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called on Tuesday for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify in Congress. Congressional staff said the company would brief U.S. Senate and House aides on Wednesday.
A Congressional official said House Intelligence Committee Democrats plan to interview Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Wylie. The committee interviewed Nix by video teleconference, according to the Congressional official, but a transcript of that interview has not yet been made public.
The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting a long-term investigation of alleged Russian interference in U.S. politics and a detailed examination of U.S. election security precautions, would carry out its own inquiry of Cambridge Analytica, a Congressional official with direct knowledge of the investigation said.
The White House said it welcomed inquiries, and that the president believes that Americans' privacy should be protected.
PERSONAL INFORMATION
In Britain, the Information Commissioner's Office, an independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, was seeking a warrant from a judge to search the offices of London-based Cambridge Analytica. It was unclear late on Tuesday whether it had obtained it.
Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.
According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by Bannon.
Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also data from their friends.
Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.
Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.

About 100 police and law enforcement officials searched the luxury carmaker's Munich headquarters and a site in Austria, prosecutors said, adding they had opened an investigation last month against unknown persons for suspected fraud.
Legal sources said the facility searched in Austria was BMW's engine plant in Steyr, where the company employs about 4,500 staff and assembles 6,000 engines a day.
""There is an early suspicion that BMW has used a test bench-related defeat device,"" prosecutors said in a written statement.
Rival German carmaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) admitted in 2015 to using ""defeat device"" software in the United States to cheat diesel engine emissions tests, plunging the company into the biggest business crisis in its 100 year history.
Since then, emissions irregularities have surfaced at several major carmakers, although none has proved as serious as at Volkswagen.
BMW, in a separate statement, said prosecutors were looking into ""erroneously allocated"" software in about 11,400 vehicles of the BMW 750d and BMW M550d luxury models.
Having long denied its cars are equipped with software designed to game emissions tests, BMW said the findings did not reveal a ""targeted manipulation"" of emissions cleaning.

BMW last month recalled 11,700 cars to fix engine management software after discovering the wrong programming had been installed.

246,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 12:03PM ET</span>",Hot Money Stampeded Out of Tech Heavyweights as Flows Show Flips,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors ran for the exits as heavyweight U.S. technology stocks got burned Monday.
The world‚Äôs largest tech exchange-traded fund -- the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), which aims to track the Nasdaq 100 Index -- is seeing dramatic swings in inflows and outflows as volatility ramps up in what had been a fairly calm sector. That‚Äôs leaving the group especially prone to sharp reversals in sentiment, exacerbating price fluctuations.
The 13-week average of weekly flows into the product as a share of total assets rose to 2 percent on Friday after investors poured the most money into the fund since the tail end of the dot-com bubble. On a percentage basis, it was the highest since 2017, the last episode of broad equity volatility before February‚Äôs record one-day spike in the Cboe Volatility Index.
But sentiment flipped dramatically Monday, when concern that regulators will boost oversight of  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). sent the shares tumbling. Investors withdrew almost $2 billion from the fund amid the tech wreck, reversing most of the $3.3 billion added the previous week. The ETF was up 0.2 percent Tuesday as of 11:10 a.m. in New York after Monday‚Äôs 2.3 percent loss.
‚ÄúThis could be the next shoe to drop in terms of crowded trades falling apart,‚Äù said Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Investors may have been lulled into a false sense of complacency by technology‚Äôs ability to outperform during different phases of this bull market, and with relatively low volatility compared to prior periods during which the sector posted massive gains. Over the past five years, the extra volatility in the Nasdaq 100 Index relative to the S&P 500 Index was just 1.1 -- well below the jumpier 1.5 registered from 1995 to 2000, notes Michael Purves, Weeden & Co.‚Äôs chief global strategist. At the same time, the forward price to earnings multiple for the so-called FANG quartet of Facebook, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)., Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX). and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. is more than double that of the broader market.
‚ÄúThis unusual condition is only sustainable if the FANG stocks can continue to maintain their quasi monopolistic position (i.e. no government interference to disrupt their strategic moats) and also requires consumers continue to engage aggressively,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAn unraveling of this low beta/high P/E condition will support market volatility on a sustained basis.‚Äù"
247,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 01:18PM ET</span>","After review, Canada regulator probes banks' market conduct breaches","By Matt Scuffham
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's financial watchdog is investigating the potential breach of market conduct obligations by banks following a year-long review of sales practices at the country's six biggest banks, the agency said on Tuesday.
The breaches relate to the sale of products by the banks without the expressed consent of their customers, the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada's (FCAC) Commissioner Lucie Tedesco said in an interview.
""The information given to the consumer may not have been given to the consumer in a way that is clear, simple and not misleading,"" Tedesco said. ""Sometimes they think they're getting a '2-for-1' deal but don't realize they're paying a premium for that 'add-on' product.""
Tedesco said the study had focused on credit insurance products, about which the FCAC had received the most complaints. The products, meant to protect borrowers in the event of sickness or unemployment, were sold to customers who didn't want them or who would not be eligible to make claims.
The mis-selling of similar products in Britain led to banks paying more than 40 billion pounds ($56 billion) in compensation. 
However, the chance of sizeable payouts by Canadian banks is slimmer because the FCAC does not have the power to order banks to compensate customers who were mis-sold the products. It can, however, impose fines on banks. 
The regulator has a two-year window to investigate the complaints, Tedesco said.
The FCAC said the study had not found evidence of widespread mis-selling, a finding welcomed by the Canadian Banking Association.
""The six largest banks in Canada cooperated fully with FCAC and we are encouraged that the review found no widespread mis-selling and that banks get this right the vast majority of the time,"" said the CBA's chief executive, Neil Parmenter.
The FCAC said the study found that financial incentives for staff may increase the risk of mis-selling. It said it was proposing a number of measures that banks could take to reduce those risks and would beef up its enforcement teams to allow it to monitor banks more proactively. It said its report would be shared with government officials. 
The regulator reviewed the sales practices of Canada's six largest banks; Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada.

(Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) said on Tuesday it was planning to build a plastics plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast to meet the rising demand from Asia.
The plant, which is expected to open by 2021, will help increase its manufacturing capacity by up to 450,000 tons a year.
The expansion is part of Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods' plans to spend $50 billion in the United States over the next five years. 
Earlier this month, the world's largest publicly traded oil producer set a goal to double annual earnings by 2025 through heavier investments. 
The company has been under pressure from investors, some of whom fear that the company's best days may be behind it.
A final decision on investment for Tuesday's plans, estimated at several hundred million dollars, is expected later this year, Exxon said.
""Abundant supplies of domestically produced oil and natural gas have reduced energy costs and created new sources of feedstock for U.S. chemical manufacturing,"" ExxonMobil Chemical Co President John Verity said.
""Most of our planned investment in the Gulf Coast region is focused on supplying emerging markets like Asia."" 
The project will create more than 600 jobs during peak construction and about 60 permanent jobs when production begins, the company said.

Shares of the company were slightly up at $74.42 on Tuesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Morgan Stanley  (N:MS) is starting to see some wealth management customers bring assets into the bank that they had held at other firms, President Colm Kelleher said on Tuesday.
Morgan Stanley's retail investors have put most of their cash balances at the bank to work in the market, and are bringing more money into those accounts, Kelleher said at a financial industry conference in London. 
""They're bringing money from other sources into Morgan Stanley to invest,"" he said, ""so I don't know if that means they're fully invested, or whether we're getting more share of their business.""
In the first two months of the year, which were marked by bursts of volatility, Morgan Stanley's wealth unit posted ""very high"" revenue from accounts whose customers pay per trade rather than a flat fee, he added. That activity has since trailed off.
Kelleher did not provide figures to support his comments.
Wealth management has been a bright spot for Morgan Stanley, helping to offset declines in businesses like bond trading under a business plan outlined by Chief Executive James Gorman several years ago.

Kelleher, who ran Morgan Stanley's trading business before taking on his current role, predicted that first-quarter trading across Wall Street will likely be flat compared to a year ago.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Washington has rejected European Union proposals for an alternative to U.S. safeguard tariffs imposed on solar power goods, the two trading powers said in a joint World Trade Organization filing on Tuesday.
The 30 percent tariff on solar panels was among the first unilateral trade restrictions imposed by the Trump administration as part of a broader protectionist agenda aimed at helping U.S. manufacturers.
Safeguard tariffs are a form of emergency trade protection, permitted under WTO rules if a country is facing a sudden, damaging surge in imports of a particular product. 
But they come with strings attached: the United States is supposed to compensate major solar power-exporting countries by offering them improved trade in other areas, or accept them putting up barriers to U.S. exports to balance things out.
The EU, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia all demanded compensation after U.S. President Donald Trump signed the tariffs into law in January.
At an EU-U.S. meeting on Feb. 15, the EU said its exports were not causing serious damage to U.S. competitors, due to the volume of trade and higher prices, the WTO filing said. 
""Thus, it suggested a form of measure that would be less penalizing for European Union imports such as a quota allocated by country or a minimum import price. The United States did not agree with this,"" the WTO filing said.
""In addition, there was no agreement on the form of compensation,"" though both sides agreed to monitor developments and continue discussions.

In a separate document, the United States and Taiwan said that if there was no agreement between them, Taiwan could introduce compensatory measures in February 2022.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's economic recovery is making it a hot destination for the rich and famous like Madonna as well as tech entrepreneurs and now private equity is looking to participate in the upswing.
Private equity investments in Portugal have more than tripled to 7 billion euros ($8.6 billion) in the past three years, according to data by industry consultant TTR, as investors flock to a rebounding economy hungry for capital.
The 2017 data includes some big deals, such as a 1 billion euros investment by U.S. firm Lone Star, but shows a rise in smaller ones as private equity shifts from distressed assets to healthy companies riding the country's economic growth wave.
Portugal's economy is set to grow 2.2 percent this year, four years after it exited a bailout and seven years since it faced sovereign default, one of several euro-zone countries whose indebtedness had threatened the single currency.
""The sector is now pretty dynamic,"" said Joao Rodrigo Santos, a partner at Lisbon-based Atena Equity Partners. Atena is raising money for a new 40 million euro fund which will take its total assets under management in Portugal to 100 million euros.
""Four or five years ago fundraising was mostly looking to distressed (assets), with many companies struck by the crisis and unbalanced financial structures. Now we see interest in traditional buyouts,"" he said.
The industry is also showing signs of maturity, with a growing number of private equity firms taking profits on earlier deals done several years ago.
Last month, Portuguese private equity firm Explorer sold ROQ, a manufacturer of shirt-printing machines, to two foreign private equity investors -- Spain's Magnum Industrial Partners and Alantra Private Equity -- for 150 million euros.
Explorer declined to disclose its return on the investment but it was sold for several times the original investment. It is raising 125 million euros for another fund.
Luis Quaresma, partner at Iberis Investment, which targets both Portugal and Spain, said his firm was also raising money for a fund that would make investments of 5-25 million euros.
HCapital, which manages 75 million euros, is looking to buy four companies this year and raise a new fund in 2019.
""We are happy with our investments so far ... and recently launched a 20 million euro fund for early stage companies,"" said Joao Oliveira, a partner at HCapital.Mexico's Nexxus Capital said last month Portugal was one of three investment destinations for its plan to invest 350 million euros in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
SWEET SPOT
The government, wary of the resurgent economy embarking on another debt binge, has thrown out the welcome mat for private equity firms, offering to partner with private investors to lower financing costs as well as extending tax concessions.
Lisbon has also created a scheme, Capitalizar, which funnels private equity to smaller firms that struggle to obtain competitive finance from banks still burdened by bad loans.
""We developed a program called Capitalizar with the idea that firms should invest more with an equity base,"" said Portuguese Economy Minister Manuel Caldeira Cabral.
""This program has capital-based financing lines with incentives for funds to invest with equity.""
¬†¬†¬† The government uses part of its 2.4 billion euros Capitalizar scheme to co-invest with private equity firms.
""We have measures to help deal with the restructuring of firms, which is important to reduce bad loans. A lot of them look to guarantee a strong equity base in investments, which is very important,"" Caldeira Cabral said.
¬†¬†¬† The government has promised to maintain a stable tax regime for private equity, but some investors worry it may come under pressure to raise taxes. The ruling socialist party governs in minority with support from communists and the radical party Left Bloc.
""The Portuguese tax framework is ultra-competitive in European and global terms,"" said Nuno Gaioso, head of the Portuguese Risk Capital Association.
But he added: ""While other countries may tax more, some offer a stable tax framework in a 10, 15-year period.""
For now, there are few signs that private equity's interest in Portugal is cooling.
Total assets under management by Portuguese private equity firms stand at around 6 billion euros, up from barely 1 billion euros a decade ago, according to Gaioso.
About 75 percent of those assets are held by restructuring funds that bought up bad bank loans accumulated during the sovereign debt crisis.
But private equity and venture capitalists are shifting their focus to mainstream business, particularly SMEs.
The European Investment Bank (EIB), whose charter includes support for smaller businesses, said Portugal's economic recovery was helping to draw private equity and venture capitalists into the SME funding gap.
The EIB is working with private equity in this regard.
""There are several proposals under scrutiny and we anticipate positive news during 2018,"" said Kim Kreilgaard, head of the EIB in Portugal.

Top of the list of large fund managers' tail risks ‚Äî events investors think are unlikely to happen but very well could ‚Äî is a  trade war.
The last time BAML's monthly survey showed this as the biggest tail risk was in January 2017, just before President Donald Trump was inaugurated. 
More than one year later, Trump is acting on his promise to tighten trade with an 'America First' approach, by imposing  tariffs on steel, aluminum, solar panels, and other US imports. According to Reuters, his administration is expected to announce up to  $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting tech, telecoms, and intellectual property. 
These actions could trigger a trade war if other countries retaliate by restricting goods they import from the US like orange juice and motorcycles.
But that's not even the most worrying thing for Michael Hartnett, BAML's chief investment strategist. 
""Ominously,"" he said in a note on Tuesday, investors are yet to act on their fears. The survey showed they remain bullish on global, bank, and tech stocks, and are betting against bonds and defensive stocks that could be helpful in a downturn. 
As for what's keeping investors bullish, they still expect to profit from earnings growth and low interest rates. In contrast, BAML is forecasting higher volatility, lower corporate bond prices, and peaking stock prices, Hartnett said. 
Even as the  10-year yield inches towards the seemingly  make-or-break level of 3%, investors said only a 3.6% yield would be attractive enough to move them away from stocks and into bonds. "
261,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 10:38AM ET</span>",The feds are reportedly investigating Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal,"The Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook's use of people's personal data,  Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
Citing an unnamed source, Bloomberg reported that the FTC would examine whether the social media company violated a 2011 consumer consent agreement with the FTC over how it would handle and notify users of changes to its user-data policy.
Facebook made the agreement with the FTC in 2011  as part of a settlement following complaints that the social media company had failed to protect users' privacy or properly notify them of how their information would be used or shared.
The FTC will also investigate whether Facebook allowed the data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica access to some Facebook users' data in violation of its policies, according to the report.
The FTC's reported investigation into Facebook is the latest development in a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, which The New York Times and  The Guardian in explosive reports over the weekend revealed had access to the information of 50 million Facebook users.
The data consulting company has been described as instrumental in helping Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and its social media strategy.
The revelations have since led authorities from Britain, the EU, and the US to launch investigations into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.
The FTC said it couldn't confirm an investigation into Facebook was underway, but provided Business Insider with the following statement. ‚ÄúWe are aware of the issues that have been raised but cannot comment on whether we are investigating. We take any allegations of violations of our consent decrees very seriously as we did in 2012 in a privacy case involving Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).‚Äù
According to a former Cambridge Analytica employee named Christopher Wylie, the firm gained access to the information of 50 million Facebook accounts through a third-party research app that offered a personality quiz in return for allowing access to information on their Facebook profile and those of their Facebook friends.
While some 270,000 people are said to have used the personality-quiz app, Wylie said it was able to harvest data on 50 million Facebook accounts through the friend network of those participants.
Facebook has said it was notified that the Facebook data was in the hands of Cambridge Analytica years ago, and the social media company followed up with Cambridge Analytica and demanded the data was deleted. Facebook says Cambridge Analytica said it had deleted the information, but Wylie told the Times and the Guardian that the company held onto the data even after assuring Facebook it had been disposed of.
The CEO of the company, Alexander Nix, was recently  caught on camera bragging that the analytics firm could entrap politicians with bribes and sex workers.
Facebook, which has maintained that the data was not obtained through a security breach but rather a mishandling of the user info from a third-party research app that worked with Cambridge Analytica, saw its stock plummet as much as 8% on Monday. On Monday night, The New York Times reported that Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief information security officer,  is planning to leave the company in August as it grapples with a storm of controversies relating to Facebook's role in spreading misinformation during the election.
Facebook stock was down Tuesday morning following Bloomberg's report of the FTC investigation."

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp on Tuesday announced an approved, science based target to cut greenhouse gas emissions and battle climate change, saying it is the first restaurant company to do so.
Under a plan several years in the making, the fast-food company - along with its franchisees and suppliers - aims to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by roughly one third, preventing 150 million tonnes of them from being released into the atmosphere by 2030. 
""To meet this goal, we will source our food responsibly, promote renewable energy and use it efficiently, and reduce waste and increase recycling,"" McDonald's Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook said. 
The commitment comes as President Donald Trump works to weaken Obama-era efforts to combat climate change. Trump decided last year to pull the United States out of the Paris climate pact. 
Meat processor  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), one of McDonald's suppliers, is among the hundreds of companies that already have committed to fight climate change by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
McDonald's said it would put the greatest emphasis on the largest contributors to its carbon footprint: beef production, restaurant energy usage and sourcing, packaging and waste. Those segments combined account for approximately 64 percent of McDonald's global emissions, the company said.
Among other things, it will support sustainable agricultural practices and packaging. It also plans to install energy-efficient lighting and kitchen equipment, and to encourage recycling in its restaurants.
Between 2015 and 2030, McDonald's and its partners intend to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to its restaurants and offices by 36 percent. The company also aims to reduce emissions intensity per tonne of food and packaging by 31 percent during that time frame. 
McDonald's program was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, a collaboration between the World Resources Institute, the World Wildlife Fund, CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) and the United Nations Global Compact, which help companies address climate change. 
""We are about halfway there already on (total) packaging and waste,"" Francesca DeBiase, McDonald's chief supply chain and sustainability officer. 
The planned reductions are the equivalent of taking 32 million passenger cars off the road for an entire year or planting 3.8 billion trees and growing them for 10 years.
CEO Easterbrook, who also has committed to reducing antibiotic use in chicken and cutting artificial ingredients, said the costs would not be disruptive.

""We're not expecting any substantial shift in business financials either at the corporate or restaurant level,"" Easterbrook said.

263,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 10:10AM ET</span>","Investors crowded into tech sector, BAML March survey finds","LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors were crowded into so-called FAANG and BAT (LON:BATS) tech shares in March and continue to cling to equity holdings despite fears of trade wars and growth slowdown, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's latest monthly survey showed on Tuesday.
The survey of fund managers running $579 billion worldwide was conducted March 9-15 and showed that investors were likely heavily exposed to tech shares, just before Monday's Wall Street plunge that was triggered by calls for more regulation on giant technology firms.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares tumbled 7 percent on Monday amid calls on the firm from U.S. and European lawmakers to explain alleged misuse of its user data. That triggered heavy falls across most of the tech sector worldwide.
The BAML survey found investors were ""long"" the tech sector, calling it the No. 1 crowded trade, with a net 38 percent overweight. Short dollar positions were in second place among crowded trades at 17 percent.
Much of the equity bull run of recent years has been driven by tech shares, dubbed FAANG in the United States after Facebook, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (Google), and BAT in China for Baidoo,  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent. 
But MSCI's U.S. tech index is down more than 4 percent this week after rising almost 40 percent in 2017, taking down their emerging market counterparts as well.
BAML's survey also revealed investors growing jittery about brewing trade wars - growth expectations are now the lowest since July 2016 and inflation expectations the highest since June 2004, BAML said, noting ""cracks in the bull case"".
""Investors have yet to act on these fears, however, as rates and earnings are keeping the bulls bullish,"" Michael Hartnett, BAML's chief investment strategist, said.
The survey found more than half of funds expect global earnings-per-share to grow more than 10 percent in the coming year. And U.S. 10-year bond yields would need to hit 3.6 percent to trigger allocations away from equities, poll participants said.
Trade war was identified by the survey as the biggest tail risk for the first time since January 2017, the month when U.S. President Donald Trump took office with threats to impose import tariffs on several categories of goods especially from China.
On other markets, pessimism toward UK equities hit a record high, with a net 42 percent of investors underweight the British market, as the country heads towards exiting the euro zone with its economy in dissatisfactory shape.
A net 26 percent of funds were overweight Japan, however, and for the first time since 2009, the majority of managers said they did not expect the yen to depreciate over the coming year.
European money managers, meanwhile, were growing increasingly pessimistic.
Only 9 percent of European funds surveyed expected growth to improve in the coming 12 months, a 38 percent fall from last month's poll, while the net proportion expecting stronger company earnings also plummeted by 37 percent on the month. 
""Trade war is seen as the biggest tail risk and Germany is seen as the second most vulnerable equity market to trade wars, behind emerging markets,"" the survey added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is investigating whether Facebook did enough to protect data after a whistleblower said a London-based political consultancy hired by Donald Trump improperly accessed information on 50 million Facebook users to sway public opinion.
Facebook (O:FB) shares closed down nearly 7 percent on Monday, wiping nearly $40 billion off its market value as investors worried that damage to the reputation of the world's largest social media network would deter users and advertisers.
Elizabeth Denham, the head of Britain's Information Commission, is seeking a warrant to search the offices of consultancy Cambridge Analytica after a whistleblower revealed it had harvested the private information of millions of people to support Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
""We are looking at whether or not Facebook secured and safeguarded personal information on the platform and whether when they found out about the loss of the data they acted robustly and whether or not people were informed,"" Denham told BBC Radio.
U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the consulting firm gained access to the data in 2014 and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy.
In Washington, the Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee sent a letter on Monday to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg requesting information and a briefing on the Facebook user data.
""The possibility that Facebook has either not been transparent with consumers or has not been able to verify that third party app developers are transparent with consumers is troubling,"" read the letter which was also addressed to Nigel Oakes, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica's affiliate SCL.
Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission is investigating Facebook. Its shares fell a further 1.8 percent.
In London, the head of Britain's cross-party Media parliamentary committee also wrote to Zuckerberg asking for more information. ""We would like to receive your response by Monday 26 March,"" lawmaker Damian Collins wrote.
In Dublin, Ireland's privacy watchdog said it was following up with Facebook to clarify its oversight. The Irish body is the lead regulator for Facebook in the European Union because the network's European headquarters are in Dublin.
Created in 2013, Cambridge Analytica markets itself as a source of consumer research, targeted advertising and other data-related services to both political and corporate clients.
According to the New York Times, it was launched with $15 million in backing from billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer and a name chosen by the-then future Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon.
Facebook says the data were harvested by a British academic, Aleksandr Kogan, who created an app on the platform that was downloaded by 270,000 people, providing access not only to their own personal data but also their friends'.
Facebook said Kogan then violated its policies by passing the data to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has since suspended both the consulting firm and SCL (Strategic Communication Laboratories), a government and military contractor.
Facebook said it had been told that the data were destroyed.
Kogan says he changed the terms and conditions of his personality-test app on Facebook from academic to commercial part way through the project, according to an email to Cambridge University colleagues obtained and cited by CNN.
Kogan says Facebook made no objection, but Facebook says it was not informed of the change, CNN reported. Kogan was not immediately reachable for comment.
GRAVE VIOLATION
""If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook's policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,"" Facebook said.
Cambridge Analytica has denied all the media claims and said it deleted the data after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.
On Tuesday people were seen carrying multiple plastic storage containers into and out of the building that houses Cambridge Analytica's London office, among other companies. It was not clear which firm they were going to.
""We are not alone in using data from social media sites to extract user information,"" Cambridge Analytica said. ""No Facebook data was used by our data science team in the 2016 presidential campaign.""
Denham, head of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said on Monday she was seeking a warrant to access the offices of Cambridge Analytica after seeing an investigation by Britain's Channel 4 news which secretly recorded its executives boasting of their ability to sway elections.
She said it would not take long to obtain the warrant.
""We have offered to share with the ICO all the information that it asked for and for the ICO to attend our office voluntarily, subject to our agreeing the scope of the inspection,"" Cambridge Analytica said.
Facebook said it had hired forensic auditors from the firm Stroz Friedberg to investigate and determine whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data. The auditors were in Cambridge Analytica's offices on Monday night but left at the request of the British authorities.
The Information Commissioner can currently impose fines of up to 500,000 pounds ($700,000) but will gain the power to fine an organization up to 4 percent of its global turnover when new data protection legislation comes into force in May.
The criticism of Cambridge Analytica presents a new threat to Facebook, which is already under attack over Russia's alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.
""This story comes on the back of increasing scrutiny and societal unease with FB's potential impact on kids as well as increasing concerns around the power of mega cap Internet names, setting the stage for deeper investigation,""  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analyst Lloyd Walmsley wrote in a note, keeping his ""buy"" rating on Facebook stock.
Walmsley said he was worried ""about how scrutiny could ultimately impact Facebook's ability to gather and deploy data for ad targeting, which has been critical to ad efficacy and budget growth"".
The company said last month it had 1.4 billion active daily users, up 14 percent from a year earlier. But the number of daily users in the United States and Canada fell for the first time in its history, dipping in the company's home market by 700,000 from a quarter earlier to 184 million.

LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp (N:FDX) said on Tuesday it will open 500 FedEx Office stores inside Walmart Inc's (N:WMT) U.S. locations, a partnership intended to help both companies attract new customers and handle online order returns. 
The new locations, to open over the next 24 months, are going to be in addition to the 47 stores inside Walmarts across six states that offer packing, shipping and printing services.
Brian Philips, chief executive of FedEx Office, told Reuters in an interview the company spent a lot of time looking at the types of customers visiting these facilities.
""What we found was that 88 percent of customers who come to our location are there to do business with us but over half of them are doing business with the retailer as well. They are buying something at Walmart while they are there,"" Philips said on the sidelines of Shoptalk, a retail conference in Las Vegas.
He also said the move is a significant part of FedEx's strategy to handle returns of items that were ordered online as the company has witnessed orders from retailers triple in volume. 
FedEx is rethinking last-mile package delivery into crowded residential areas and expanding its network of convenience locations, Philips said.

The FedEx Office stores will be 450 to 700 square feet in size. FedEx Office operates approximately 1,900 company-owned stores and locations in the United States.

General Dynamics' revised offer under a merger agreement with CSRA's board represents an equity value of $6.9 billion or $41.25 per share in cash, compared with the prior $6.8 billion or $40.75 per share.
The revised bid from General Dynamics for CSRA, a provider of information technology and related services to the U.S. defense department, is just shy of CACI's $41.79 per share cash-and-stock offer, based on CACI's closing price on Monday.
Given the all-cash nature of General Dynamics's offer, it has considerably less risk and may prevail over CACI's bid, analysts have said.
""We still think the likelihood of General Dynamics and CSRA deal remains high,"" CFRA Research analyst David Holt wrote in a note.
Shares of CSRA rose as much as 1 percent to $41.44, while those of General Dynamic gained 1.3 percent to $226.90.
On Sunday, CACI, which sells information services to national security agencies, offered to buy CSRA for $44 per share, consisting of $15 per share in cash and 0.184 CACI shares for each CSRA share.
CACI's stock fell 7.5 percent on Monday, lowering the offer's overall price. The company's shares rose as much as 5 percent to $152.80 in afternoon trading on Tuesday.
""The rally in CACI's shares is a reflection of investors thinking that General Dynamics will prevail, and that CACI will not put itself in this leveraged position,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Robert Spingarn told Reuters over the phone.
""It remains to be seen though if the CACI management sees it differently.""
CACI said on Tuesday it was reviewing General Dynamics' revised offer.
While CACI has been trying to scale up through acquisitions, General Dynamics expects a deal with CSRA to help grab more of the revised defense budget.

Federal information technology and services spending, down sharply over the past few years due to cuts in defense budget, is expected to pick up again as President Donald Trump seeks to bolster military spending.

(Reuters) - Toys 'R' Us said at a bankruptcy court hearing on Tuesday that it was working hard to maximize payments to suppliers and lenders, as it starts to shutter 735 big-box toy stores across the United States.
More than 50 suppliers, including Barbie maker Mattel (O:MAT) and Lego, have objected in some form to the proceedings by the storied toy retailer to liquidate its U.S. business, putting 30,000 jobs at risk.
Toys 'R' Us had been trying to reorganize under U.S. Chapter 11 but last week said those efforts had failed and it was quickly running out of cash. It is also winding down its U.K business, but is looking for a buyer for operations in Canada, Europe and Asia.
Some trade vendors are demanding the company return any unpaid inventory rather than selling it and using going out of business sales to pay secured lenders and bankruptcy lawyers, at their cost, court papers showed.
""We're making every effort to make sure (trade vendors) will be paid in full,"" Lazard's David Kurtz, who is advising Toys 'R' Us, testified at a hearing at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Virginia. 
The company is seeking approval for a March 26 deadline for bids for each of its foreign businesses, minus U.K., followed by an auction on March 29.
It is also seeking approval for a series of U.S. liquidation procedures including a halt to more than $450 million in supplier payments as part of a plan that experts told Reuters could cause many small toy makers to disappear.
Toys 'R' Us was the last remaining specialty toy retailer in the United States. Hundreds of companies relied on its big-box stores as a showcase for both innovative toys as well as classics.
Under trade agreements, vendors were required to ship goods to Toys 'R' Us on unsecured trade credit. 
In a court filing, Lego said any ""wind-down must be implemented in a manner that is fair and equitable to all"" of the company's creditors.
The U.S. Trustee, a bankruptcy watchdog, has also objected, saying that while it is ""resigned"" to the company's future, it is concerned about certain of the procedures and relief proposed as part of the liquidation.

Toys 'R' Us financial advisor Bill Kosturos of Alvarez & Marsal was also testifying at the hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Keith Phillips, which could run into Wednesday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pratt & Whitney will soon begin deliveries of spare engines to India's IndiGo airlines, which was forced to ground eight of its Airbus (PA:AIR) A320neo aircraft last week after engine problems, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
P&W, owned by United Technologies Corp (N:UTX), will deliver two engines on Wednesday and the remaining within the next 40 days, said the source who did not want to identified.
A series of in-flight engine failures prompted India's aviation regulator to ground 11 aircraft last week fitted with certain P&W engines and operated by IndiGo, the country's biggest carrier by market share, and rival GoAir.
That led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and about a 5 percent fall in the share price of IndiGo's parent, InterGlobe Aviation (NS:INGL), over the past week.
A string of problems has clouded the rollout of P&W's new engines, with the U.S. aviation regulator warning in February that some engines fitted on the narrow-body A320neo planes posed a shutdown risk.
IndiGo and GoAir have hundreds of A320neo planes on order but they, among other carriers, are facing delivery delays due to problems with the engines.
IndiGo did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment, but said in a statement earlier on Tuesday it had canceled no more than 35 to 45 flights a day, which is around 3 percent of its schedule.
""We are mindful of the inconvenience that some of our customers have had due to the cancellation,"" IndiGo president Aditya Ghosh said in the statement. 

""We are actively engaged with the engine manufacturer on getting all our aircraft back in the skies in the coming weeks.""

280,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>","Volkswagen looking at ways to boost Skoda output, including new plant: sources","By Andreas Cremer
BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) is looking at ways to boost production at Skoda, including building a new factory outside the brand's Czech home, to help it keep up with booming demand, company sources said. 
Best known for its low-priced cars, Skoda moved last year into the fast-growing market for sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) with the new Kodiaq and Karoq models, and plans to launch another 19 models by 2020. 
But attempts to increase capacity at its main Czech plant in Mlada Boleslav, where it builds more than half a million cars a year, are in limbo because the Kovo union opposes extending the work-week to Saturday, two Volkswagen (VW) group sources said. 
Skoda has offered to create 3,000 jobs in the Czech Republic if labor leaders agree to additional shifts at the two automaking plants, a move management says could boost output at Mlada Boleslav alone by 83,000 cars a year. 
""Additional capacity is absolutely essential to be able to meet continually growing demand,"" Skoda said in an emailed statement. ""The company has been producing at full capacity for some time.""
Once the butt of jokes in the West, Skoda has blossomed under nearly 30 years of VW ownership to become one of its profit drivers, even beating luxury brand Audi's (DE:NSUG) and BMW's (DE:BMWG) operating margins last year, thanks to its cheap labor and to VW's cost-saving modular production platforms.
Growing demand in Europe and China has helped Skoda's sales to jump nearly a third over the past five years to a record 1.2 million cars in 2017.
Sources said Skoda could miss out on about 360,000 car sales by 2020 if capacity is left unchanged. Production of Skoda models has been expanded in recent years in markets including China, India and Russia.
VW and Skoda are aiming to find solutions by the summer, the sources said, to help the brand with its goal to expand foreign sales to 120 countries, from about 100, by 2025.
Deliberations include searching for under-used capacity within the VW group, as well as investing in a new facility outside the Czech Republic where production could be shared with other VW brands, the sources said.
BOTTTLENECKS
""Of course we are always pleased if brands like Skoda develop very positively. But that also affects other brands where we have bottlenecks,"" VW group chief executive Matthias Mueller told Reuters TV last week when asked how he wanted to solve capacity constraints at Skoda.
""Our platform strategy thankfully gives us a chance to also react at short notice, meaning within a few weeks or months,"" he said, referring to the group's strategy of maximizing the number of parts used in common across brand and model lines.
Last year, labor leaders at the group's VW brand pushed for some Skoda production to be shifted from the Czech Republic to help offset declining output at German sites, fuelling concerns among some Czech workers and politicians.
It remains unclear where Skoda models could be built.
The VW brand's main Wolfsburg plant in Germany is grappling with falling demand for its top-selling Golf hatchback, but utilization has improved at a fellow German plant in Emden, which has been awarded production of another model and so sees no room to build Skodas before 2020, a VW source said.
Audi says capacity is tight at its main Ingolstadt plant in Germany, where some models are based on the MQB platform shared by Skoda.
VW's Spanish brand Seat is also operating near full capacity at Martorell after the new Arona SUV was added to assembly lines, and the brand has swapped production of the higher-volume Audi Q3 for the Audi A1 to ease workload at the factory.
But in the wake of the group's costly diesel emissions scandal, it is likely to want to tap any under-used capacity across the business ahead of building a new factory. 
VW finance chief Frank Witter last week reaffirmed the group's goal to cut both capital spending and R&D costs to 6 percent of sales by 2020, from 6.4 percent and 6.7 percent respectively.
""I have said all along that ... 2017, 2018 and 2019 will be a dog fight, and I haven't changed my view,"" Witter, also Skoda's chairman, said on an earnings call.

At Skoda, management are determined not to lose momentum. ""We are intensively pushing forward Skoda,"" CEO Bernhard Maier said at the Geneva auto show this month. ""We are motivated from head to toe to continue along this path.""

Shipments of Swiss watches rose by 12.9 percent year-on-year in February, according to the Swiss watch industry federation, a tad better than a month earlier - helped in part by a weak performance last February - and confirmed optimism for 2018 from major watchmakers such as Swatch Group (SIX:UHR). 
Swiss watchmakers are emerging from a downturn after sales to China crashed following a corruption crackdown in 2012. 
These are now recovering, fueled by demand from a young generation of Chinese shoppers sustaining a rebound for luxury fashion firms too. 
But the watch industry is still getting to grips with how to revive demand for some of its products, including the cheapest ranges of timepieces facing competition from smartwatches or even mobile phones as customers lose their watch habit. 
And U.S. sales remain broadly weak, even if exports to the three biggest markets for Swiss watchmakers, Hong Kong, the United States and China, all recorded double-digit increases in February. 
Watch exports reflect what brands ship to retail partners -- not what they actually sell to consumers -- so the improvement is only a glimpse into the broader market, suggesting that stock levels in watch stores are normalizing and retailers are confident enough to place new orders.
But Swiss watchmakers are still expected to strike a more upbeat tone when they meet in Basel from Thursday for the Baselworld watch and jewelry fair.
""Sentiment is positive in general and trends look healthy in China,"" RBC analyst Rogerio Fujimori said, adding however that the pick-up in the United States should not be overegged.
He pointed to strong figures published last week by Hong Kong retailer Emperor Watch & Jewellery Ltd. (HK:0887) that suggested that sales to consumers are also improving.
Other underlying challenges also included a gradual switch from stores to e-commerce, Fujimori added. 

The future of the Basel show itself will likely be fodder for conversation too this year. Many small and mid-sized brands will not be present, put off by high costs, and a few top players have joined January's rival Geneva fair instead.

The CISA statement came after the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) decided to terminate its investigation into imports of certain carbon and alloy steel products for alleged violation of antitrust laws, also known as Section 337.
In 2016, the USITC launched a probe into imports of certain carbon and alloy steel cut-to-length plate from 12 countries, including China and South Korea, after receiving complaints from United States Steel Corporation of Pittsburgh (U.S. Steel).
In a statement dated March 19, the USITC said it found U.S. Steel had failed to plead or demonstrate antitrust injury.
The termination of the case marks a small victory for the Chinese metals industry, which is facing trade action from the United States on a number of fronts.
""The U.S. has been continuously creating trade friction with China in the steel sector for many years ... China's steel industry will resolutely respond to the challenges triggered by the U.S. and make the Chinese steel industry bigger and stronger,"" said the CISA statement.

Earlier this month, CISA issued China's most explicit threat in the trade spat so far by urging Beijing to retaliate after U.S. President Donald Trump decided tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports effective March 23.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged up on Tuesday as higher oil prices buoyed the energy sector, but another slump in  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) shares curbed gains. 
Oil prices rose more than 2 percent to touch a three-week high, driven by tensions in the Middle East and the possibility of further declines in Venezuelan crude output.
Those gains helped the S&P energy index (SPNY) up 0.95 percent, making it easily the best performing of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors.
Facebook Inc (O:FB) shares were down 4.2 percent. The social media company said on Tuesday it faced questions from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission about how its users' personal data was mined by a political consultancy hired by President Donald Trump's campaign.
The stock has fallen about 12 percent over the past two session, on track for its biggest two-day decline since July 2012 in a drop that has weighed heavily on equities. 
U.S. and European lawmakers have demanded an explanation of how the consultancy gained access to the data and why Facebook failed to inform its users, raising broader industry questions about consumer privacy and whether heavier regulation is on the horizon.
Shares of  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) fell 3.56 percent, while  Twitter Inc  (N:TWTR) shares tumbled 9.47 percent. The Global X Social Media ETF (O:SOCL) lost 1.2 percent.
""There is a secular issue with Facebook ‚Äì time spent and user growth. That is the real reason we are going down and sellers basically just wanted a reason to latch onto and the latest headlines that came out were the perfect opportunity,"" said Mohannad Aama, Managing Director, Beam Capital Management LLC in New York. 
""I don‚Äôt think the selling is over yet in Facebook but it is a characteristic of the weak market overall.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 127.22 points, or 0.52 percent, to 24,738.13, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 3.89 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,716.81 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 15.68 points, or 0.21 percent, to 7,359.92.
Facebook was the biggest drag on both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 while the Dow, which does not include the social media company, had the largest gain of the three major Wall Street indexes. 
Oracle (N:ORCL) dropped 8.7 percent after the business software maker reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue.
Financial stocks (SPSY) edged up 0.27 percent as investors awaited a near-certain interest rate hike at the end of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting on Wednesday.
Market participants largely expect a total of three rate hikes this year, although some have not written off the possibility the Fed will hike four times. 

Shares of defense companies gained after Reuters reported Trump plans to boost the exports of lethal drones to more U.S. allies. Kratos Defense (O:KTOS) rose 3.7 percent and  Boeing Co  (N:BA) gained 1.9 percent.

311,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",EU lawmakers act to address 'unfair' airline competition rules,"By Julia Fioretti
(Reuters) - Non-EU carriers could see their rights to fly in the bloc revoked if they or their home countries engage in ""unfair"" competitive practices under rules voted on by a European Parliament committee on Tuesday.
Some EU airlines, notably Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), have long complained about what they see as unfair competition from carriers such as those in the Gulf region - Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways - whom they accuse of receiving illegal state subsidies.
The three airlines have vehemently denied such claims.
While the rules passed by members of the European Parliament's transport committee on Tuesday are not the final version of the law, they represent a hardening of the original European Commission proposal.
""The pressure from highly subsidized third country carriers is increasingly noticeable. It potentially undermines a level playing field in the market, at the expense of European airlines,"" said Markus Pieper, the EU lawmaker who is steering the legislation through the European parliament.
""Particularly carriers from the Gulf region, Turkey, China and Russia have strong state connections which can cause market distortions.""
The proposal would allow EU governments and airlines to submit complaints to the European Commission about alleged discriminatory practices they face in non-EU countries or illegal subsidies benefiting non-EU airlines.
The version passed by the European Parliament would see the Commission being able to impose ""provisional redressive measures"" on third country airlines even before an investigation has been concluded to prevent irreversible injury. 
The provision was pushed by the second largest group in the Brussels legislature, the Socialists and Democrats.
The Commission - the EU executive - had not originally proposed curtailing airlines' flying rights as these are typically granted on a bilateral basis between governments.
Instead it had proposed financial penalties or other measures such as a suspension of ground services.
The Commission has denied that the proposed regulation is a protectionist measure, but many EU governments oppose it on the grounds that it could hurt transport links to their countries.
The Gulf airlines have faced similar pressure in the United States.
Qatar recently agreed to release detailed financial information about state-owned Qatar Airways after talks with the U.S. government.

EU lawmakers will have to reach an agreement with member states on a final version of the EU regulation before it can take effect, meaning it will likely undergo further changes.

The firm's European head, Detlef Scholz, told Reuters just months after the 2016 Brexit vote that DBRS was likely to need an EU office, but maintained on Tuesday that there would be no mass shift from London where it currently employs around 100 staff.
""Our London office has a very international and diverse workforce so it will be attractive for some to relocate,"" Scholz said. 
""These are discussions that will need to be had around the kitchen table. ... But I'm confident several people will transfer, and we will then supplement those with local hires,"" he said.
The Brexit problem is bigger for Canada's DBRS because all of its European analysts are currently based in London, whereas the big three of S&P, Moody‚Äôs and Fitch already have sizable offices in cities such as Frankfurt, Paris and Madrid.
Pressure has also been cranked up by the Paris-based industry regulator, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which only last month ordered agencies to ensure their Brexit plans were in place by the end of the year.
ESMA wants to ensure that there are no last minute headaches for an industry that quality-checks trillions of euros and pounds worth of financial assets ranging from government bonds to complex securitized loans.
Scholz said upheaval will hopefully be kept to a minimum following Monday's outline agreement between Britain and the EU on a near two-year Brexit transition deal.
""The UK could implement a (regulatory) regime that mirrors the European rules, that is my anticipation,"" he said. ""I think it is reasonable to expect that the starting point of the future UK law is the existing EU law.""

However, ESMA has said rating firms would need have to ""sufficient presence"" in terms of both analysts and senior management and compliance departments in a remaining EU country when Brexit takes place.

MILAN (Reuters) - European stocks struggled to hold on to opening gains on Tuesday as tech stocks stayed under pressure after concerns over increased regulation and taxation of large tech companies prompted selling overnight on Wall Street.
Support from Publicis (PA:PUBP) evaporated as its shares turned lower following early gains of as much as 3 percent as analysts showed a mixed reception to its new business plan in a challenging advertising market. 
The world's third largest advertising group said it was redoubling efforts to become a consulting partner for global advertisers online to help boost sluggish growth.
The plan envisages a 4 percent underlying sales growth target in 2020 by tapping its digital arm Publicis.Sapient and fostering greater collaboration between its myriad of agencies. 
Liberum analyst Ian Whittake affirmed his ""Hold"" rating on the stock, calling the plan ambitious.
""On a general level, Publicis has taken probably the most 'bearish' view on the future of agencies, which probably reflects its acquisition of IT consultancy firm Sapient, and the wording of the statement reflects that,"" he said.
By 0932 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was down 0.1 percent, while the UK's FTSE (FTSE) was up 0.1 percent after hitting a 15-month low in the previous session.
Advertisers and media stocks are among the worst performers in Europe over the last 12 months, as they struggle to compete against big U.S. internet players like Google (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB), which now face growing regulatory scrutiny. 
The European Union is proposing a 3 percent tax on turnover of large companies with significant digital revenues, according to a draft proposal seen by Reuters. 
Tech (SX8P) stocks fell 0.2 percent, having lost more than 1.5 percent in the previous session. The sector however remains the biggest gainer in Europe over the last 12 months.
Shares in German software maker SAP (DE:SAPG) fell 1 percent on a negative read-across from disappointing results at U.S. peer Oracle (N:ORCL) which reported a disappointing quarterly update as sales from its cloud business fell short of Wall Street expectations. 
""(The) hickup in Oracle's cloud business could hurt SAP sentiment,"" said a trader in Frankfurt.
UK software company  Micro Focus  (L:MCRO) however rose 2.8 percent, having lost 46.3 percent in the previous session after its CEO quit and it cut its revenue outlook.
More than 7 analysts cut their price targets on Micro Focus.
In M&A news, Fenner (L:FENR) surged 25 percent after French tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) announced plans to buy the British engineering company for 1.2 billion pounds.
Fenner shares were traded at 612 pence, just above the 610 pence cash offer from Michelin, whose shares dipped 0.1 percent. 

Elsewhere, a sell rating from UBS sent shares in France's BIC (PA:BICP) down 5.5 percent to the bottom of the STOXX.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 10:55AM ET</span>",Prosecutors search Volkswagen headquarters in new emissions investigation,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German prosecutors said on Tuesday they had searched Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) headquarters as part of a new investigation into whether the carmaker had overstated the fuel efficiency of more vehicles than previously disclosed. 
The news is the latest setback in the German company's efforts to move on from a 2015 scandal in which it admitted to cheating U.S. emissions tests on diesel engines. 
Prosecutors from the city of Braunschweig searched 13 offices at Volkswagen's (VW) headquarters in nearby Wolfsburg at the start of March, seizing documents and computer files that will now be reviewed, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office said, confirming a report by German magazine WirtschaftsWoche.
They were checking a statement issued by VW on Dec. 9, 2015 - about three months after its ""dieselgate"" scandal broke in the United States - over suspicions its contents were incorrect
In that statement, VW said its own investigations found it had understated fuel consumption, and hence carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, on no more than 36,000 vehicles.
That was much lower than its preliminary estimate of around 800,000 diesel and gasoline vehicles produced five weeks earlier, which caused VW to warn it could face a 2 billion euro ($2.5 billion) hit to profits from the disclosure. 
VW also said in its December 2015 statement that it had found no evidence of unlawful alterations to CO2 emissions data.
Prosecutors said on Tuesday they were investigating unknown individuals over suspicions of market manipulation. 
VW, Europe's biggest carmaker, confirmed the searches, but declined further comment. 
At 1410 GMT, its shares were little changed at 160.35 euros.
Separately, Braunschweig prosecutors are investigating VW's former CEO Martin Winterkorn, former finance chief and current chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, and current VW brand CEO Herbert Diess over possible market manipulations related to the dieselgate scandal. VW has denied any market manipulations.
Manfred Doess, head of legal affairs at VW's majority stakeholder  Porsche  SE (DE:PSHG_p), said on Tuesday he did not expect the latest inquiry to lead authorities to press charges against VW.
""In my judgement, nothing will come out of this,"" Doess said at the holding firm's earnings press conference.
Since its dieselgate scandal, VW has launched a multibillion-dollar investment in electric vehicles and mobility services as part of an attempt to rebuild its image.

325,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 01:30AM ET</span>",CEFC China's chairman to step down; CITIC in talks to buy stake in unit,"By Jan Lopatka and Chen Aizhu
PRAGUE/BEIJING (Reuters) - CEFC China Energy Chairman Ye Jianming, under investigation in China over suspected economic crimes, will step down from his position at the Chinese conglomerate, a company executive and the Czech Republic president's office said.
The news came as CEFC's Czech subsidiary CEFC Europe pulled plans for its biggest deal in Czech Republic yet and the CEFC executive told Reuters the company was in talks for state-run CITIC to take a stake in the unit.
The once-acquisitive private firm, which has agreed to buy a $9.1 billion stake in Russian oil major Rosneft (MM:ROSN), is expected to make an announcement on Ye's exit soon, a Beijing-based company executive briefed on the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. He declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. A CEFC spokesman said he could not confirm the move.
CITIC could not immediately be reached for comment.
Beijing has been seeking to curtail big-spending conglomerates in a crackdown on financial risk. The Chinese government seized control of Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd in February and said its chairman had been prosecuted.
Ye's planned departure and the overhaul of CEFC's European business come after Reuters and other media reported earlier this month that Ye, who founded the company in 2002, had been investigated for suspected economic crimes.
Concerns have also mounted about the finances and opaque ownership of the company, which has grown in a few years from a niche fuel trader into an oil and finance conglomerate with assets across the world.
Reuters reported the group has scrambled to secure short-term funding, while Guosheng Group, an investment firm owned by the Shanghai government, has been tasked with evaluating CEFC's financial position as part of a restructuring and takeover process.
State-controlled China Huarong Asset Management Co has taken a 36.2-percent stake in CEFC Hainan International, the unit which is acquiring the Rosneft stake.
CEFC China Energy said at the time of news of the probe it was ""operating normally"" and that media reports about Ye ""had no basis in fact"". 
Shares in subsidiary CEFC Anhui International Holding Co Ltd (SZ:002018) were suspended on Monday afternoon pending an announcement.
CZECH DELEGATION 
The office of Czech President Milos Zeman disclosed on Monday the first details of a visit by two aides to China last week aimed at seeking information about Ye. 
CEFC told the delegation Ye was leaving his post and the company's shareholder structure, while the Shanghai government and other state officials confirmed he was being investigated on ""suspicion of breaking the law"", it said in a statement. The delegation met with CEFC President Chan Chauto.
Also on Monday, CEFC's Czech-based unit CEFC Europe dropped its plan to raise its stake in Prague-based J&T financial group, a bank and investment vehicle, to 50 percent from 9.9 percent.
It would have been CEFC's biggest deal yet in the country. It also has stakes in Czech brewery group Lobkowicz, Prague soccer club Slavia Praha, the national airline, hotels and real estate.
A spokeswoman for J&T said the move was a ""logical conclusion of the current situation"".
CEFC Europe also said in a statement there was a ""planned change in the shareholder structure"" of CEFC and Ye would ""no longer be active as a shareholder nor in the company's leadership.""
CEFC Europe said the firm's activities in Czech Republic would continue, and a new unnamed Chinese shareholder would join the firm.
Czech news website www.tyden.cz said without naming its sources the new shareholder would be China's state-owned CITIC Group, and that it would take a 49 percent stake in CEFC Europe. 

Bonds with a total value of 14 billion yuan ($2.21 billion) issued by CEFC Shanghai International Group have been halted since early March and a major domestic credit rating agency downgraded the unit.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 01:16AM ET</span>",From Wall Street to weed: How the financial crisis lit up the pot industry,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a senior vice president at Wachovia and then  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) during the dark months of the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis, Derek Peterson watched as colleagues lost their jobs and life savings and wondered if he was next. 
At the time, he was managing approximately $120 million in client assets, but was growing disenchanted with what he saw as a U.S. stock market driven by high-frequency trading and algorithms rather than fundamentals. He started looking for other opportunities, and soon stumbled on some of the first legal medical marijuana dispensaries that had opened in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
""I started looking at this through a finance guy's eyes and saw that maybe there was something going on here,"" he said.
He soon discovered that dispensaries were bringing in sales of more than $4,000 per square foot, a rate higher than any U.S. retailer but Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) , and more than 12 times the average $325 per square foot among all companies in the sector. 
""You had places the size of Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) bringing in $15 million a year, which is absurd,"" Peterson said. 
He quit his day job at Morgan Stanley in late 2010, and in 2012 became chief executive officer and president of Terra Tech Corp, which is now a $247 million company that cultivates medical marijuana and whose shares trade on the over-the-counter market, making it one of the few publicly traded pot stocks. 
Peterson is not alone in the jump from Wall Street to weed.
Ten years after the start of the financial crisis, what was once the province of shady stoners and drug cartels is now a thriving industry, with recreational marijuana legal in states ranging from California to Massachusetts. (Map: http://tmsnrt.rs/2AFalvZ)
Powering the expansion of the industry are former Wall Street executives like Peterson that hail from such staid firms as BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) ,  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) and Prudential Financial Inc (NYSE:PRU), all of whom say that they might not have ever left traditional finance if not for the lingering damage of the 2008 crisis. 
There are few reliable numbers on how many former Wall Street professionals who now work in the cannabis industry, though those in the sector say that they expect the migration to accelerate as revenue growth continues to attract talent.
Companies in the U.S. marijuana market posted revenues of approximately $6 billion in 2017, a 500 percent increase from the roughly $1 billion in 2011, according to estimates from Marijuana Business Daily, a trade publication. 
Approximately 250,000 people work in the sector, and both jobs and revenues are expected to double or triple over the next four years, the publication estimates. 
""The financial crisis and the stagnation of many industries in the U.S. in its aftermath have led many people to consider this a viable career,"" said Chris Walsh, editorial vice president at Marijuana Business Daily. 
LINGERING FEARS OF WASHINGTON
Despite the growth prospects, many financial professionals are still too leery of federal law, which considers marijuana an illegal drug, to take a job in the industry until there are clear signals from Washington or a change in the makeup of government, said Ruth Epstein, a partner at San Francisco-based BGP Advisors, a business advisory firm that focuses on companies in the cannabis sector.
In January, the Justice Department reversed a policy from the Obama administration which allowed states to legalize marijuana without fears of a federal crackdown. That has had a ""chilling effect"" on recruiting within the industry, Epstein said. 
""People have really been scared away from investing and to a large extent that same mentality is keeping the talent away,"" said Epstein, a Harvard Business School graduate who spent nearly 10 years on the corporate finance desk at Goldman Sachs. That, in turn, has ""created a massive opportunity for someone who understands finance and is willing to be out on the vanguard,"" she added.
Morgan Paxhia, co-founder of San Francisco-based Poseidon Asset Management, a $25 million hedge fund that focuses exclusively on the marijuana sector, was a trader on the municipal debt desk at UBS in New York during the financial crisis. He would pass by the Lehman Brothers building each day on the way to work, and it felt as if ""the building were just cratering around you,"" he said. 
He was laid off on March 9, 2009, the day that the U.S. stock market finally bottomed out. He spent a few years at a registered investment adviser before starting Poseidon with his sister, Emily, in 2013, attracted by the possibility of growth at a time when financial companies seemed to be overly cautious, he said.
""If the financial crisis never happened we would have banks in this industry already, but they won't push this industry forward because they're too afraid,"" he said. ""It's opened up huge opportunities for those who are willing to come in and capitalize it."" 
Peterson, the Terra Tech CEO, said that he now routinely fields calls from employees of large banks and investment firms who are looking to enter the industry. That is a steep change from his first few years in the pot sector, when it was still largely ruled by black-market growers and questionable outfits. 

""When I first started out, the fact that I had worked on Wall Street made me seem like a real outsider, to the point where people would ask, ""Are you a narc?'"" he said, referring to a federal narcotics officer. ""It's in the last two years that we've seen a tremendous influx of people from traditional business backgrounds.""

329,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 12:32AM ET</span>",Whole Foods calls supplier summit amid Amazon angst,"By Lisa Baertlein and Chris Prentice
LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Whole Foods will host a summit on Tuesday for up to 200 of its suppliers, amid anxiety about how its ongoing business revamp will play out under new owner Amazon.com (O:AMZN).
Amazon's $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods last summer shook the grocery industry, spawning worries that the ecommerce giant would disrupt groceries the way it upended books, toys and electronics.
In a restructuring effort underway before the acquisition, Whole Foods earlier this year began requiring suppliers to use a firm of its choosing to restock shelves and run promotions. As first reported in the Washington Post, Whole Foods is charging some suppliers the equivalent of 3 percent to 5 percent of sales to cover the cost of those broker services.
In addition, Whole Foods adopted a Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) style model for in-store sampling, asking companies to pay fees when Whole Foods offers shoppers free samples of their products.
Those changes caused heartburn for some small upstart brands. ""There's been a lot of brands at Whole Foods that probably shouldn't have been there to begin with,"" said food industry consultant Phil Lempert, who added that it should not be a surprise that the formerly freewheeling retailer is beginning to act like a more mainstream business.
Several mid-sized suppliers told Reuters they supported Whole Foods' efforts to date.
""We have a chance to move faster,"" said Califia Farms Chief Executive Greg Steltenpohl, among those who said he planned to attend the summit.
Califia sells almond milk and bottled coffee drinks at Whole Foods and on Amazon.com, which recently invited the Los Angeles-based company to be one of 52 brands to be featured on Amazon Launchpad, a new marketing service that aims to connect brands with Amazon shoppers.
""The changes we've been making across the company directly address the feedback our supplier partners have shared over the years about the challenges of our decentralized purchasing structure and inconsistent practices across regions and stores,"" Whole Foods spokeswoman Robin Rehfield Kelly said in a statement.
Kelly said Whole Foods has worked for the last two years to streamline its processes across global and regional purchasing teams to ensure all its suppliers are supported under a consistent company-wide set of protocols.
Whole Foods Chief Executive John Mackey and members of the chain's marketing and merchandising team will host the summit.
PIONEER 2.0
Whole Foods explosive growth faltered after  Kroger Co  (N:KR), Walmart (N:WMT) and other retailers started charging less for the many of the natural, organic and niche products that once set Whole Foods apart, giving it the ability to charge premium prices.
Since the restructuring, Whole Foods has replaced or stripped the power of its regional ""foragers,"" who identified and nurtured small brands. Without those champions, some of those products are being eliminated to make space for bigger, faster-moving brands.
""It was kind of disorganized before. More organization and clear communications is definitely better,"" said Steve Savage, chief executive of Boulder, Colorado's 1908 Brands, which sells Boulder Clean laundry detergent and other products at the chain.
""Amazon has encouraged Whole Foods to be more aggressive,"" said Jeff ""Trip"" Tripician, general manager of Niman Ranch. It saw a robust rise in sales of its hams, sausage and bacon at the 473-store chain since the Amazon purchase, he said.
Average monthly foot traffic at Whole Foods has increased by 1.3 percent since the Amazon acquisition news broke in June, according to Venice Beach, California-based InMarket, which uses location data from 50 million smartphones to analyze visitation trends.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) has signed LPL Financial Holdings, the largest U.S. independent broker-dealer by revenue, to its securities-based lending platform, the bank said on Tuesday. 
Called GS Select, the platform was launched last year as a way for the Wall Street bank to target borrowers who have less than $10 million in investable assets. GS Select issues loans worth $75,000 to $25 million that are collateralized by the borrowers' investment portfolios.
Goldman's typical wealth clients have at least $50 million in assets. To reach ""mass affluent"" borrowers, the bank has forged relationships with mainstream wealth management firms who provide those clients with financial advice.
LPL provides technology, research and support to roughly 14,000 independent U.S. financial advisers who manage around 4 million client accounts. It is one of the largest firms to join the GS Select program, which currently supports 40 independent adviser firms and broker/dealers, according to a statement. 

Last year, the bank announced it was partnering with Fidelity Investment's clearing and custody business, which caters to small brokerages and wealth management firms.

Investors‚Äô focus now turns to the first U.S. interest rate decision under new Fed chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Zhang Xixi, a 25-year-old staffer at an online financial company in China's southern province of Guangdong, decided last year to buy personal insurance for the first time, he was swamped with options.
Local insurers rushed to offer him products with attractive financial returns. In the end, he decided on a simpler, ""more reliable"" product sold by the unit of a U.S. life insurer.
Customers like Zhang are helping foreign insurers quickly gain market share in China, aided by a regulatory crackdown on short-term investments packaged as insurance that has hurt many of their local rivals. 
The growth of China's middle class and their rising wages have meant more people are looking for insurance, said Asia-focused AIA's regional chief executive, John Cai, who leads the company in China and some Southeast Asian markets. 
""We have the differentiated strategy by focussing on selling protection products ... and we reaped the benefit of that,"" he said, referring to a 60 percent jump last year in the Hong Kong-based company's value of new business in China, up from a growth rate of 54 percent in 2016.
Foreign insurers, including AIA Group,  Aviva  (LON:AV) and  Prudential  (LON:PRU) have been in China for decades, but their collective market share is still below 10 percent as a result of regulatory restrictions and limited awareness about insurance as coverage rather than an investment.
Current rules limit foreign holdings in Chinese insurance joint ventures to 50 percent. AIA is the only wholly owned foreign insurance firm in China as its operations were set up before the restrictions were introduced.
Beijing said last year it planned to lift the ownership cap to 51 percent for foreign insurance joint ventures in 2020 and remove the limit completely two years later, which would allow for further expansion.
Both Prudential and Aviva saw new business profit in China, a key measure of long-term profitability, more than double last year on the back of higher demand for traditional protection products. 
Many foreign insurance companies are strengthening their presence in smaller cities, where insurance penetration - measured in terms of the value of premiums underwritten as a percentage of gross domestic product - is lower than the 3 percent of GDP figure for the country as a whole. 
Insurance ownership in the United States runs at 7 percent of GDP and is at 10 percent in Britain and Japan. China's relatively low rate and strong economic outlook is the biggest draw for foreign insurers.
That has led to a hiring binge: leading foreign insurers are looking to bring on up to 40 percent more front-line sales agents in China this year - twice the rate of recent years, executives and consultants said. 
AIA, for example, had close to 35,000 agents at the end of last year compared with 15,000 in 2014, and Cai expects a similar hiring growth rate as the company expands into second- and third-tier cities.
The sector regulator in China is also likely to make it easier for foreign insurers to expand into new provinces, said a Beijing-based lawyer who works with the China Insurance Regulatory Commission.
LOCAL COMPETITION
Top Chinese firms such as China Life Insurance and Ping An Insurance Group remain dominant players on their home turf, collectively holding about 90 percent of the life insurance market. 
But their industry is in the midst of a massive regulator-driven clean-up of the life insurance sector, the world's No. 3 market, to limit risk to the financial system.
Last month, Beijing took control of Anbang after keeping it under the microscope over the past year or so for risky behavior.
As a result of those measures, Chinese insurance firms saw their net operating cash flow slump 65 percent in 2017, Reuters reported in January, citing data in a government memo. Assets held in universal life insurance funds dropped 50 percent.
Rating agency Fitch expects premium growth to remain low in 2018 as Chinese life insurers shift from short-term investment products to more complicated products with protection features favored by the regulator.
""We have traditionally focused on that business, certainly in the last three or four years, on health and protection products versus competing for savings or bank-type products,"" said Prudential Group's chief executive Mike Wells. 
Enthused by a surge in demand, growing awareness and rising wealth in smaller Chinese cities such as Foshan, Taizhou and Xuzhou, insurers such as AIA and Prudential are stepping up their presence in those markets, executives said. 
""From the growth rate you can tell the opportunity is there, the market is even less penetrated. However, the wealth effect and the average income is rising,"" AIA's Cai said, referring to the smaller Chinese cities. ""So we do see similar success will be coming there.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Global equities trod water on Tuesday ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve policy meeting, while investors reassessed their views of tech stocks following a slump in Facebook's shares after reports of data misuse.
The MSCI world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat in percentage terms by 0901 GMT, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) equity index slipped 0.1 percent.
Tech (SX8P) stocks underperformed in Europe as the sector fell 0.3 percent, taking its cue from Monday's falls for U.S. peers on the back of fears of stiffer regulation as Facebook came under fire following reports it allowed improper access to user data.
Shares in European chipmakers in particular came under pressure, with ams (S:AMS), STMicroelectronics (MI:STM) and ASML (AS:ASML) all in negative territory, while Germany's SAP (DE:SAPG) declined 0.5 percent, hit by readacross from U.S. business software peer  Oracle Corp  (NYSE:ORCL), whose quarterly revenue missed analysts' estimates. 
In the U.S., Facebook (O:FB) tumbled 6.8 percent on Monday as the social media colossus faced demands for action from U.S. and European lawmakers following reports that a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's election campaign may have improperly gained improper access to data on 50 million Facebook users.
Likewise an accident involving an Uber Technologies Inc  car on Monday which resulted in the first fatality involving a fully autonomous vehicle further weighed on sentiment around tech.
""There certainly are some stocks where valuations look somewhat stretched ... so we're focusing our exposure within the technology sector on the cheaper end of the market,"" Mike Bell, global market strategist at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) Asset Management, said. 
""We're a bit more cautious on the more expensive and some of the more popular names in the sector,"" Bell added.
Though tech was a weight, Asian shares recovered to end in positive territory thanks to a rise in health stocks.
The UK's FTSE 100 (FTSE) index slightly outperformed the broader European market, up 0.1 percent, as investors cheered a transition deal reached between Britain and the European Union on Monday.
The British pound  was last at $1.4055.
However, gains were muted as investors braced for new Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's first policy meeting starting later in the day and amid concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump could impose additional protectionist trade measures. 
""Investors lightened their positions ahead of the Fed's policy meeting. The markets are completely split on whether the Fed will project three rate hikes this year or four,"" said Hiroaki Mino, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities.
In addition, worries about the potential for a trade war cast a shadow after U.S. President Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum.
The Trump administration is also expected to unveil up to $60 billion in new tariffs on Chinese imports by Friday, targeting technology, telecommunications and intellectual property, two officials briefed on the matter said Monday.
U.S. businesses were alarmed with several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT), on Monday urging Trump not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China.
While long-term U.S. bond yields were muted, short-dated yields rose ahead of an expected rate hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve after its two-day policy meeting starting on Tuesday.
The yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 2.857 percent (US10YT=RR), 10 basis points below the four-year high of 2.957 percent touched a month ago.
But the yield on two-year notes (US2YT=RR) hit a 9 1/2-year high of 2.32 percent on Monday as the Fed appears set to bump up its policy interest rates  to 1.50-1.75 percent from the current 1.25-1.50 percent.
Still, with a Fed rate rise already fully priced in, the dollar barely gained from the prospect of a rate hike. 
The euro (EUR=) moderated gains, rising to $1.2341 after bouncing on Monday following a Reuters report that European Central Bank officials were shifting their debate from bond purchases to the expected path of interest rates.
The yen was little changed at 106.37 per dollar , with traders wary of any new developments in a cronyism scandal that has eroded support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
Oil prices edged slightly higher as investors remained wary of growing crude supply although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran provided some support. 
Brent crude futures (LCOc1) traded at $66.47 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures (CLc1) were $62.66 a barrel.

335,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 01:10PM ET</span>",Privacy issues emerge as major business risk for Facebook,"By Salvador Rodriguez, David Ingram and Douglas Busvine
SAN FRANCISCO/ FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) faces substantial business risks from new European Union privacy rules set to take effect in May, a looming reality that came into stark relief over the weekend with revelations that a controversial political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook users.
Privacy experts said the disclosure that a researcher had sold Facebook data collected via a personality quiz to the consulting firm Cambridge Analytica is a prime example of the kinds of practices that the new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, is supposed to prevent or punish.
The danger faced by Facebook going forward is two-fold: Complying with the rules means letting European users opt out of the highly targeted online ads that have made Facebook a money machine. Violating GDPR mandates could subject the California company to fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenues.
Had the Cambridge Analytica incident happened after GDPR becomes law on May 25, it ""would have cost Facebook 4 percent of their global revenue"", said Austrian privacy campaigner and Facebook critic Max Schrems. Because a UK company was involved and because at least some of the people whose data was misused were almost certainly European, GDPR would have applied.
Shares in Facebook fell on Monday by 7 percent, their biggest drop since 2014, wiping nearly $40 billion off the value of the firm founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg.
Schrems first raised concerns in 2011 about how easy it would be for third-party apps to harvest data from the unwitting friends of Facebook users. Facebook says it has tightened its controls on such practices since it discovered the alleged abuses by Cambridge Analytica in 2015.
Schrems has founded a non-profit, called None Of Your Business (NOYB), that is hiring lawyers and exploring avenues for ""strategic litigation"" over GDPR privacy violations.
According to whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who formerly worked with Cambridge Analytica, the consulting firm used the data to help then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.
‚ÄúThe fact of the matter is that Facebook lost control of the data and wasn't adequately monitoring what third-parties were doing,"" said Scott Vernick, a partner and an expert in privacy and data security at the Philadelphia law firm Fox Rothschild. 
Vernick said the maximum GDPR fine could come into play in an incident like this because of the number of users affected and what appears to have been inadequate monitoring of third-party data practices.
Facebook said it changed its policies in 2014 to ""to give much less data, especially about friends,"" Facebook Vice President Andrew Bosworth said in a Facebook post on Monday. 
""We conduct a robust review to identify potential policy violations and to assess whether the app has a legitimate use for the data,"" the company said on Monday. ""We actually reject a significant number of apps through this process.‚Äù
Compliance with GDPR rules could cost Facebook a significant amount of money.  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) analysts in January estimated that Facebook‚Äôs overall revenue could be lowered by 4 percent in a scenario in which 30 percent of EU users opt out of targeted ads, reducing the effectiveness and likely price of ads shown by 50 percent.
The EU represents 24 percent of Facebook's ad revenue, so multiplying those figures, the bank said the regulations could have a 4 percent impact on overall Facebook revenue.
""If this regulatory approach spreads to other countries or if GDPR ever becomes more onerous over the medium or long term, it would pose more risk,"" Deutsche Bank warned.
The firestorm over Cambridge Analytica has prompted a furious response from lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, raising the prospect of just such an expansion of privacy protections.
Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser reiterated his 'sell' rating on Facebook after the weekend reports. Wieser expressed concerns that the company's regulatory risks would intensify and that its sophisticated use of data in advertising was in jeopardy.
A December 2017 survey found that only 21 percent of European consumers know what GDPR is. But after the regulation was explained, 82 percent of respondents said they plan to exercise their new rights, according to the survey of 7,000 Europeans conducted by Cambridge, Mass.-based Pegasystems Inc, which makes sales and marketing software.
PageFair, an Irish startup that helps websites deliver targeted ads without using personal data, estimates that only 3 percent of European social media users will opt-in to targeted ads, a potentially ""devastating"" blow for Facebook and other platforms, says Johnny Ryan, PageFair's head of ecosystem. 
GIVING CONSUMERS CONTROL
The quandary for Facebook is readily apparent from a video it began showing customers in February: it teaches people how to delete their accounts.
GDPR gives users the right to access their data, delete it or transfer it to competing companies. Social networks will also need to regain Europeans' consent every time they want to use their data in new ways, including for targeted advertising.
Lawmakers had social networks in mind when drafting GDPR, said Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner of Ireland, which is the lead GDPR regulator for numerous tech companies including Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD).
""There was very big consideration of these newer types of platforms,"" she told Reuters.
Tough European rules stand in sharp contrast to the lack of privacy regulation in the United States and many other countries, raising the prospect that Facebook will begin to look much different from one country to the next.
For example, the social media giant in 2017 released new artificial intelligence features that detect when a user is at risk of suicide or when someone else uploads a picture of their face.
The company did not make those features available in Europe. Facebook did not specify a reason. But heightened scrutiny in Europe over such practices with GDPR looming may have been a factor.
Another challenge for social networks are GDPR provisions mandating how companies must obtain permissions. The regulation demands that requests for consent be presented ""in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.""
In other words, the days of extensive ""terms of service"" agreements written in small text will no longer pass muster in Europe, numerous data privacy lawyers told Reuters.
In practice, social network users may find themselves seeing more ""permissions screens"" and being asked to check boxes every time a social network rolls out a new feature.

That could depress usage, Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Wehner said at an investor conference last month. ""Whenever you walk people through permission screens, there's some potential that people decide they're not going to use the product,"" Wehner said. ""We don't think it will be big, but there could be some implication there.""(This version of the story was refiled to correct description of PageFair's business in 19th paragraph)

336,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 08:01PM ET</span>",United Airlines image bruised after latest round of PR fiascos,"By Alana Wise
NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Airlines is struggling to repair its badly bruised public image after the death of a puppy onboard one of its flights reignited public debate about the airline's customer service failures.
United faces possible action by the U.S. Congress, as well as federal and local authorities, along with criticism from passengers after the latest in a series of public relations blunders by the third largest U.S. air carrier. 
The most recent incident involved the death of a French bulldog, Kokito, that died last week after a United flight attendant insisted that the puppy's carrying case be stored in the plane's overhead locker during a 3-1/2-hour flight.
Federal and local authorities are trying to determine if there are grounds for legal action in the dog's death, and lawmakers have introduced a bill to Congress that would direct the Federal Aviation Administration to prohibit storing live animals in overhead compartments and establish civil fines for violations.
The district attorneys offices in Harris County, Texas, where the flight originated, and Queens County, New York, where the flight landed, are probing the incident. Both the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Department of Agriculture are also involved. 
Social media users have threatened to boycott the airline, with thousands of tweets and re-tweets employing the hashtags #BoycottUnited and #BoycottUnitedAirlines to warn against flying on the carrier. 
""You can't talk your way out of a situation you behaved your way into,"" Anthony D'Angelo, national chair of the Public Relations Society of America, said. 
D'Angelo pointed to United's immediate but short public apology to Kokito's owners and other customer relations mishaps, including a mixup last week that led to a Kansas family's dog being shipped to Japan, as evidence of the type of bad headlines that can lead to a reputational ""death by a thousand cuts.""
""Unless there is a concerted and proactive effort... customers could start asking what's going on. Stockholders could. Legislators could. The board could. At some point you could see some executive changes.""
Last April, the careers of some United executives looked in danger after video was published of Chicago O'Hare airport aviation police dragging a bloodied 69-year-old Vietnamese-American doctor from his seat and down the aisle of a parked United plane in order to make room for airline employees. 
That incident, and a fumbled initial apology from United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz, prompted severe criticism of the carrier for its customer service shortfalls. 
A Morning Consult poll at the time found that 40 percent of respondents said they would spend more time and money to avoid flying the airline. 
Pressure has grown on Chief Executive Munoz in the months since to improve customer-carrier relations, and the negative headlines have revealed a number of customer complaints still to be addressed.
'THINK TWICE'
These incidents have attracted the attention of federal legislators to a sector that has operated fairly autonomously since the airline industry deregulation in the 1970's. 
After the incident involving the passenger being dragged from the plane, a bill was introduced to the U.S. Congress that would make it illegal for an airline to eject an already-boarded passenger from a flight and require airlines to promptly refund passengers if they do not receive the service they have paid for.
The death of the dog Kokito last week prompted two U.S. senators to introduce the ""Welfare of Our Furry Friends Act"", or ""WOOFF"" bill that would impose civil fines for stowing animals in a plane's overhead.
""I would think that anyone that has to travel with United is going to think twice now,"" Dan Rene, senior vice president of Levick public relations firm, said. 
While industry consolidation has limited the number of options U.S. customers have in choosing an airline, Rene warned that United's repeated missteps could even turn cost-sensitive customers off its brand. 
That could lead to severed partnerships with other corporations as fewer businesses want to associate with a brand they view as toxic. 
""They have to show that they actually care about their customers, and in this case their customer could be on four legs instead of two,"" Rene said. United needs to ""own their current mistakes and talk about what they're doing to make sure it doesn't happen again.""
After last year's passenger ejection, United announced changes to the way it would compensate passengers who willingly give up their seats on overbooked flights. 
And starting next month, United said it will issue brightly colored bag tags to passengers traveling with in-cabin pets to help flight attendants easily identify the animals.

United declined to comment further on the rash of incidents.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2018 04:28AM ET</span>",'Socially responsible' investors reassess Facebook ownership,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With European and U.S. lawmakers calling for investigations into reports that Facebook user data was accessed by UK based consultancy Cambridge Analytica to help President Donald Trump win the 2016 election, investors are asking even more questions about the social media company's operations. 
An increasingly vocal base of investors who put their money where their values are had already started to sour on Facebook, one of the market's tech darlings.
Facebook's shares closed down nearly 7.0 percent on Monday, wiping nearly $40 billion off its market value as investors worried that potential legislation could damage the company's advertising business.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg is facing calls from lawmakers to explain how the political consultancy gained improper access to data on 50 million Facebook users.
Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denies the media claims and said it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party application in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.
""The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook's data practices, and the picture is not pretty,"" said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley's use of data.
The scrutiny presents a fresh threat to Facebook's reputation, which is already under attack over Russia's alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.
""We do have some concerns,"" said Ron Bates, portfolio manager on the $131 million 1919 Socially Responsive Balanced Fund, a Facebook shareholder.
""The big issue of the day around customer incidents and data is something that has been discussed among ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) investors for some time and has been a concern.""
Bates said he is encouraged by the fact that the company has acknowledged the privacy issues and is responding, and thinks it remains an appropriate investment for now.
Facebook said on Monday it had hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to carry out a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica and the company had agreed to comply and give the forensics firm complete access to their servers and systems.
""What would be a deal-breaker for us would be if we saw this recurring and we saw significant risk to the consumer around privacy,"" said Bates.
More than $20 trillion globally is allocated toward ""responsible"" investment strategies in 2016, a figure that grew by a quarter from just two years prior, according to Global Sustainable Investment Alliance, an advocacy group.
New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees $193 billion in city pension fund assets, said in a statement to Reuters on Monday that, ""as investors in Facebook, we're closely following what are very alarming reports.""
Sustainalytics BV, a widely used research service that rates companies on their ESG performance for investors, told Reuters on Monday it is reviewing its Facebook rating, which is currently ""average.""
""We're definitely taking a look at it to see if there should be some change,"" said Matthew Barg, research manager at Sustainalytics.
""Their business model is so closely tied to having access to consumer data and building off that access. You want to see that they understand that and care about that.""
ESG investors had already expressed concerns about Facebook before media reports that Cambridge Analytica harvested the private data on Facebook users to develop techniques to support Trump's presidential campaign.
Wall Street investors, including ESG funds, have ridden the tech sector to record highs in recent months, betting on further outsized returns from stocks including Facebook, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.
Jennifer Sireklove, director of responsible investing at Seattle-based Parametric, a money manager with $200 billion in assets, said an increasing number of ethics-focused investors were avoiding Facebook and other social media companies, even before the most recent reports about privacy breaches. 
Parametric held a call with clients on Friday to discuss concerns about investing in social media companies overall, including Google. 

""More investors are starting to question whether these companies are contributing to a fair and well-informed public marketplace, or are we becoming all the more fragmented because of the ways in which these companies are operating,"" she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday rejected BlackBerry Ltd's request to dismiss a lawsuit claiming it inflated its stock price and defrauded shareholders by painting a misleadingly positive picture of sales prospects for its BlackBerry 10 smartphones.
While an earlier version of the case was dismissed in March 2015, Chief Judge Colleen McMahon of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan said the proposed class action can proceed now.
She said new information about BlackBerry's alleged conduct had surfaced during the criminal prosecution of an executive at a retailer that sold its smartphones.
The judge also cited a new legal standard adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court that could make it easier for some plaintiffs to show that statements of opinion might be misleading.
Other defendants include former Chief Executive Thorsten Heins, former Chief Financial Officer Brian Bidulka and Chief Legal Officer Steve Zipperstein.
BlackBerry spokeswoman Sarah McKinney declined to comment.
A lawyer for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The BlackBerry 10 won positive reviews from critics, but never caught on with the public, which preferred Android-based phones and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's iPhone. BlackBerry decided in 2016 to stop making its own smartphones. 
Shareholders had accused BlackBerry of concealing BlackBerry 10's true sales prospects in public statements during 2013.
The amended complaint was based in part on information from the 2015 prosecution of James Dunham, a former chief operating officer at the retailer Wireless Zone.
That case revealed how an April 2013 report by Detwiler Fenton showing a high return rate for the BlackBerry 10 was based on data sold by Dunham from some 400 Wireless Zone stores.
Dunham pleaded guilty to selling confidential wireless industry information and was sentenced to five months in prison.
McMahon said the plaintiffs have made a ""plausible showing"" that BlackBerry's public response to the Detwiler report, including that customers were ""satisfied"" and return rates were ""at or below our forecasts and right in line with the industry,"" contradicted data it allegedly had from Wireless Zone.

She said she would address later the merits of BlackBerry's arguments that its statements were not misleading.

344,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 05:00PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com - Here‚Äôs a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Tech Wreak, Trump Watch in Focus
With nothing of note on the U.S. economic calendar Tuesday, investors are expected to continue to focus on the fallout in the tech sector after a nearly 7% slump in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) amid calls for increased regulation of social media platforms.
Facebook took swift action to allay investor fears after it confirmed it hired a firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica ‚Äì the firm alleged to have gained data from 50 million Facebook profiles to influence the 2016 U.S. elections.
Fears of increased regulation weighed on shares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP).
US President Trump, meanwhile, revealed on Monday his plan to combat opioid crisis which included the support for research into developing a vaccine for opioid addiction.
That did little to divert investor attention from Trump‚Äôs ‚Äútwitter meltdown,‚Äù over the weekend involving a series of accusatory tweets against special counsel Robert Mueller as the latter‚Äôs probe into alleged ties between Trump‚Äôs 2016 presidential campaign and Russia intensified.
The Dow closed more than 300 points lower on Monday.
2. API to Confirm Fifth-Straight Weekly Build in Crude Supplies?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday.
The American Petroleum Institute reported last week crude oil stockpiles rose by 1.156 million barrels. That was well below the 5.022 million barrels the Energy Information Administration reported during the same period.
Crude oil futures made a timid start to the week start settling at $62.06 a barrels, down 28 cents, as OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said Monday that despite improving conditions in the oil market, global inventories remained above the 5-year average.
Yet, offsetting the negative sentiment on oil prices somewhat was the prospect of a tick higher in Middle East geopolitical tensions as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman is expected to up the ante against Iran on his visit to the United States this week.
3. Bitcoin to Continue Rebound?
Investors are likely to watch bitcoin‚Äôs rebound closely to gauge whether the popular digital currency can continue its rebound from a low of $7,240 on Sunday.
Bitcoin held most of its gains on Monday despite a momentary selloff on news that US President Donald Trump had signed an executive order banning any transaction within the United States involving any digital currency that was issued by the Government of Venezuela on or after January 9, 2018.
The rise in bitcoin comes amid relief that the G20 meeting, which got underway in Argentina Monday, is unlikely to be used as a platform to discuss plans of a coordinated regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies.
Ahead of the G20 meeting, Bank of England governor Mark Carney said ‚Äúcrypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability at this time.""
Bitcoin rose 9.83% to $8383.4 on Monday."

Earlier this month, Kroger joined other U.S. retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc (N:DKS) to bar the sale of firearms to those under 21, following a deadly shooting at a Florida high school.
Fred Meyer said it was working on plans to phase out sales of firearms and ammunition. 
""This is a victory for communities and for common sense. And it's a positive step for our pension fund beneficiaries and for public safety,"" New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city's public pension funds, said in a statement. Stringer said he had called for Kroger to cease selling firearms last year.
Several large money management firms that own shares in gun makers, including BlackRock Inc (N:BLK), the world's largest asset manager, and  State Street  Corp (N:STT), have felt the heat following the Florida massacre and have sought answers from gun makers and distributors.
Fred Meyer said the firearm business generated about $7 million annually, while it also highlighted ""softening consumer demand."" 

Fred Meyer operates 133 stores in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington and sells firearms in 43 of them.

(Reuters) - The top U.S. rail regulator has asked major railroads for information on service levels before meeting disgruntled shippers and other customers over complaints about service delays and higher costs.
In letters to the chief executive officers of the railroads dated March 16 that were posted on the U.S. Surface Transportation Board's (STB) website on Monday, the regulator requested locomotive and employee numbers, and asked whether the railroads have sufficient numbers of each to meet demand.
The STB said last week it would start meeting with customers next month, signaling the agency could be open to new paths to relieve shipper pain.
The letter signed by STB acting chairman Ann Begeman and vice chairman Deb Miller cites the regulator's ""increasing concerns regarding service across the rail network,"" and asks for a service outlook for the near term and for 2018.
""Please discuss your expectations for service demand in 2018, ability to serve this demand, and whether internal projections for demand in 2018 have been accurate based on actual volumes year-to-date,"" the letters said, among other requests.
The letters were sent to the CEOs of  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP), Warren Buffett's BNSF Railway Co (N:BRKa), CSX Corp (O:CSX).  Norfolk Southern  Corp (N:NSC) and Kansas City Southern (N:KSU). They were also sent to the CEOs of Canada's two major railroads, Canadian National Railway Co (TO:CNR) and  Canadian Pacific Railway  Ltd (TO:CP), which have significant U.S. operations. 
Representatives of these railroads did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The STB's last major public hearing was in October and focused on service issues at No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX.
As U.S. economic growth has revved up, railroads and truck fleets have not expanded capacity to keep pace - a decision applauded by Wall Street. 
The drive for cost cuts and higher margins at U.S. trucking and railroad operators is pinching their biggest customers, forcing the likes of  General Mills  Inc (N:GIS) and  Hormel Foods Corp  (N:HRL) to spend more on deliveries and consider raising their own prices as a way to pass along the costs.

361,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 04:30PM ET</span>",Corporate America Warns Trump Against Broad-Based China Tariffs,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. companies from Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). are warning President Donald Trump that any sweeping trade action against China could raise consumer prices, increase costs for businesses and hurt stock prices.
Broad-based tariffs on Chinese goods would ‚Äútrigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the U.S. economy,‚Äù a coalition of more than 40 business groups led by the Information Technology Industry Council said Sunday in a letter to the president. The coalition includes groups representing retailers and makers of everything from toys to wine, while the council represents companies including Amazon, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.‚Äôs Google,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT).
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is leading an investigation into China‚Äôs treatment of American intellectual property, and is expected in the coming weeks to hand over its recommendations to address any unfair practices to President Donald Trump. The administration is said to be considering wide-ranging tariffs on everything from consumer electronics to shoes and clothing made in China, according to people familiar with the matter. The administration is said to be considering targeting at least $30 billion of Chinese imports.
After Bloomberg News earlier this month reported the options being considered, Trump tweeted that ‚Äúthe U.S. is acting swiftly on intellectual property theft. We cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years!‚Äù
Electronics, Clothing
Tariffs on electronics, clothing and other products would raise prices for consumers and businesses, negating gains from the tax cuts passed by Congress late last year, the business coalition said. Such measures could also hurt U.S. companies that sell components of products exported from China, as well as raising input costs for American manufacturers, the coalition said.
‚ÄúThe administration is right to focus on the negative economic impact of China‚Äôs industrial policies and unfair trade practices, but the U.S. Chamber would strongly disagree with a decision to impose sweeping tariffs,‚Äù U.S. Chamber of Commerce chief executive officer Thomas Donohue said in a statement. ‚ÄúSimply put, tariffs are damaging taxes on American consumers.‚Äù
Slapping tariffs on imports of information and communications technology products from China would reduce U.S. investment in innovation and lower productivity growth, according to a report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Tariffs of 10 percent would reduce U.S, output by $163 billion over the next decade, while a 25 percent penalty would curb output by $332 billion over the same period, according to the foundation.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad they think it‚Äôs a big problem, because we‚Äôve been saying this for years,‚Äù Robert Atkinson, president of the ITIF, said of USTR‚Äôs focus on China‚Äôs alleged disregard for U.S. IP. ‚ÄúWith the tariff approach, I worry that the Chinese could effectively retaliate, for example by going after some key U.S. exports to China, like aviation.‚Äù
USTR has argued that China uses a range of practices to force companies to transfer IP, and Chinese entities engage in widespread theft of U.S. trade secrets, as it seeks to become a leader in advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence. U.S. businesses in China have long complained about being forced to hand over technology as the price of gaining access to the market."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has awarded a record $83 million to three whistleblowers tied to a 2016 settlement with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Corp‚Äôs Merrill Lynch brokerage unit, the whistleblowers' attorney said on Monday.
The SEC announced the size of the awards on Monday but did not say which case led it to pay two whistleblowers $50 million and a third $33 million. A law firm representing the whistleblowers said their clients tipped off the agency to the misuse of customer funds by the brokerage.
""Our clients represent the very best of Wall Street and feel vindicated by the SEC‚Äôs determination,"" Jordan Thomas, a partner at Labaton Sucharow, said in a statement. ""By coming forward, these courageous executives protected millions of Merrill Lynch‚Äôs customers.""
Merrill Lynch admitted in the $415 million settlement to wrongdoing in misusing customer cash by holding up to $58 billion a day in a clearing account when it should have been held in reserve. The SEC also said the company engaged in complex options trades to artificially reduce the amount of reserve cash it must hold for customers.
The activities, spanning 2009 to 2015, freed up billions of dollars per week and allowed Merrill Lynch to finance the firm‚Äôs trading activities for part of that time. 
Merrill Lynch had said in a statement at the time that no customers were harmed and no losses were incurred, and that it would dedicate significant resources to reviewing and enhancing its processes. A spokesman declined to comment further on Monday.
The SEC has awarded more than $262 million to 53 whistleblowers since it began issuing the awards in 2012. Anyone who provides the SEC information that leads to sanctions in excess of $1 million can receive 10 percent to 30 percent of the money collected.

""We hope that these awards encourage others with specific, high-quality information regarding securities laws violations to step forward and report it to the SEC,"" said Jane Norberg, chief of the SEC's Office of the Whistleblower, in a statement on Monday.

374,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Tech stocks wobble in U.S.; some investors worry party is ending,"By Noel Randewich and David Randall
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A deep sell-off across technology companies on Monday on U.S. stock markets left some investors worrying how much longer those high-flying stocks' market leadership would last.
Wall Street has ridden the tech sector to record highs in recent months, betting on further outsized returns from stocks like Apple, Facebook and Alphabet. The sell-off, which bled into the wider market, was sparked by social network Facebook's regulatory troubles, but that was not alone in rattling investors.
A potential slowdown in acquisitions, threats of disruption in Apple's (O:AAPL) supply chain and worries about broader government oversight were also behind selling in technology shares, many of which have been trading at historically high earnings multiples.
""If (tech stocks) start to decay, then it may leave investors wondering what's left to become the new leader to resume the bulls' advance,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
Facebook (O:FB) fell 6.6 percent and was on track for its worst session since 2014 after European and U.S. lawmakers called for investigations into reports that a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's campaign gained access to data on 50 million Facebook users.
Jennifer Sireklove, director of responsible investing at Seattle-based Parametric, a money manager with $200 billion in assets, said that an increasing number of ethics-focused investors were avoiding Facebook and other social media companies, even before the most recent reports about privacy breaches. Parametric held a call with clients on Friday to discuss concerns about investing in social media companies overall, including Google. 
""More investors are starting to question whether these companies are contributing to a fair and well-informed public marketplace, or are we becoming all the more fragmented because of the ways in which these companies are operating,"" she said.
Along with Facebook, technology heavyweights behind much of the recent stock market rally also fell, with Alphabet (O:GOOGL), Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Netflix (O:NFLX) and Microsoft (O:MSFT) all tumbling 2 percent or more. 
CALL FOR HEARINGS
""A lot of the high-growth tech stories from 2017 are starting to break down. Semis are clearly now at risk of trade wars. M&A was a big supporter of the group, and that story is crumbling,"" said Joel Kulina, a trader at Wedbush. 
Reflecting mounting concerns about how technology companies share personal user data, two U.S. senators called for congressional hearings to question Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg and also the heads of Twitter and Alphabet's Google.
""If you regulate Facebook, what's to say that wouldn't have a domino effect? Google, maybe Uber?,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""People have thought right now the tech growth rate has no boundaries, no ceiling. Today people are beginning to question that."" 
Outsized returns delivered by the largest technology stocks have made them heroes on Wall Street, but some strategists have warned that investors' reliance on them exacerbates the risk of a steep downturn.
The S&P 500 information technology index recently traded at a relatively expensive 18.8 times expected earnings, 12 percent above its 15-year average, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. The index has gained 31 percent over the past 12 months.

‚ÄúMost of the weakness is centered around tech. Tech has outperformed so dramatically this year,"" Robert Phipps, Director, Per Stirling Capital Management, Austin, Texas. ""It hasn't backed off when other sectors have. So it needed some catalyst to adjust down some.""

BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday declared a mistrial in the case of four former employees of a firm that advises companies on shareholder votes charged with participating in a scheme to pay bribes to learn how a proxy adviser's clients voted.
U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston ordered the mistrial due to a medical issue involving the wife of one of the 12 jurors hearing the case against the former employees of Georgeson LLC, a proxy solicitation firm owned by Computershare Ltd.
The four ex-Georgeson employees, Michael Sedlak, Donna Ackerly, Charles Garske and Richard Gottcent, have pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and honest services wire fraud charges. 
Prosecutors had been expected on Monday to finish presenting their case after three weeks of trial. While three defendants consented to going forward with just 11 jurors, prosecutors were only willing to do so if all four agreed to that option.
David Spears, a lawyer for Sedlak, said that given the prosecution's decision, he would seek to prevent a retrial given the U.S. Constitution's general prohibition against being tried twice for the same crime, known as double jeopardy.
""The government's refusal to go forward with our clients after we consented is insupportable,"" Spears said.
A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling confirmed the mistrial but declined further comment.
The trial came after Georgeson in November agreed to pay $4.5 million and enter into a deferred prosecution agreement to resolve charges that it conspired to bribe an employee of proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services.
Prosecutors said Brian Bennett from 2007 to 2012 used his job at ISS to supply Sedlak with information in exchange for concert and sports tickets worth $14,000, including for baseball games and U2 and Jay-Z concerts.
Sedlak forwarded the information to Ackerly, Garske, Gottcent and another Georgeson employee, Keith Haynes, prosecutors said.
Ackerly and Garske then arranged for clients to be billed for some of the bribes using false descriptions like ""courier services,"" prosecutors said. 
The goal, prosecutors said, was to gain an illegal edge in their work helping companies shape strategies that could affect the outcome of shareholder votes. 
The defendants denied wrongdoing and contended the information was not confidential.

Bennett and Haynes testified for the prosecution after pleading guilty. ISS in 2013 paid $300,000 to resolve U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges it failed to safeguard client information.

377,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 02:40PM ET</span>",United Tech CEO plans exit after Rockwell integration: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (N:UTX) Chief Executive Officer Greg Hayes is planning to leave following completion of the company's integration with Rockwell Collins Inc (N:COL), Bloomberg reported on Monday.
Hayes has discussed a plan with the company's board to leave after the integration, which is expected to take about three years, according to the report. (https://bloom.bg/2ICl4YP)
He could stay as long as five years, depending on the pace of the merger and whether  United Tech  pursues the breakup it promised to explore later this year, Bloomberg reported.
United Tech, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines, had said last month it was exploring a breakup of its business portfolio, including jet engines, elevators and air conditioners.
The company had struck a $30 billion deal to buy avionics and interiors maker Rockwell Collins last year.
United Tech shares have lagged the broader market under Hayes as the company spent heavily on developing the new fuel-saving geared turbofan engine and as sales of Otis elevators were pressured due to a supply glut in China.
The company's shares were down 1.1 percent at $126.90 in afternoon trade on Monday, compared to a 1.5 pct decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJI).

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany's appointment of a Goldman Sachs (N:GS) executive to a senior finance ministry post on Monday drew accusations the government was once again cosying up to the banking sector that caused the 2008 economic crash.
Joerg Kukies, formerly the co-head of Goldman Sachs in Germany, was named deputy finance minister with responsibility for financial market policy and European issues, the ministry said.
It is the first time a German government has hired a Goldman Sachs banker and signals a recovery of the sector's influence after the crash when it was shunned by politicians including Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Prior to that, Germany had a long tradition of using bankers to help steer the economy. In the 1950s, chancellor Konrad Adenauer sent  Deutsche Bank  chief Hermann Josef Abs, rather than his finance minister, to negotiations over pre-war debt. Decades later, Helmut Kohl was advised by another Deutsche CEO, Alfred Herrhausen, on third-world debt and industrial policy.
But Goldman Sachs is viewed by many Germans as a symbol of a more cut-throat Anglo-Saxon capitalism, especially since a former executive in the country said banks had ""no obligation to promote the welfare of the public"".
Lawmakers skeptical of Kukies' appointment, under Social Democrat (SPD) Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, fear the appointment could anger voters who have turned away from mainstream parties in favor of the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD).
""Such revolving door cases multiply distrust of citizens towards politics,"" said Sven Giegold, a Greens member of the European Parliament. 
Timo Lange of Lobby Control, which campaigns for transparency in lobbying, said the appointment ""strengthens the impression that politicians and the elite are working hand in hand and that there is little left for the ordinary person."" 
The elevation of a Goldman Sachs executive comes as rival Deutsche Bank (DE:DBKGn) is struggling to rebuild its influence years after it was at the heart of German industrial and economic policy as part of a network of politicians and bankers known as ""Deutschland AG"".
Much of that network unraveled during the 1990s and early 2000s as Deutsche Bank sold down its various stakes. 
Former chancellor Helmut Schmidt said in 2011: ""Deutsche Bank is no longer German"".
Kukies joined Goldman Sachs in 2001, working in Frankfurt and London, often profiting from deals which resulted from the dismantling of Deutschland AG. He worked in fixed income, equities and structured products, and in his new post will be responsible for financial market policy.
Fabio De Masi, a lawmaker with the leftist Linke party, said: ""Olaf Scholz is imitating Donald Trump by putting the arsonist in the fire brigade.""

Kukies' appointment coincides with a gathering momentum in Frankfurt where Goldman Sachs will be expanding its presence as Britain prepares to leave the European Union.

390,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 09:44PM ET</span>",Dropbox IPO oversubscribed: sources,"(Reuters) - Cloud storage company Dropbox Inc's initial public offering was oversubscribed, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday, indicating healthy demand for the first big tech IPO this year even as tech stocks opened the week on sour note.
While investor appetite looked encouraging with three days to go before final pricing, it was not clear if that would be strong enough to lift the deal above of the initial range of $16 to $18 a share that Dropbox set last week. The offering is expected to price Thursday, and the stock will start trading on the Nasdaq on Friday.
""It is early to predict the pricing. But what I can say is that from the conversations it seems the market is interested in it and IPO seems to be bright,"" a separate source told Reuters. The three sources asked not to be named as the IPO pricing process was still underway.
Dropbox's IPO comes in what is sizing up to be a challenging week for stocks, with the U.S. Federal Reserve set to raise interest rates on Wednesday, a day before the Dropbox deal is set to close.
Tech shares also fell hard to open the week, with Nasdaq down more than 2 percent on reports of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's latest data privacy problems.
Dropbox's IPO also comes on the heels of an upsized deal last week from cyber security firm Zscaler Inc and is being watched as a barometer of investor enthusiasm for tech unicorns - young companies valued at more than $1 billion - after Snapchat owner Snap Inc's shares cratered following a much-touted IPO a year ago.
Dropbox and existing stockholders are selling 36 million shares, and the offering could be increased by 5.4 million if underwriters exercise their right to buy more stock. At the high end of the indicated pricing, it could raise nearly $650 million, making it the largest tech IPO since Snap hit the market just over a year ago.
""The book is oversubscribed, with very good quality,"" one of the sources said.
The current price range suggests the San Francisco company, co-founded in 2007 by Andrew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, will hit the public market valued at roughly $7 billion, a hefty discount to the $10 billion implied by its last funding round in 2014.
Houston is the largest shareholder and will retain 24 percent of Dropbox after selling 2.3 million shares in the offering. Sequoia Capital is the largest shareholder among outside investors, with about a 25 percent stake.

The company has 500 million users and competes with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and has Box Inc as its main rival.

(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) said on Monday it had agreed to settle a U.S. labor board case on whether the company is accountable for its franchisees' alleged labor law violations.
The settlement, which must be approved by a National Labor Relations Board judge, would allow McDonald's to avoid a ruling that it is a ""joint employer"" of workers at McDonald's franchises and can be held liable when franchisees violate federal labor law.
McDonald's, which did not admit to any wrongdoing in the settlement, said in a statement that it was pleased to resolve the claims. 
""While the settlement is not yet final, we believe this is a major first step in ending this wasteful multi-year litigation,"" the company said. 
The exact terms of the settlement were not immediately clear. 
Business groups had said that a ruling against McDonald's could upend the franchising model by making franchisors more vulnerable to lawsuits and requiring them to bargain with unions representing franchise workers.
Illinois-based McDonald's and the office of NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb presented the settlement to an administrative judge at a hearing in New York. 
Union-backed worker advocacy group Fight for $15 filed dozens of legal claims on behalf of McDonald's workers beginning in 2012. The group said workers across the United States were fired for taking part in protests calling for higher wages. 
The judge had agreed in January to pause the trial against McDonald's that began in 2015 so that Robb, an appointee of President Donald Trump, could pursue settlement talks with the company.
Fight for $15 lawyer Micah Wissinger said the group would object to the proposed settlement. 
""In a real settlement, McDonald‚Äôs would take responsibility for illegally firing and harassing workers fighting to get off food stamps and out of poverty,"" he said.
The case was seen as an important test of how a 2015 NLRB decision that had rankled business groups by making it easier to prove that a company is a joint employer would apply to franchisees. 
In December, a new Republican majority on the board overturned the 2015 decision and said only companies with direct control over workers may be considered joint employers.

Last month, the board said its December ruling was invalid because NLRB member William Emanuel, a Trump appointee, had a conflict of interest. Emanuel's former law firm represented a staffing agency involved in the 2015 NLRB case.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) announced on Monday that it plans to invest $340 million to build a new sport utility vehicle at its Chattanooga, Tennessee, plant in the United States as demand surges for larger vehicles.
It will build a five-passenger SUV that will be branded as part of the company's Atlas family. A concept version will be unveiled next week at the New York International Auto Show, the German carmaker said in a statement.
""We are not only committed to this market, we are committed to our U.S. manufacturing home in Chattanooga, Tennessee,"" it said.
Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam said Volkswagen in Chattanooga had grown ""from a single vehicle producer, starting with the Passat, into what it is today - a thriving U.S. manufacturing operation that can produce three models, and counting.""
The investment announcement is positive news for the U.S. car industry at a time when it is bracing for the impact of higher steel and aluminum tariffs on metal produced outside North America. Haslam told reporters last week the tariffs could add costs to manufacturers, especially automakers, that could be ""very harmful.""
VW said in February that 54 percent of its total own-brand volume sales were SUVs. In addition to a new seven-passenger Atlas that went on sale last year, VW also unveiled an all-new 2018 Tiguan SUV last year. Prior to 2017, most of VW's U.S. own-brand sales were cars.

VW is still working to improve its image in the United States after it admitted to cheating on diesel emissions tests in 2015, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history.

407,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 02:02PM ET</span>",ADM restructures business groups as grain margins falter,"By P.J. Huffstutter and Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co said on Monday that it would restructure its business units, as the U.S. agricultural merchant seeks ways to remain competitive in the face of persistent tight margins in the global grains sector.
ADM and rival grain merchants such as Bunge Ltd and Cargill Inc have struggled as a global oversupply of food commodities has made it tough to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing, and selling corn, soy and wheat.
The companies have been trying to diversify into higher-margin sectors, such as food ingredients and aquaculture feed, to compensate for the poor returns on their traditional grain handling businesses.
Chicago-based ADM said it was shifting its business segments into four new units - carbohydrate solutions, nutrition, oilseeds and origination - to differentiate its offerings to customers.
Among other things, the shift more clearly separates the company's wheat milling and ingredients businesses from its grain-trading business.
ADM, which dates back to 1902, has in recent years also lost key traders and exited energy trading. It named a new chief growth officer last year.
Chief Executive Juan Luciano said in a statement that ADM has been trying to become a ""more agile and efficient company,"" and the reorganization will help continue that effort.
Its rivals, too, have been shaking up operations in a bid to bolster financial results.
In November, Bunge said it was reducing the number of its operating units to three from five.
Cargill overhauled its management team in 2015.
For ADM, some of these changes also date back to 2015, when it created a new business unit, Wild Flavors and Specialty Ingredients, after it bought natural flavorings company Wild for about $3 billion.
More recently, ADM has broadened its international operations in the face of the global grain glut, buying a stake in corn mills in Russia and entering a soybean joint venture with Cargill in Egypt.
ADM's pre-restructure units are agricultural services, corn processing, oilseeds processing, and Wild Flavors and specialty ingredients. 
After the restructure, most of its agricultural services operations, which include grain trading, will be housed in an origination unit that will be led by Stefano Rettore. Rettore left rival CHS Inc last year to become ADM's chief risk officer. 
ADM's wheat milling business, which has been in the agricultural services unit, and its corn processing division will become part of a new carbohydrates solutions segment. Chris Cuddy, who was president of corn processing, will lead the unit. 
Wild Flavors will be housed in a new nutrition unit, which will be led by Vince Macciocchi, who was formerly president of the Wild division. The oilseeds segment will remain unchanged.

ADM said its new business segments will be reflected in its financial results beginning with the first quarter of 2018, which are due on May 1.

The burgeoning bludgeoning of large-cap U.S. technology stocks on Monday has traders acutely anxious about the near-term outlook for the S&P 500 Index.
The VIX futures curve, whose contracts track the implied volatility of the benchmark U.S. stock index over time, is in backwardation. That is, March‚Äôs contract is more expensive than the second-month contract, and so on out to September.
Generally, the VIX futures curve tends to slope upward -- called contango -- a tacit acknowledgment that the outlook for U.S. equities is generally more uncertain over long rather than short time periods. Backwardation in the curve is a telltale signal that the stock market is under stress.
During the market mayhem in early February, the spread between the front- and third-month contract blew out to its lowest level since 2009.

414,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 12:20PM ET</span>","Majority of French back selling state assets in Renault, Orange, PSA: poll","PARIS (Reuters) - A majority of French voters back selling all or some of the state's assets in automakers  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), airliner Air France (PA:AIRF) and telecoms group Orange (PA:ORAN), an opinion poll showed on Monday.
France announced last year plans to sell some 10 billion euros worth of stakes in state-owned companies in order to raise money for a new fund to finance innovation, an election pledge of President Emmanuel Macron.
State stakes in big groups have long had popular backing, and the OpinionWay poll showed two thirds of voters still back it in principle.
But the survey stressed that when it comes to individual companies, a majority back selling stakes in companies that are not viewed as public services. 
Renault, at the heart of a power struggle over its ownership, topped the list, with 56 percent in favour of the state selling at least some of its 15 percent stake.
The survey showed, however, that a majority oppose the selling of state assets in mail operator La Poste and electricity provider EDF (PA:EDF). 

Responses were split about state-owned railway operator SNCF, with 50 percent opposing any asset sale and 47 percent backing it.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development sees enormous prospects in Lebanon, but potential investors need to see progress on reform and, over the border, a process towards a settlement of Syria's war, the bank's president said.
On his first visit since the EBRD began operating in Lebanon in September, EBRD President Suma Chakrabarti said he saw a role for the bank in financing small and medium-sized enterprises and renewable energy, energy efficiency and infrastructure projects.
On Thursday Lebanon agreed its first two EBRD deals: a 2.51 percent equity investment in Lebanon's largest lender Bank Audi and a $50 million trade finance line with Fransabank, the third-largest. 
""I think the prospects for the EBRD in Lebanon are enormous,"" he told Reuters, and added that the bank has not set an upper limit on investment in Lebanon. ""It depends on the demand we get from private sector players."" 
While the war in Syria continues, Lebanon's biggest challenge will remain regional risk.
""Providing (Lebanon) continues with that (economic) reform process, provided there is a process towards a settlement in Syria, I think the prospects are really good,"" Chakrabarti said.
Set up by governments in 1991 to invest in the ex-communist economies of eastern Europe and owned mainly by developed countries, the EBRD has expanded its mandate in the last decade to operate in almost 40 countries.
Lebanon joins Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia in the EBRD's southern and eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region, where it has invested more than 6.5 billion euros ($8 billion) in 170 projects since 2012. 
FUNDING DRIVE
Lebanon has one of the highest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world at about 150 percent. Growth and state revenues have been low for years, undermined by war in neighbor Syria and domestic political inertia.
To help stimulate the economy, Lebanon is seeking up to $16 billion for infrastructure this year from investors and donors. Fundraising will begin with an April 6 conference in Paris.
Chakrabarti said the EBRD will voice support for Lebanon in Paris and is keen to invest further, especially in public private partnership (PPP) projects. ""The $16 billion cannot be financed unless there are more PPPs,"" he said. 
Chakrabarti said the EBRD and other lenders will be ""very much focussed"" on how Lebanon implements promised reforms and projects. ""No-one should believe that just having a conference in Paris is a success in itself.""
CONSENSUS BUILDING 
After agreeing a president and prime minister in late 2016 after years of political paralysis, Lebanon has passed its first budget since 2005, signed it first offshore oil and gas deals and signed a long-awaited PPP law.
Chakrabarti said these developments have made him more confident ""than I would have been a couple of years ago"".
""Conversations we've had ... suggest there actually is a consensus building that more reform is going to be required."" 
Lebanon is due to hold its first parliamentary elections since 2009 in early May. They will be held under a new electoral law, making it harder to predict the outcome. 
""People are talking very openly that they don't think the parliamentary elections will derail this process. Even after the election we can expect a continued push in the right direction.""
LENDING SHOULD INCREASE
Through equity in its investment in Bank Audi, Chakrabarti said the EBRD hopes to establish itself in Lebanon's banking sector where it wants to help banks reach new customers. 
""If Lebanon is to achieve the rates of growth economic growth that it can do, lending has to increase in the medium term without a doubt,"" he said. 
A group of customers Chakrabarti is passionate about reaching is women entrepreneurs. 
""We have our Women in Business programs in 17 countries. We have learned how to do this really well,"" he said.
Chakrabarti said the EBRD can work well with Lebanon's entrepreneurial spirit and its move towards a private sector-focused development model. Lebanon's capital investment plan also focuses on EBRD strengths: energy, infrastructure and SMEs. 
Lebanon has hosted over a million refugees fleeing Syria's conflict, straining public services around the country.
Chakrabarti said the bank has been talking to the Lebanese government about projects to help host communities and refugees. But this will require donors to contribute funds alongside the EBRD's market-based loans.

Such a situation is playing out right now, as so-called growth stocks continue a prolonged stretch of dominance.
A long-short growth investment factor maintained by Goldman Sachs has returned 5% in the past month, putting it in the 98th percentile of historical monthly returns. What's more, the strategy gained 9% in 2017, its best calendar year since 2007.
With this in mind, popular intuition may suggest growth would soon give way to the so-called value trade, which involves scooping up stocks at prices deemed undervalued. After all, throughout the history of the stock market, these two strategies have alternated leadership.
In what Goldman describes as a ""surprising twist,"" such a reversal is not imminent. In fact, the firm says growth stocks have further to run.
First, despite their recent streak of outperformance, growth stocks remain attractively priced. For example, firms with long-term growth estimates of 20% to 30% are trading at a median price-to-earnings multiple of 22 times, which is in just the 58th percentile, according to Goldman data.
The second argument in favor of growth stocks is one based around a market measure called dispersion, which measures the magnitude of single-security moves compared with a benchmark index. That the measure is so tight marks another shortcoming of the value trade. For context, wider dispersion has historically preceded value outperformance.
""Unlike the growth rally in the late 1990s, which widened P/E dispersion and set the stage for value outperformance from 2000-02, today there appears to be less potential energy stored for a value stock rebound,"" David Kostin, Goldman's chief US equity strategist, wrote in a client note.
So what does this all mean for you, the investor? For starters, perhaps you should start seeking out exposure to the growth trade, if you haven't already. And if you still wish to stubbornly cling to a value trade, Goldman recommends healthcare above all other industries ‚Äî because that's where dispersion is the widest.
If you wish to stick with growth, Goldman has a 50-stock basket of companies spanning all 11 major industries. The stocks in the group are based on realized and consensus forward earnings and sales growth. Here's a five-company sampling: Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), E-Trade Financial, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX), and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU)."
425,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 11:42AM ET</span>",Apple won't quit until it owns every important part of the iPhone,"Apple is executing on a years-long strategy to own all the core technologies that go into its products.
If it's successful, it could mean that Apple could have a major advantage over Samsung (KS:005930) and other Android phone makers: features they can't copy. 
The latest project that Apple is striking out on may be its biggest yet ‚Äî it wants to design and build its own screen, according to  a new report from Bloomberg. 
Currently, Apple buys its displays from companies like Samsung. This means that while the parts that go into devices such as the iPhone X are tuned and customized, they are generally available to other companies. For example, other devices including the Samsung Galaxy S9 use OLED displays provided by Samsung. 
So Apple has built its own display manufacturing facility in California,  according to Bloomberg. This factory is dedicated to building screens using a technology called MicroLED, which is emerging and hasn't yet been used on mainstream products. Apple's hoping to use them on the Apple Watch, and current working MicroLED prototypes are brighter and have a finer level of control over colors, according to the report. 
It's sure to be a long and expensive process, but Apple can afford it. Apple currently has 300 engineers on the project, and it won't be ready for mass production for at least three years, and it could get killed before then. 
If Apple succeeds, then it will have something that no other smartphone maker can match. 
Apple's project to build its own screens is only the latest sign that the company wants to design and own every important part that goes into the iPhone.
This mission started in 2008, when Apple bought a little-known chip company called PA Semi. That technology and team eventually produced a custom Apple processor called the A4, which debuted in the iPad in 2010.
That seems to have worked out ‚Äî Apple has used its own custom chips in all iPhones and iPads since then, and they've gotten really good. The A11 chip in the latest iPhones may even be  faster at some tasks than desktop processors made by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). 
""Apple now finds itself making bets in terms of controlling core components in products,"" independent Apple analyst Neil Cybart  wrote in December, before Apple's display plans were revealed. 
It's not just chips and screens. Apple has also designed and owned its fingerprint sensor technology, Touch ID, created its own wireless chip, W1, and recently introduced its own graphics processor, jettisoning Imagination Technologies, which previously provided the technology for iPhone graphics. 
It also owns many of the key software and hardware components that are needed to build the True Depth camera used on the iPhone X to securely lock and unlock the device. In 2014, it announced its own programming language, Swift, that can be used to build apps and software for Apple computers. 
Apple is also likely to build its own wireless modem chip that will enable its devices to connect to high-speed cellular networks. It's currently in a bitter legal battle with Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), its previous modem supplier, which many industry observers believe is a prelude to introducing its own modem. 
""Apple is moving to the point at which it will have near complete control over every major component powering its device. Whether it is seen in new kinds of displays, smarter cameras, or custom silicon, hardware has a role to play in pushing more intelligent software and services,"" Cybart continued. "

So say  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists who warn higher volatility will sap equity gains while bonds lose their hedging potency.
‚ÄúThis moderation in risk-adjusted returns has begun to play out quickly, in particular due to the low-vol regime fading and equity/bond return correlationsbecoming positive,‚Äù Goldman strategists led by Ian Wright wrote in a note Friday.
From rising rates to slowing growth, risks are multiplying. That leaves those who rely on a traditional stock-bond portfolio split in developed markets most exposed as asset classes that had once once balanced each other out now fall together.
One proxy for the industry‚Äôs prospects, the DFA Global Allocation 60/40 portfolio, illustrates the shift. Last year, benign stock-bond correlations and an unstoppable bull market pushed 30-day volatility to a record low of 2.5 percent. Now, realized price swings stand at an elevated 11.6 percent -- compared with a 9 percent post-crisis average -- crimping returns adjusted for risk.
Goldman recommends equities over credit ‚Äúgiven the growth impulse has already led to a large tightening in credit spreads.‚Äù But even stocks should be taken with caution because earnings may succumb to growth disappointments.
‚ÄúJust as we would recommend staying invested in risk and ‚Äòbuying dips‚Äô in equity while growth remains strong, we would recommend buying smaller correction hedges at times when vol resets lower, in case rate or especially growth concerns rise,‚Äù Goldman strategists wrote.
Regardless of the market direction, volatility-adjusted returns in 2018 now look modest relative to expectations earlier in the year.
Goldman‚Äôs warning resonates with a growing consensus on Wall Street that sees clouds over the growth outlook.
The U.S. economy is in the ‚Äútwilight of the mid cycle‚Äù and investors should brace for the possibility it‚Äôs edging toward a recession, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). warned last week, even as its strategists remained largely bullish on risk.
 HSBC Holdings  (LON:HSBA) Inc. also sounded a note of caution. ‚ÄúMarkets have entered a transition phase which reduces risk-adjusted returns, but are not in a new regime yet,"" strategists led by Pierre Blanchet wrote earlier this month.

431,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 05:31PM ET</span>","Facebook under pressure as U.S., EU urge probes of data practices","By Dustin Volz and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg faced calls on Monday from U.S. and European lawmakers to explain how a consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's election campaign gained improper access to data on 50 million Facebook users.
Facebook's shares closed down nearly 7 percent, wiping nearly $40 billion off its market value as investors worried that new legislation could damage the company's advertising business.
""The lid is being opened on the black box of Facebook's data practices, and the picture is not pretty,"" said Frank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor who has written about Silicon Valley's use of data.
Lawmakers in the United States, Britain and Europe have called for investigations into media reports that political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the private data on more than 50 million Facebook users to develop techniques to support Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign. (http://reut.rs/2pn8btD)
The scrutiny presents a fresh threat to Facebook's reputation, which is already under attack over Russia's alleged use of Facebook tools to sway U.S. voters with divisive and false news posts before and after the 2016 election.
Facebook said on Monday it had hired digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg to carry out a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica, which had agreed to comply and give the forensics firm complete access to their servers and systems.
Cambridge Analytica said it strongly denies the media claims, and that it deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.
But further allegations about the firm's tactics piled up on Monday, as Channel 4 News, a British broadcaster, published video of Cambridge Analytica executives talking about using bribes, former spies and Ukrainian sex workers to entrap politicians.
Facebook was already facing calls on Saturday for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after reports in the New York Times and London's Observer over the weekend.
On Monday, Republican Senator John Kennedy called on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.
Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.
Facebook and rivals including  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's YouTube have taken voluntary steps to restrict possible foreign interference and combat false news, but they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes and legislation on the issue has stalled.
It was not clear whether Republicans who hold congressional committee gavels would announce hearings related to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. But the lawmaker comments reflected mounting bipartisan concern in Washington over whether internet firms are fair trustees of the massive amounts of user data they collect.
Some technology lobbyists have begun to quietly acknowledge the era of a hands-off approach to Silicon Valley from U.S. policymakers may be fading.
On Monday, the Senate was expected to move forward with a bill that would chip away at the internet industry‚Äôs legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking. The measure has already passed the House and is expected to soon become law. 
Facebook said on Friday it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing app he had built. 
Facebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved. It also said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission. 
Facebook shares fell 6.8 percent to $172.56, dragging the S&P 500 technology sector down 2.1 percent and broadly weighing on U.S. equities.
Fears of increased regulation also weighed on shares of Twitter, Google parent Alphabet and Snapchat parent  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP).
""(Tech companies) are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it,"" said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago. 
'VERY CONCERNING'
European officials, who have been more willing to regulate Silicon Valley companies than their U.S. counterparts, were especially strident in criticism of Facebook.
The revelations about Cambridge Analytica were ""horrifying, if confirmed,"" said EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova. ""We don't want this in the EU and will take all possible legal measures"" including stricter rules under the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation that takes effect in May, she said.
A spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the allegations were ""clearly very concerning."" 
Britain's Information Commissioner's Office said it would consider the potential new evidence as part of its separate civil and criminal probe into whether Facebook user data had been abused in British elections.

The head of the European Parliament said EU lawmakers will investigate possible data misuse, calling the allegations an unacceptable violation of citizens' privacy rights.

(Reuters) - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Inc's shares fell more than 4 percent in premarket trading after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's campaign gained inappropriate access to data on 50 million Facebook users.
The move would knock $23.8 billion off the social network's market value of $538 billion as of Friday's close and shares in other social media companies including  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) also dipped in early deals in New York.
One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised 'systemic problems' with Facebook's business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform.
The head of European Parliament said on Monday that EU lawmakers will investigate whether the data misuse has taken place, adding the allegation is an unacceptable violation of citizens' privacy rights.
Facebook was already facing new calls for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after the reports from the New York Times and London's Observer over the weekend.
The papers reported on Saturday that private information from more than 50 million Facebook users improperly ended up in the hands of data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, and that the information had not been deleted despite Facebook demands dating back to 2015.
""We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,"" said Brian Wieser, analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group, which already has a ""sell"" rating on a stock that rose 60 percent last year.
Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before.
He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company's business for now, with advertisers unlikely to ""suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform"".
""This episode appears likely to create another and potentially more serious public relations 'black eye' for the company and could lead to additional regulatory scrutiny,"" said Peter Stabler, analyst at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).
The losses would be Facebook's biggest daily fall since a broader market pullback in February. In January, when Facebook announced changes to its newsfeed which it said would hit user engagement in the near term, shares fell 4.5 percent in one day.
""It's clear with more 'heat in the kitchen from the Beltway' that further modest changes to their business model around advertising and news feeds/content could be in store over the next 12 to 18 months,"" said Daniel Ives, research analyst at GBH Insights.
He also argued that the issue was ""background noise"" on which Facebook could calm any regulatory nerves through further investments in security, ad content AI, improved content algorithms and screening mechanisms.
No analysts had so far changed their price targets or recommendations on Facebook in response to the reports. Wall Street is largely bullish on the stock with 40 of 44 analysts recommending the stock ""buy"" or higher.

FRANKFURT/BERLIN (Reuters) - Henkel's (DE:HNKG_p) laundry and beauty care sales will be hit by delivery failings in North America after problems with its logistics systems were exacerbated by U.S. trucking shortages.
Shares in the German consumer goods maker of Persil detergent and Loctite adhesives have underperformed the German blue-chip index <.GDAX> over the past year and were down 3.2 percent on the day at 1142 GMT.
Henkel has hit problems as it tried to improve its logistics system in North America, with workflow issues only emerging when it was operating at full capacity, a spokesman said.
Shortfalls in U.S. freight capacities made the situation worse, resulting in disruptions across Henkel's supply chain, including production planning, order processing, production, storage and transport to customers, he added.
In another case of a consumer company struggling to eke out efficiencies in its supply chain, KFC (N:YUM), had closed hundreds of its British fried food outlets last month due to a chicken shortage after it switched its delivery contract to DHL, a unit of  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn).
U.S. food companies have cited rising freight costs as a reason for lower profit margins, with more pain seen in 2018 as a dearth of drivers and higher diesel prices make it even more expensive to transport products to stores.
""You have your own system not working properly ... and then at the same time you have tightness in the market,"" said Liberum analyst Anubhav Malhotra. ""It was probably efficiency-boosting but it didn‚Äôt go according to plan.""
Part of the problem is drivers dumping long-haul jobs in favor of shorter trips for the likes of Deliveroo or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Malhotra said. 
After launching Persil in the United States in 2015, Henkel has been in a price war with Procter & Gamble (N:PG) and faces strong competition in its beauty business. It makes about a quarter of its sales in North America.
The logistics changes for the consumer goods businesses in North America is separate from Henkel's project to introduce a single global supply chain, that the spokesman said was progressing as planned.
Chief Executive Hans Van Bylen said the company expected to return to usual service levels during the second quarter.
The adhesives unit, which generates about half of the company's sales, and the professional haircare business were not affected and showed very good development, Henkel said.
Henkel expects a decline in organic sales for its laundry and beauty units in the first quarter, while overall organic sales growth should be ""slightly positive"".

It confirmed its 2018 outlook, with organic sales growth between 2 and 4 percent and adjusted earnings per share to rise between 5 and 8 percent. It is due to publish first-quarter results on May 9.

The Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act introduced during the rule of former president Robert Mugabe was designed to increase black Zimbabweans' stake in the sector but were open to abuse. 
Foreign investor confidence dipped as a result, prompting a promise by new President Emmerson Mnangagwa to change the rules.
Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa first announced the proposed changes to scale back the mine ownership in the 2018 budget statement in December.
The amendments were included in the Finance Act, which covers the 2018 budget and were signed into law by Mnangagwa on March 14, a government notice seen by Reuters on Monday showed.
Only state-owned mining entities will hold majority shares in diamond and platinum companies. However, existing businesses do not need to immediately comply with the law as they can negotiate a timeline of compliance with the authorities.
Foreign investors are allowed to have full control in any other mining venture, the notice said.
Mnangagwa has said at various forums that ""Zimbabwe is open for business"" as he seeks to revive an economy that was ruined under Mugabe's near four-decade rule.
Zimbabwe has the second largest known platinum deposits after South Africa and the two largest producers  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Platinum and Impala Platinum Holdings have operations in the country.

The amendments also open up 12 sectors previously reserved for locals such as bakeries, transport and beauty salons to Zimbabweans of all races instead of black Zimbabweans.

442,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 02:44PM ET</span>","U.S. retailers, shoe companies urge Trump not to hit China with tariffs","By Ginger Gibson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Retailers and shoemakers continued to sound alarms on Monday about their concerns that President Donald Trump's plan to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods from China will result in higher consumer prices. 
Several large U.S. retail companies, including Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT),  Best Buy  Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) and Macy's Inc, on Monday sent President Donald Trump a letter urging him not to impose massive tariffs on goods imported from China.
In a separate letter to Trump on Monday, 82 shoe companies, including  Nike  Inc (NYSE:NKE), Genesco, Payless ShoeSource Inc, Under Armour, Shoe Carnival (LON:CCL) Inc and Weyco Group echoed those concerns.
The Trump administration is said to be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology, telecommunications and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property and investment practices. Washington could impose more than $60 billion in tariffs on goods ranging from electronics to apparel, footwear and toys. 
""Applying any additional broad-based tariff ... would punish American working families with higher prices on household basics like clothing, shoes, electronics, and home goods,"" the retailers said.
The footwear companies argued that shoes already are subject to hefty tariffs. 
""Adding even more tariffs on top of this heavy burden would mean higher costs for footwear consumers and fewer U.S. jobs,"" the letter stated. ""Given the price sensitivity of our products, any additional increases in our costs would strike right at the heart of our ability to keep product competitively priced for our consumers."" 
A so-called Section 301 action would allow Trump to impose unilateral tariffs on China in response to a conclusion by the U.S. government that the Chinese had violated intellectual property rules. The tariffs would not need approval from Congress. 
The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the letter. 
The letter is the latest example of the growing division between the Trump administration and many in the business community over trade policy. On Sunday, a group of trade associations that represent most of the United States' large businesses sent a letter echoing concerns about the economic ramifications of tariffs.
Trade associations publicly pushing back include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the Information Technology Industry Council.
Sandy Kennedy, president of the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which organized Monday's letter, argued that tariffs would eliminate any benefit the recent tax overhaul provided the economy. 
""This is not American industries crying wolf,"" she said in a statement. 
The letter was signed by 24 companies, which also included Abercrombie & Fitch Co,  American Eagle Outfitters  (NYSE:AEO) Inc, Big Lots (NYSE:BIG) Inc, Chico‚Äôs FAS Inc, Columbia Sportswear Co, Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST),  Dollar Tree Inc  (NASDAQ:DLTR), Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), Havertys Furniture Cos Inc, J.C. Penney Co Inc, Jo-Ann Stores Llc, Kohl's Corp, Ikea North America Services Llc, Levi Strauss & Co, Qurate Retail Group, Sears Holdings Corp, The Michaels Companies Inc, VF Corp (NYSE:VFC), and Wolverine World Wide Inc. 
The letter asked the administration to work with companies to find a solution. 

""As you continue to investigate harmful technology and intellectual property practices, we ask that any remedy carefully consider the impact on consumer prices,"" the letter stated.

443,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 08:30AM ET</span>",Asian bond investors return to European shores as U.S. loses luster,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - Asian investors are returning to the European government bond market in numbers not seen in years, as a strengthening economy, positive yields and the increasing cost of dollar investments conspire to make Europe an attractive destination again.
Data shows Asian buyers making up a larger proportion of investors in recent government and government-linked bond sales than they have for years, having largely shunned a market that was offering record low yields.
For instance, a good chunk of recent bond sales by Belgium, Sweden and European government-backed borrowers such as the European Investment Bank and Germany's KfW was sold to Asia.
In Belgium's recent 4.5 billion euro sale of 15-year bonds, 12 percent -- or 540 million euros -- was bought by Asian investors and earlier in the year Asians accounted for 16.3 percent of the demand for the country's 10-year bond sale, allowing it to sell a record 5 billion euros of debt.
That's a far cry from last year when Belgium sold 1 percent or less of bond issues to Asian buyers.
While many assumed that Asian investors would return to the euro zone market as worries over the break-up of the bloc recede, both the data and comments from traders suggest buyers are returning in larger numbers than expected.
""Some of the (Asian) investors we are speaking to now are those we haven't spoken to in years,"" said one senior London-based banker who manages bond sales for several European governments.
""They are now coming back now that Europe is on a positive trajectory and the yields are no longer so low but also you have to be worried about U.S. Treasuries, given the huge amount of borrowing being undertaken by the Trump administration and all this talk around trade wars,"" he said.
He wanted to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to speak about his clients.
Another banker who works in a similar capacity for a rival institution said that typical investors in this space include the central banks of larger Asian countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Philippines, large banks from across the continent and asset managers from countries such as Japan.
Of all these countries, Japanese investor data is the most readily available.
Figures from the Japanese finance ministry showed net purchases of euro-denominated bonds by Japanese investors hit the second-highest level on record, confirming money managers were accelerating their shift to Europe and away from U.S. debt..
EUROPEAN ATTRACTION
The Asian buying surge could not come at a better time for Europe. It should help cap borrowing costs just as the European Central Bank prepares to withdraw support for the bond market.
This will give euro zone countries some breathing space as they tackle unprecedented levels of public debt incurred through the series of recent debt crises.
One factor driving the flows back to Europe is that the cost of hedging euro exposure is currently lower than hedging dollar risk - crucial for bond investors, who need to guard against currency swings.
""The attraction of hedged dollar bonds has diminished significantly,"" said Hiroshi Ozeki, chief investment officer at Nippon Life, one of Japan's largest institutional investors.
""We probably will no longer buy U.S. Treasuries with currency hedging. On the other hand, euro-denominated bonds are attractive in terms of hedging as we can earn premium instead of costs.""
A gauge measuring three month yen/dollar forward rates <JPY3M=>, a derivative often used for hedging currency exposure, is close to its highest since the 2008 financial crisis barring a brief spike at the end of last year. The yen/euro equivalent <EURJPY3M=> is far steadier.
""In recent months given how US rates have been going up the hedging costs there have gone up too. We have a couple of Japanese clients who are talking of moving money from the US to Europe and the main reason given is the hedging cost,"" Roberto Coronado, Senior Portfolio Manager, Investment Grade Credit, PineBridge Investments
Peter Chatwell, head of rates at Mizuho International, the investment banking arm of Japan's second largest bank, pointed to the underperformance of U.S. government bonds compared to European, as a symptom of this.
The gap between short-dated German and U.S. bond yields -- which move inversely to price -- is at their widest in over 20 years.
France and Germany have not conducted any recent bond syndications where a geographical breakdown of the investor base was revealed.
But German state-guaranteed development KfW, often seen as a proxy for sovereign debt, this week sold 18 percent of a 4 billion euro sale of five-year bonds to Asian investors and EU-backed European Investment Bank sold 11 percent of a 5 billion euros 10-year deal to Asian investors.

WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - Barring a last-minute buyer, Toys 'R' Us will soon disappear from U.S. shopping centers, but the name and its iconic Geoffrey the Giraffe mascot are likely to survive for another generation of Toys 'R' Us kids.
Buyers often swoop in on retailers that are going out of business and scoop up brands with an eye on maintaining ties with loyal customers, minus the bricks and mortar.
""Toys 'R' Us -- that's a fabulous name,"" said Cathy Hershcopf, an attorney who specializes in retail bankruptcies. ""The jingle, the customer lists, the logo ... and the giraffe goes along with it."" 
Brand specialists said they could not put an estimated value on the name, but it will be among the most valuable ever to become available through a bankruptcy liquidation.
The name adorns stores in 38 countries, from Australia to Zambia. 
Retailers going out of business often sell their names and logos to the highest bidder, which generates some cash to help repay creditors. Examples include The Sharper Image, which filed for bankruptcy in 2008, and Coldwater Creek, which went bust in 2014.
The Sharper Image stores were known for featuring sleek gadgets like $5,000 massage chairs. Investors led by Hilco Consumer Capital swooped in and bought the company for $49 million and refashioned it as a licensor of lifestyle goods. Its website currently features drones, a toaster for bacon and motorized tie rack, all for less than $60.
Hilco specializes in buying well-known brands from dying companies, including home furnishings company Bombay, lingerie chain Frederick's of Hollywood and Linens-N-Things, as well as former tech titans Polaroid and Atari, according to its website. 
Generally, interested buyers want to add a new brand to existing internet retail operations, although bankruptcy specialists said bidders on the Toys 'R' Us brand might acquire a small number of stores to operate as showrooms.
Alexander Chernev, a professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management, said brand buyers who succeed are those with strong operations like logistics but who lack emotional connections with their customers.
""They seek access not just to the market ... but also to the minds of the consumer.""
He said Toys 'R' Us could make a good fit with a Chinese manufacturer that seeks credibility with consumers.
That's what happened with Robb & Stucky, a Florida-based furniture chain that liquidated in 2011. A Chinese manufacturer bought the name and trademarks and relaunched the store operations, according to Jordi Guso, a bankruptcy attorney with Berger Singerman.
Other failed brand names attract buyers who are more interested in defense than offense. Dick's Sporting Goods acquired The Sports Authority name through bankruptcy in 2016 for around $16 million, in part because an overseas rival was also interested, according to Hershcopf. The Sports Authority name was essentially removed from the market.
She dismissed concerns that the Toys 'R' Us brand was damaged by the chain's failure.

""I don‚Äôt think the brand is tarnished. I think the shopping in the old stores is tarnished.""

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid about 1 percent on Monday, with volatility spiking, as Facebook's shares sank after reports that its user data was misused led to concerns over broader privacy violations and sparked a selloff in technology stocks.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shares 6 percent and were on track for their worst day in more than three years on reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's campaign gained inappropriate access to data on more than 50 million users.
That sparked concerns over the collection and use of data, especially related to individuals, at other tech companies and sent the Nasdaq Composite sliding 1.5 percent and the S&P technology index down 1.8 percent in their worst day since a sell-off in early February.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he believed some internet companies have grown too fast to digest their responsibilities and obligations.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) ‚Äì all part of the so-called FAANG group, along with Facebook ‚Äì were down between 1 percent and 6.3 percent.
""Tech companies all use data one way or the other as part of their businesses. They are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it,"" said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.
""That's dragging a lot of those FAANG stocks down because at the end of the day, really what a lot of those companies did is they were taking a lot of data and using algorithms to dial in their product,"" Cruz said.
At 11:00 a.m. ET, the Nasdaq declined 1.58 percent to 7,363.71 and the S&P 500 fell 1.05 percent to 2,723.09.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.01 percent at 24,694.52, weighed down by industrial stocks.
Industrials fell 0.83 percent ahead of the Group of 20 finance ministers' meeting, where Trump's tariffs plans are likely to dominate discussions.
All the 11 major S&P sectors were lower. The CBOE Volatility index was up about 3 points at 18.68, in one of its sharpest gains since early February.
""You see money flow a lot out of these industries across the board, you've come out of bonds a little bit too and a pop in VIX, that points to a little bit more of risk being priced in,"" said Cruz.
The Federal Reserve's policy meeting, over Tuesday and Wednesday, is also in focus as investors brace for a near-certain interest rate hike this week.
But the focus is on whether policymakers think economic conditions are strong enough for four hikes this year, one more than the markets expect.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE for a 4.39-to-1 ratio, and on a 3.41-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

Shareholder groups ShareSoc and the UK Shareholders' Association (UKSA) said on Monday the bank had agreed to let investors consider the creation of an advisory committee including shareholder representatives that would have a say on high-profile and controversial issues like executive pay. 
The vote will take place at the bank's annual general meeting (AGM) in May via a special resolution, meaning it will need 75 percent of votes cast to succeed rather than the standard 50 percent. 
ShareSoc director and co-ordinator of its RBS campaign, Cliff Weight, said ShareSoc and UKSA had been calling for better shareholder engagement for over 20 years. 
""At last our efforts are being recognized,"" he said. ""A positive vote at the AGM will be a great step forward for shareholder democracy.""
As majority shareholder with a 71 percent stake, the British government's position will be decisive in the vote. Prime Minister Theresa May said she would crack down on irresponsible capitalism when appointed in 2016. 
ShareSoc and UKSA had previously said they would launch a campaign to persuade UK Financial Investments (UKFI), which manages the government's shareholdings, and institutional shareholders to vote for the proposal. 
UKFI declined to comment. 
The two groups have been fighting to force a vote on the proposal since 2016, arguing the creation of a committee would improve corporate governance and avoid the mistakes that led to the bank's 45.5 billion pound ($63.8 billion) state bailout in 2008. RBS had previously rejected a vote on the proposals on legal grounds. 
""RBS has been very clear in its support for enhanced corporate governance and, in particular, stakeholder engagement,"" an RBS spokeswoman said. 
""We have liaised closely with ShareSoc and UKSA to ensure their resolution was in a fit state to be put to shareholders at this year's AGM.""

(Reuters) - Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec (CDPQ), one of Canada's biggest public pension funds, has relied on private equity firms to invest in leveraged corporate buyouts. Now it is building its own investing team to depend less on buyout firms as middle men.
Private equity firms buy companies only to sell them a few years down the line for a profit. Their reputation as costcutters eyeing a speedier exit makes some companies more open to consider an investment from a longer-term investor such as CDPQ instead.
""These are interesting (opportunities) because typically these entrepreneurs or corporates didn't want to partner with standard private equity firms,"" Stephane Etroy, CDPQ's head of private equity, said in an interview. 
In recent years, large pension and sovereign wealth funds have teamed up with private equity firms to co-invest in corporate takeovers, in a bid to earn a greater share of profits and reduce their fees. However, private equity firms offer these co-investment opportunities only to their fund investors, known as limited partners. 
Investing without the involvement of a private equity firm is still rare, making up only 62 of more than 300 direct deals carried out in 2017 by investors who were not private equity firms, according to the Boston Consulting Group. The majority of these direct deals were co-investments. 
CDPQ, which manages almost C$300 billion ($229.2 billion) for retirees in Quebec, now makes two-thirds of private equity investments without the use of external managers. 
To be sure, investor demand to get into private equity funds is still outstripping supply, resulting in record fundraising for the industry in 2017. 
The resources required for such deals, ranging from sourcing opportunities to industry expertise, mean the option is open only to larger players like blue-chip pension funds and sovereign wealth funds. 
""When you think about going direct without sponsors, for us it's probably more the exception than the rule,"" said Simon Marc, head of private equity at PSP Investments, another Canadian pension fund. 
""We will do that in situations, typically with entrepreneurs or families, where people are looking for long-term capital and they want to stay away from traditional private equity-type capital,"" he added.
CDPQ has much bigger plans for solo investing. The fund is looking to boost its headcount in Singapore - one of its three private equity offices along with London and New York - to more than ten in order to ""have critical mass"" for direct investing.
""We are looking to hire professionals coming from private equity firms,"" Etroy said.

(Reuters) - Newell Brands Inc (N:NWL) said on Monday it has agreed to appoint four directors to its board put forward by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a deal that excludes activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, which had mounted its own board challenge.
The agreement is an example of activist investors competing against each other rather than working in tandem. Starboard, which is seeking to replace Newell's entire board of directors, declined to comment on its next move. 
Icahn disclosed a 6.86 percent stake in the Hoboken, New Jersey-based consumer products company last Friday. However, he and Newell CEO Michael Polk have been in discussions since last month, according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to disclose the confidential talks.
One analyst said the Icahn board deal changes the dynamics of the contest. ""But it doesn't mean that Starboard will capitulate,"" said Damien Park, managing director at consulting group Spotlight Advisors.
Newell's shares were down 6.5 percent $26.79 on Monday afternoon, giving the company a market capitalization of $13 billion.
""There is likely also a belief that the activist who loses will sell shares, putting pressure on the stock,"" Renaissance Macro Research analyst April Scee said. 
Newell said it had accepted Icahn's designated nominees Patrick Campbell, Brett Icahn, Andrew Langham and Courtney Mather to sit on its board alongside existing directors Polk, James Craigie, Debra Crew, Steven Strobel and Michael Todman. 
In addition, Judith Sprieser and another independent director nominee designated by Icahn and approved by Newell's board will be nominated to stand for election at the company's 2018 annual shareholder meeting.
Starboard has put forward a 12-member slate to replace Newell‚Äôs board, arguing the maker of Rubbermaid, Crock-Pot slow cookers and Yankee Candles has underperformed peers and mismanaged its $15.4 billion acquisition of Jarden Corp in 2016.
Starboard had teamed up with former Jarden executives and board members including former chairman Martin Franklin, who resigned from Newell's board earlier this year. 
Icahn said in a statement that his views on strategy are aligned with those of the company, including on its ""expanded transformation plan"" that includes divesting some business lines. 
Late last month, Newell outlined ongoing plans to overhaul itself from a hybrid holding-and-operating company to a more focused operator, with an increased emphasis on higher-margin operations such as online sales.

Icahn had said in a regulatory filing last week that he had spoken to Starboard but that he had not yet decided which side he will back.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","European shares sink, Micro Focus plummets","By Helen Reid
LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday as investors remained cautious ahead of an expected Fed rate hike, while earnings and M&A took center stage with software company  Micro Focus  sinking and a bid for  Hammerson  boosting commercial real estate stocks. 
Micro Focus (L:MCRO) dropped 55 percent to a three-year low after it cut its annual revenue forecast and its CEO quit. Revenue was hit by lower license income and issues with its purchase of Hewlett Packard Enterprise assets.
The firm's shedding of more than half its market value caused Europe's tech sector index (SX8P) to tumble 2.4 percent, its worst fall since early February when global markets sank.
A scuppered cross-border commercial real estate deal also made waves on Monday, with Hammerson (L:HMSO) soaring 27 percent to the top of the STOXX 600 after saying it had rebuffed a takeover offer from France's  Klepierre  (PA:LOIM).
The offer, which strategists said would have helped Klepierre gain a foothold in the UK market, valued Hammerson's shares at a 40.7 percent premium to Friday's closing price.
Before today's surge Hammerson's shares were down 19.8 percent year-to-date, making them attractive to potential suitors. The rejection sent Klepierre shares down 3.5 percent.
""Klepierre owns and operates 100 shopping centres in 16 countries across Europe and the quality has been improved over the past 5 years, with the UK the missing part of the jigsaw (the same could be said of Unibail),"" said Liberum strategists, referring to Klepierre competitor Unibail Rodamco (AS:UNBP).
Europe's main benchmark, the STOXX 600 (STOXX) index, fell 0.7 percent as investors held their breath ahead of Wednesday's U.S. Federal Reserve meeting which marks the debut for new Fed Chair Jerome Powell, and a likely interest rate hike. 
Eyes were also on a news conference on Brexit negotiations, hastily scheduled by the European Commission for 1145 GMT, as speculation swirled over a potential interim deal ahead of the EU Summit later in the week.
Disappointing results weighed on German consumer goods firm Henkel (DE:HNKG_p), which fell 5.1 percent after it said the first quarter was off to a slow start due to delivery difficulties in North America. 
While Hammerson's surge higher drove the European real estate sector index (SX86P) up 0.8 percent to the top spot, tech stocks were the worst performers.
Even before Micro Focus' dramatic drop, European investors' sentiment had been turning more cautious on the tech sector which has led stellar gains across global markets.
Unicredit (MI:CRDI) analysts on Monday said they had downgraded the tech sector to 'neutral' and upgraded utilities to overweight, arguing investors should increase their share of defensive sectors with economic indicators at elevated levels.
German food processing machinery maker GEA Group (DE:G1AG) gained 4 percent after the firm said its CEO Juerg Oleas was to step down in April 2019 after more than a decade in office.

Sweden's Dometic (ST:DOMETIC) fell 3.5 percent after the recreational vehicle products firm was downgraded to ""underweight"" by  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), whose strategists said the U.S. RV market is overheating.

465,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 05:00AM ET</span>",Apple developing own screens using next-generation MicroLED tech: Bloomberg,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is developing its own MicroLED device displays and has made small numbers of the screens for testing, Bloomberg reported, in a move that could hurt Asian display suppliers to the U.S. tech giant over the long-term.
MicroLED is a new display technology that has grabbed the attention of several tech firms. Screens using MicroLED are thinner, brighter, use less power and are more durable than the OLED displays that are increasingly being adopted for a variety of smart devices.
The new technology is however unproven and difficult to use, analysts say.
""It is not clear whether MicroLED will be better than the OLED displays Apple uses for its smartwatches. At this point, this seems to me that Apple wants to show off - its more of what look what we can do rather than a realistic alternative,"" said Dongbu Securities analyst S.R. Kwon.
Apple is developing MicroLED screens at a secret plant in California in a project overseen by Lynn Youngs, who is in charge of iPhone and Apple Watch screen technology, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.
The company aims to use the new technology in its wearable computers first, the report said, adding that it is unlikely to reach an iPhone for at least three to five years.
Apple declined to comment.
Shares in Asian display makers initially slid on the news on Monday but later pared losses. Shares in Sharp Corp, Japan Display Inc and LG Display Co Ltd ended the day between 1.6 percent and 2.4 percent lower.
Other tech giants looking at the technology include Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, Apple's main contract manufacturer. It acquired U.S. MicroLED display startup eLux Inc last year through Sharp Corp and other group units.
Sony Corp (T:6758) started selling large display systems using the technology for corporate users last year, and Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co unveiled a MicroLED TV this January.

467,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 06:33AM ET</span>",Alibaba doubles Lazada investment to $4 billion in aggressive Southeast Asian expansion,"By Cate Cadell and Aradhana Aravindan
BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) -  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) said it will invest an extra $2 billion in Southeast Asian e-commerce firm Lazada Group and tapped a top executive to run the business, as it takes on rivals such as tech titan Amazon in an aggressive expansion in the region. 
One of the 18 founders of Alibaba, veteran executive Lucy Peng will take over as Lazada's chief executive, replacing founder Max Bittner who will become a senior adviser to Alibaba. 
Alibaba's stake will increase to an undisclosed size following the latest investment, a spokeswoman told Reuters. It held an 83 percent stake prior to the investment, which now doubles to $4 billion from a $2 billion infusion over the past two years. 
""The investment underscores Alibaba's confidence in the future success of Lazada's business and the growth prospect of the Southeast Asian market, a region that is a key part of Alibaba's global growth strategy,"" Alibaba said in a statement.
Backed by large cash piles and soaring stock prices, Alibaba's new funding in loss-making Lazada underlines an ambitious global push to secure a bigger share of the fast-growing multi-billion dollar e-commerce market. 
It follows a year of brisk expansion in Southeast Asia by the Chinese e-commerce giant and its payment affiliate Ant Financial, as it faces off against the world's biggest online retailer Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and fellow Chinese retailer JD.com Inc (O:JD) to tap new consumers in the region. 
""With a young population, high mobile penetration and just three percent of the region‚Äôs retail sales currently conducted online, we feel very confident to double down on Southeast Asia,"" said Peng, who is also the executive chair at Ant Financial.
ONLINE BATTLEGROUND
Alibaba operates in more than 200 countries and has more than 500 million people using its shopping apps every month, allowing Lazada to tap more of the e-commerce giant's resources. 
Rival firms are already plowing billions of dollars building extensive logistics infrastructure in the region. 
Last year Amazon launched its two-hour delivery in Singapore, while China's JD.com has built its own logistics network in Indonesia, and in January announced an investment in Vietnamese online retailer Tiki.vn.
""It's a sign of how seriously Alibaba perceive the growth opportunity, and competitive threats, in Southeast Asia,"" said James Lloyd, Asia-Pacific fintech leader at EY.
Indeed, with 640 million consumers, a growing middle class and deepening smartphone penetration, Southeast Asia is shaping up as a major battleground for technology giants. Consultancy Frost & Sullivan forecast total gross merchandise value of e-commerce in the region to rise to $65.5 billion in 2021 from $20.5 billion last year.
""If India was the first key battleground between U.S. and Chinese vertical-leaders, then Southeast Asia is surely the second,"" said Lloyd.
Alibaba, which has posted double-digit revenue growth every year since 2013, has started offering curated selections of goods from its own Taobao platform to Lazada users. Last April Ant Financial acquired Lazada payment affiliate helloPay Group, re-branding it under its own Alipay brand.
In addition, its cloud business has invested heavily in building data center infrastructure in the region, facilitating the spread of its digital commerce and payments services.
Ant Financial, where Peng was previously chief executive, has also purchased stakes in a handful of other Southeast Asian Payment ventures.
Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings (TEM.UL) and Lazada management are the only other stakeholders in Lazada. 

Launched in 2012, Lazada operates in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 05:54AM ET</span>",Singapore fines Standard Chartered entities $4.9 million for money laundering breaches,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank imposed penalties of S$5.2 million ($3.95 million) on  Standard Chartered  Bank (SCBC) (L:STAN) and S$1.2 million on Standard Chartered Trust (Singapore) (SCTS) for breaching money laundering rules and terrorism financing safeguards.
In a statement on Monday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said the breaches occurred when trust accounts of SCBS' customers were transferred from Standard Chartered Trust (Guernsey) to SCTS from December 2015 to January 2016.
""MAS requires financial institutions to adequately assess money laundering risks when deciding whether to accept customers. They should also have in place good systems and processes to monitor customer transactions,"" said MAS Deputy Managing Director Ong Chong Tee.
The MAS and Guernsey's Financial Services Commission had been looking into Standard Chartered's movement of some assets, mainly of Indonesian clients in late 2015, just before the Channel Island adopted new global rules on exchanging tax information.
""The timing of the transfers raised questions of whether the clients were attempting to avoid their CRS reporting obligations. However, SCBS and SCTS did not adequately assess and mitigate against this risk factor, and also failed to file suspicious transaction reports in a timely manner,"" MAS said.
In a statement, Standard Chartered conceded that it fell short of its own standards to mitigate risks but said it was taking action to rectify these deficiencies.
""We ourselves identified the issue, we recognized that we weren't as diligent as we needed to be in the transfer of some trust assets from Guernsey to Singapore,"" Standard Chartered's CEO Bill Winters said at Credit Suisse's annual Asia Investment Conference in Hong Kong on Monday. ""We reported both our own shortcomings and also the action of our clients to the MAS,"" 
""The important thing...is we are making investments necessary to make sure there is no repeat,"" he said.

Standard Chartered said in 2016 that it was to close its trust operations in Guernsey and centralize that part of its business in Singapore.

469,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 04:04AM ET</span>","Bear Market for Bonds Seen by Gross, Dalio So Near, Yet So Far","(Bloomberg) -- Bill Gross, Ray Dalio and Paul Tudor Jones may have to wait for their bear market.
The sell-off in U.S. Treasuries has stalled this month after yields looked set to pass 3 percent for the first time in over four years, while German bunds have rallied to reverse half the year‚Äôs rise in yields. That‚Äôs partly because of sluggish inflation and increased concerns over a trade war. Three Federal Reserve interest-rate increases are already priced in, while the European Central Bank is not giving any clues on the timing of its hikes.
‚ÄúConflicting forces -- supply, inflation and the ECB‚Äôs asset-purchase program -- should keep ranges intact for some time‚Äù for bund yields, said Charles Diebel, a money manager at  Aviva  (LON:AV) Investors, which oversees 353 billion pounds ($491 billion) in assets. ‚ÄúGlobal yields will unlikely break out until the third quarter at the earliest.‚Äù
Yields on both sides of the Atlantic climbed rapidly earlier this year, with the prospect of tightening monetary policy, stronger growth and signs of a pickup in inflation forcing investors to abandon long-held bullishness. Hedge fund veteran Tudor Jones this month joined fellow investment big-hitters Dalio and Gross in heralding a bear market in fixed income.
German 10-year yields have fallen 9 basis points this month to 0.57 percent, having touched a high of 0.81 percent in early February. Those on their U.S. counterparts have dipped in March to around 2.85 percent, after reaching 2.95 percent a month ago.
No Tantrum
‚ÄúGiven the still subdued inflation picture globally, a general lower risk appetite and a market that will most likely buy into the ECB ‚Äòno taper tantrum‚Äô story, we have postponed most of the expected rise in yields until 2019,‚Äù Danske Bank A/S strategists Arne Lohmann Rasmussen and Morten Ehlers wrote in a note to clients. ‚ÄúWe still see no ECB hike before 2Q 2019.‚Äù
Even a deluge of European supply did nothing to prevent the upswing in German bonds, while their peripheral peers in Spain and Italy have also remained resilient to political risk following the latter‚Äôs election on March 4. For  Commerzbank AG  (DE:CBKG), continued asset purchases from the ECB are denting the free float of tradeable government securities, supporting European debt.
‚ÄúWith scarcity spreading beyond bunds even at lower QE purchases, strategic EGB tighteners and swap spread wideners hold more upside,‚Äù wrote head of rates strategy Michael Leister, who estimates that ‚Äòsticky investors‚Äô such as central banks own over 60 percent of core bonds. ‚ÄúSupply-demand imbalances on sovereign bond markets are moving to center stage.‚Äù

477,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 02:18AM ET</span>",Relationship goals: Ford tries to rebuild trust with China partners,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - After 20-odd years of ""marriage"" in China, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co is having relationship issues.
The U.S. automaker, losing ground in the world's largest car market, is trying to maintain trust and respect in its partnerships with Changan Automobile Group and Jiangling Motors Group (JMC), putting pressure on sales efforts, according to four sources at Ford and its China joint ventures.
""Changan and Ford have already been married for (nearly two decades) but we still don‚Äôt trust each other,‚Äù one of the sources said.
In an effort to improve relations and reverse a recent sales slump, Ford is preparing for a new product blitz and a campaign to localize management in China, according to Peter Fleet, head of Ford's Asia-Pacific operations.
Ford sales fell 6 percent last year even as overall vehicle sales in China rose 3 percent. Sales during the first two months of this year are down 23 percent.
Fleet said the company was looking beyond the sales numbers to focus on ""structural priorities"".
""I think our partnerships are in good shape, and I want them to be even better,‚Äù Fleet said in an interview with Reuters.
It will likely take Ford until next year, when the first of the wave of new vehicles arrives¬†in showrooms, to start regaining momentum in China.
‚ÄúThis year will be a bit like going through a tunnel,‚Äù Fleet said. ‚ÄúWe have to get through 2018.‚Äù 
By 2025, however, Fleet says the U.S. automaker plans to boost China revenue by 50 percent from 2017 levels, largely by launching more than 50 new or redesigned products. Those new cars include 15 electric vehicles.
MORE LOCAL STAFF, COLLABORATION 
Over the past 12-18 months, tensions¬†in Ford‚Äôs China partnerships began impacting¬†the morale of the joint ventures‚Äô sales forces, made up mostly of local workers from its Chinese partners, according to three of the sources - a Changan official and two Ford China insiders. The sources declined to be named because they are not authorized to speak to reporters.
Morale sank especially after Ford tried to streamline its two separate brand identities and its dual distribution systems, those sources said.
""At Changan-Ford, Ford often tries to intrude far into our territory; they're interventionist and are most aggressive among global automakers at trying to have their say on how we run our day-to-day activities,"" the Changan official said. ""That makes our job sometimes difficult."" 
Low morale in the auto business often has a direct correlation with sales volume, as it affects the determination of an auto brand's sales team to sell more cars. 
A spokeswoman for the Changan-Ford joint venture, Jia Qun, said the relationship between Changan and Ford is in good shape. 
‚ÄúLast year, our two parent companies said we wanted to strengthen our partnership. I see more cooperation opportunities,‚Äù she said. 
Sources said the partner relationships did begin improving after steps by Ford late last year. 
Ford pledged to make a more full-fledged effort to develop technology and products in China jointly with its partners.
One possibility, according to one source:¬†JMC and Ford might soon develop electrified trucks and vans in China as Beijing pushes aggressively for battery vehicles.
Ford has so far collaborated little with Changan or JMC on product development, with only the Escort car and the seven-seater Edge crossover SUV to show in terms of China-specific models.
Ford also promised to hire and promote more Chinese nationals to replace expatriate employees, many of whom lack the cultural background and language skills to work effectively with their JV counterparts, according to three Ford sources. 
Ford told Changan and JMC it plans¬†to fill a majority of expat positions with local managers in the next four years, cutting the number of foreigners by 70 percent by 2021.¬†
""WORK IN PROGRESS""
Still, one of the Ford sources describe the China partnerships as a ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù - a task complicated by a sudden resignation in January of the company‚Äôs China chief, Jason Luo.
One of Luo's tasks when appointed in August was to strengthen external relations, including those with Ford's joint-venture partners. Ford said Luo's departure after just five months was for personal reasons and Luo has not commented.
A few years ago, things looked much better for the 115-year -old company.
Leveraging SUVs including the EcoSport, Ford sales rose nearly 60 percent in 2013 and 17 percent in 2014, enabling the company to zoom past Toyota and Honda in sales, according to consultancy LMC Automotive.
All that momentum, however, has been lost. U.S. rival General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) sold 4 million cars in China last year, compared to Ford‚Äôs 1.19 million, and Honda and Toyota now sell more than Ford again. 
The challenge of maintaining a stable relationship with a Chinese partner isn‚Äôt unique to Ford. 
Volkswagen AG‚Äôs (DE:VOWG_p) Audi tried to set up a second joint venture in China, angering existing partner FAW Group Corp [SASACJ.UL] and dealers, resulting in sales stalling. 
Having two partners has also complicated matters for Ford.
Two years ago, Ford began moves to combine the two different joint venture display stands it presents at major auto shows in China into one that more prominently displayed the Blue Oval sign.
Ford and its partners also initially disagreed on the merits of combining the two separate distribution and service entities of the joint ventures into a single national channel, according to two of the Ford sources.
Changan and JMC have since agreed to those proposals.¬†

The new Ford display stand debuted at the Shanghai auto show last year, while Ford and its partners are now gearing to launch a unified distribution and service company before the end of this year - signs perhaps of the ‚Äúnew phase of our partnerships‚Äù that Fleet envisages.

481,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 01:33AM ET</span>",How China's ride-hailing giant Didi plans to challenge Uber in Mexico,"By Julia Love and Heather Somerville
MEXICO CITY/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Working quietly from a shared office space in one of Mexico City's trendiest neighborhoods, China's ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing is planning to hit its archrival Uber where it hurts.
Mexico is one of Uber Technologies Inc's [UBER.UL] most prized and profitable markets. The San Francisco firm boasts a near monopoly here, with seven million users in more than three dozen cities. Which is precisely why Didi wants to knock Uber from that comfortable perch.
To learn how to conquer Uber, the Chinese firm is going straight to the source. It is poaching Uber employees for its Mexico management team. Didi employees are riding incognito with Uber drivers and chatting up passengers to pinpoint weaknesses, according to people familiar with its strategy. And Didi is thinking bigger than Uber, with ambitions for bike-sharing, scooters and motorcycles in Mexico, the people say.
The Chinese firm has deep pockets, thanks to blue-chip global investors that include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Japan's SoftBank Group Corp (9984.T). In the past year alone, it has pulled in nearly $10 billion to help fund global expansion.
""I would not want to go to war with Didi,"" said Beijing-based investor and adviser Jeffrey Towson. ""They don't lose.""
But whether Didi can beat its nemesis here is far from certain. Mexico is the Chinese firm's first attempt at building an operation from scratch outside of Asia - a costly gambit.
What is clear is that Didi is under pressure to keep growing to justify its $56 billion valuation. Latin America is the newest battleground for the old rivals, and Didi will be in enemy territory.
""It's fundamentally different when you're jumping across an ocean,"" said IHS Markit analyst Jeremy Carlson.
DIDI ASCENDING
Didi Chuxing Technology Co is the world's largest ride-hailing firm by number of rides, thanks to its commanding market share in China, where it has 450 million users. It completed more than 7.4 billion rides last year, not quite double Uber's count.
Uber learned the hard way about Didi's brawn. After waging an expensive campaign to crack the Chinese market, Uber in 2016 sold its operation to Didi in exchange for a 17.5 percent stake in the Chinese firm, which also made a $1 billion investment in Uber.
The titans continue to butt heads as they race to carve up the rest of the globe. Uber is the top dog in Latin America, where Brazil and Mexico rank among its largest markets outside the United States. In Mexico, Uber held an 87 percent market share as of August, according to Dalia Research, a Berlin-based consumer research firm.
(For a graphic on Uber's market share in Latin America, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2FhfZHo)
Didi wants to change that. Reuters was first to report that Didi had designs on Mexico, where it began recruiting employees last year.
The company declined to talk openly about its plans, but details of its strategy are emerging.
Nestled on the ninth floor of a WeWork shared office building in the capital's Juarez neighborhood, Didi is building an operation from the ground up. In foreign markets such as India and the Middle East, it purchased stakes in existing companies. But Uber is so dominant in Mexico that there is no clear investment opportunity in a local competitor, according to people familiar with Didi's thinking.
Hungry for experienced talent, Didi is aggressively recruiting current and former Uber employees, offering to nearly double their salaries in some cases, two people with knowledge of the matter said.
At the helm of Didi's Mexico operation is Uber veteran Lin Ma, who helped launch Uber's ill-fated venture in China. Now Didi's director of international operations, Ma also worked on operations at 99, the Brazilian ride-hailing startup that Didi purchased at the end of last year, according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Ma and others at Didi have so far poached at least five Uber managers and specialists in Mexico who have experience in operations, logistics, strategy, marketing and driver training, a review of LinkedIn profiles shows.
Ma declined to comment.
The company has yet to recruit drivers, and it is not clear which cities it will enter first, according to a person familiar with Didi's strategy.
Rather than compete solely on price, the person said, Didi plans to promote safe drivers and fast response times; the company has built an algorithm to help it predict 15 minutes in advance where it should dispatch vehicles.
Didi is also considering offering bike-sharing, scooters and motorcycles in Mexico, while Uber so far has stuck to ride-hailing. A broad array of transport options helped Didi prevail in China.
But the biggest difference may come down to cash. To protect drivers, the person said, Didi will not handle cash fares in Mexico.
Uber, meanwhile, has pushed Mexican lawmakers hard for the right to accept cash in a region where tens of millions lack bank accounts. The move has generated business, along with controversy.
In Brazil, Uber saw a surge of robberies and murders of its drivers after the company began accepting cash there, according to a 2017 Reuters analysis. Uber says it has added tools to authenticate riders' identities, better protecting drivers.
Mexico has not seen a similar wave of attacks so far. Nevertheless, Uber's position puts it at odds with regulators in some Mexican states.
While Didi appears to be sidestepping that obstacle, it faces cultural hurdles in Latin America, according to Daisy Wu, head of international business at Yeahmobi, which helps Chinese startups go global.
Latin American consumers generally prefer U.S. brands to Chinese brands, she said, and Chinese business culture can be off-putting to local employees.
""Most of the Chinese companies that have gone to Latin America are still trying to be successful,"" Wu said.
Didi, for example, bewildered Mexico job candidates by trying to schedule interviews the week of Christmas.
""I was very surprised ‚Ä¶ I was thinking, should I cancel my vacation?"" one applicant told Reuters.
UBER'S BATTLE
Uber's lead in Latin America, meanwhile, has taken on heightened importance as it prepares for a potential initial public offering next year.
The company, which lost $4.5 billion last year, is facing fierce competition at home and in Asia, and a regulatory crackdown in Europe. It is also recovering from a year of scandals that saw co-founder Travis Kalanick forced out as chief executive in June amid multiple federal criminal probes and a workplace marred by sexual harassment allegations.
Andrew Macdonald, Uber's vice president of operations for Latin America and Asia Pacific, said Uber is prepared to do what it takes to remain dominant in Mexico, a profitable market amid a sea of losses.
""Whether that's more spending on customer acquisition or more deeply engaging with our existing customers, that will continue to be our focus,"" he said.
Uber is committed to maintaining cheap fares for its basic service to keep its Mexican customers loyal, Macdonald said. But he said the company is considering adding more ride options such as upscale cars that would boost revenue.
If Uber is nervous about Didi stealing its lead in Mexico, it is not showing it. Macdonald said the learning curve is steep, something its rival is about to find out.

""Didi has significant bankroll,"" Macdonald said. ""But there are significant local complexities.""

482,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 07:27AM ET</span>",Amazon tracks repeat shoppers for line-free Seattle store - and there are many,"By Jeffrey Dastin
LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) is tracking how regularly customers shop at its store without checkout lines in Seattle - and so far, the verdict is they keep coming back.
""The ones who work very close, like in the building up above, will come down even just to grab a drink because it's so fast and easy,"" Amazon Vice President Gianna Puerini said in an interview at the ShopTalk e-commerce conference in Las Vegas.
The detail offers an early glimpse at how the store, known as Amazon Go, is faring two months after opening its doors to the public. Shopping frequency, sales and other metrics reviewed by Amazon will likely inform how it thinks about expanding the concept elsewhere in the United States, if at all.
Amazon Go is fashioned after small grocery stores, with a crucial difference: it has no cashiers. Customers scan a smartphone app to enter the store, and then cameras and sensors track what they remove from the shelves and what they put back.
Amazon then bills shoppers' credit cards on file after they leave.
Puerini said store associates spend the vast majority of their time restocking shelves - another indication of the shop's popularity.
Research-focused venture capital firm Loup Ventures wrote of Amazon Go last month: ""Our experience was flawless, leaving us increasingly confident that Amazon is best positioned to own the operating system of automated retail. Eventually, we expect Amazon to make this technology available to other retailers.""
The world's biggest online retailer first announced a test of Amazon Go in December 2016, in a challenge to brick-and-mortar rivals that are working to keep their own stores up to date.
However, old practices die hard.
""What we didn't necessarily expect is how many people would stop at the end, on their first trip or two, and ask, 'Is it really OK if I just leave?',"" Puerini said.
She declined to discuss specific expansion plans and said there were no plans to add the technology to Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM), the upscale grocery chain Amazon bought last year. Analysts have speculated otherwise.
In any case, Amazon is still researching how to improve technology at the store.
""If you show a child a can of Coke, you have to show it to them maybe once or twice, and it's very easy for them to be able to recognize it,"" Amazon Vice President Dilip Kumar said in the same interview with Reuters. ""Not so much with computers.""

The company is working to teach computers to recognize items or activities with as little information as possible - a problem that some of Amazon's thousands of experts are addressing, Kumar said.

484,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: 'Where can I buy?' - Google makes push to turn product searches into cash,"By Nandita Bose
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google routinely fields product queries from millions of shoppers. Now it wants to take a cut of their purchases, too.
The U.S. technology company is teaming up with retailers including  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Home Depot  Inc (NYSE:HD), Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and Ulta Beauty Inc.
Under a new program, retailers can list their products on Google Search, as well as on the Google Express shopping service, and Google Assistant on mobile phones and voice devices.
In exchange for Google listings and linking to retailer loyalty programs, the retailers pay Google a piece of each purchase, which is different from payments that retailers make to place ads on Google platforms.
The listings will appear under sponsored shopping results and will not affect regular search results on Google, the company said.
Google's pitch to retailers is a better chance to influence shoppers' purchasing decisions, a move that is likely to help them compete with rival Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). Google hopes the program helps retailers capture more purchases on desktop, cell phones and smart home devices with voice search ‚Äì the next frontier for e-commerce.
The previously unreported initiative sprang from Google's observation that tens of millions of consumers were sending image searches of products, asking ""Where can I buy this?"" ""Where can I find it?"" ""How can I buy it?"" ""How do I transact?"" Daniel Alegre, Google's president for retail and shopping, told Reuters exclusively.
Over the past two years, mobile searches asking where to buy products soared by 85 percent, Alegre said.
But the current default choice for many consumers is a Google search that ends with an Amazon purchase, analysts said. The new Google program, Shopping Actions, will be available in the United States to retailers of all sizes and could help retail chains keep those customers.
""We have taken a fundamentally different approach from the likes of Amazon because we see ourselves as an enabler of retail,"" Alegre said. ""We see ourselves as part of a solution for retailers to be able to drive better transactions ... and get closer to the consumer."" 
For consumers faced with a surfeit of choices, the idea is to make online buying easier by giving them a single shopping cart and instant checkout ‚Äì a core feature of Amazon's retail dominance.
Retail chains can also offer products through the Google Home voice shopping device, holding on to those who may be headed to Amazon for better deals and giving them personalized recommendations based on previous purchase history.
For example, a shopper looking for sneakers on Google on his phone can see a retailer's listing and add that to his Google Express cart. Later, the customer can stand in the kitchen, and use the Google Home voice device to add paper towels to the same cart and buy everything at once.
Retail partners saw the average size of a customer's shopping basket increase by 30 percent, Alegre said, pointing to early results from the Shopping Actions program.
Ulta Beauty's average order value has jumped 35 percent since partnering with Google, Chief Executive Officer Mary Dillon said. Ulta sells makeup and skin care products from brands such as MAC, Estee Lauder and Clinique. 
Over the past six months, Target said the number of items in shoppers' Google Express baskets have increased by nearly 20 percent, on average, as a result of its tie-up with the internet company. 
ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS MY FRIEND 
The retailers are also eager to get in on the rapidly growing voice shopping market dominated by Amazon's popular Echo home device, analysts and consultants said.
Both Walmart and Target last year struck deals to appear in search results via Google Home.
Smart voice devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home will be installed in 55 percent of U.S. households by 2022, according to Juniper Research. Amazon's Alexa platform could generate $10 billion in revenues by 2020, a separate report from RBC Capital Markets estimated.
""Brands are looking at Google as the enemy of the enemy and that makes Google their friend,"" said Guru Hariharan, CEO of retail technology firm Boomerang Commerce, referring to the competition between Amazon and chains like Walmart and Target. 
Target shoppers ""love the ease and convenience of making their Target run without lifting a finger by using a voice interface,"" Chief Information and Digital Officer Mike McNamara said.
""This is just the beginning for Target and Google,"" he added. 

Target shoppers will soon be able to link their online account and loyalty card with their Google accounts and get 5 percent off on purchases and free shipping, McNamara said.

486,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>",Foreign banks step up in Taiwan,"By Evelynn Lin
HONG KONG (LPC) - Taiwan‚Äôs ultra-competitive loan market, dominated by highly-liquid domestic lenders, is turning out to be an unlikely source of opportunities for international banks.
Mizuho Bank is the coordinator on a NT$28.5bn (US$977m) acquisition loan for  Pou Chen  Corp (TW:9904), the world‚Äôs biggest footwear maker, in a rare instance of a Japanese bank leading a high-profile domestic currency loan in Taiwan. 
The five-year loan, which will fund Pou Chen‚Äôs buyout of Chinese sportswear retailer  Pou Sheng International  Holdings (HK:3813), follows a NT$90bn acquisition financing for Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (TW:2311) also with a foreign bank as lead ‚Äì in this case  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
‚ÄúWe are seeing more competition from our overseas counterparts in cross-border acquisition deals as they have branches in Taiwan and they are more experienced in this field, and sentiment is quite positive,‚Äù said a senior loan manager at a top-tier Taiwanese state-owned bank.
On Pou Chen‚Äôs loan, two other Japanese mega banks ‚Äì MUFG and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp ‚Äì are also joint mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners along with Mizuho and Taiwanese lenders Bank of Taiwan, Bank Sinopac, CTBC Bank and Taipei Fubon Commercial Bank.
Mizuho has been a coordinator previously on domestic currency loans in Taiwan, but has not led an acquisition financing since 2014, when it coordinated a NT$5.05bn facility for leasing firm Chailease Finance.
RARITY VALUE
Japanese banks are expanding overseas in search of higher yields than the ultra-thin returns on offer in Japan.
Pou Chen‚Äôs five-year loan offers an interest margin of 50bp over Taibor and a top-level upfront fee of 12.5bp. MUFG and SMBC have also committed to ASE‚Äôs loan, which offers an interest margin of 55bp over Taibor and a top-level fee of 30bp.
Both loans for Pou Chen and ASE come with pre-tax interest rate floors of 1.7%, which is a far more lucrative proposition than most domestic loans in Japan's negative interest rate environment.
‚ÄúIt makes sense that Japanese banks are eyeing offshore deals for better returns,‚Äù said the senior loan manager.
It is not just the Japanese lenders increasing their presence in Taiwan. Around a dozen of the 35 banks committing to ASE‚Äôs giant financing are foreign lenders. 
NT dollar loans are not known for paying juicy returns, given the flush liquidity in the banking system in Taiwan. Still, the blowout response to Pou Chen, with commitments totaling around NT$200bn, shows the appeal of the borrower's strong credit profile and the loan's rarity value. 
Pou Chen makes shoes for international sports brands including  Nike  (NYSE:NKE), Adidas (DE:ADSGN), New Balance and Puma.
Taiwanese lenders also welcome borrowers from the traditional manufacturing sector as an opportunity to diversify beyond the semiconductor industry. 
‚ÄúWe see traditional manufacturing business as more stable than the semiconductor industry,‚Äù said a second loan manager at a state-owned bank looking to take part in Pou Chen‚Äôs financing. 
The loans for Pou Chen and ASE total about US$4.1bn ‚Äì nearly half of the US$8.7bn raised from M&A loans in Taiwan in the last four years. M&A lending peaked at US$5.4bn in 2016. 
‚ÄúWe are happy to see the increase in M&A and leveraged buyout transactions that create fresh net loan supply as we face excessive liquidity,‚Äù said a third Taiwan-based senior loan banker.

487,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>","Zhou Xiaochuan's 15 Years Atop PBOC Leave Legacy of Reform, Debt","(Bloomberg) -- After a record 15-year tenure in which he steered the nation through global crises, overhauled monetary policy tools and oversaw the elevation of the yuan to reserve-currency status, People‚Äôs Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan is riding into the sunset.
Zhou, 70, will hand the reins to his longtime deputy, Yi Gang, 60, leaving him to continue opening financial markets and capital borders and reducing risk after years of soaring debt.
The longest-serving central bank chief in the Group of 20 economies took office when Alan Greenspan was Federal Reserve chairman. The English-speaker explained global concerns to domestic leaders and forged ties around the world to further integrate China into the global financial architecture. He ended the yuan‚Äôs peg to the dollar and started liberalizing interest rates while boosting the economy to become the world‚Äôs second largest.
Zhou‚Äôs tenure spanned four Fed chiefs, three European Central Bank presidents, and premiers Zhu Rongji, Wen Jiabao and Li Keqiang. While lacking the independence of global peers, Zhou used his profile and elevated party rank to push for reform, most recently this month at the National People‚Äôs Congress where he said China ‚Äúcan be bolder in opening up.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent so many years working in the financial system and many things have happened,‚Äù Zhou said with a touch of emotion at the packed briefing room on March 9. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my honor to work with everyone to push ahead with financial reforms and opening up.‚Äù
As China‚Äôs industrial engines cooled, Zhou lowered the one-year lending rate in late 2014 and kept cutting to a record-low 4.35 percent in October 2015, where it remains. That benchmark has been overtaken by newer and more specialized instruments that manage liquidity through different channels, with the seven-day reverse-repurchase rate and the Medium-Term Lending Facility levels now helping to steer borrowing costs.
Zhou, a protege of Zhu, has pushed for a market-based interest-rate system since at least 1993, when he co-wrote a report that envisioned using rates as ‚Äúindirect‚Äù economic tools. In 2013, he eliminated the lower limit on bank lending rates, letting banks set their own. And in 2015, the PBOC scrapped deposit caps, continuing a shift to a system where liquidity is determined by the price of capital.
Zhou steered the yuan into the International Monetary Fund‚Äôs reserve currency basket, which it formally joined Oct. 1, 2016, a major milestone in efforts to build a currency that reflects rising economic and political sway.
Global yuan use has picked up since China ended a U.S. dollar peg in 2005. In recent years, the currency‚Äôs role has been held back as policy makers reinforced capital controls to keep money from flowing out of the country. At the March 9 briefing, Zhou said yuan globalization will be gradual and can be stepped up when capital account restrictions have been lifted.
Zhou has contended with episodes of international criticism that China keeps the currency undervalued, including by U.S. President Donald Trump. Back in 2010, Zhou played tennis in Beijing with Lawrence Summers, then the chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama, and joked that the victor will decide the exchange-rate issue, according to a paper supervised by the official Xinhua News Agency. Zhou won.
China under Zhou became the world‚Äôs largest exporter, thanks in part to relatively low wages in the massive migrant labor pool. That advantage is waning though, and a shrinking working-age population is forcing a shift up the value chain.
Dominating exports helped build the world‚Äôs biggest foreign exchange reserves. Those helped after the 2015 yuan devaluation spurred capital outflows, allowing the PBOC to burn almost $1 trillion of the stockpile to defend the currency. Reserves have stabilized again.
The other side of Zhou‚Äôs legacy is debt. Years of financial repression where low lending rates were subsidized by poor returns for savers helped fuel the rampant growth in corporate debt that authorities are now seeking to contain. Zhou in October warned of a Minsky Moment, where asset values plunge following an era of unsustainable credit growth.
Chen Long, an economist at research firm Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing, said Zhou‚Äôs gradualist approach to reform leaves behind three major challenges: completing interest and exchange rate reform, managing financial risk, and adapting to a bigger global role.
‚ÄúZhou has demonstrated that he can be relied on to maintain stability and accept political realities, making him a smart politician, not simply a technocrat,‚Äù Chen wrote in a recent note. ‚ÄúZhou‚Äôs successor will very likely need to put financial stability over liberalization, and move carefully in defusing risks.‚Äù

488,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 08:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Regulator shopping in vogue as China's shadow banks evade Beijing's grip,"By Engen Tham and Shu Zhang
SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Some of China's biggest shadow banking groups are shopping for regulators in far-flung regions to help pass deals unlikely to be approved by more savvy regulators closer to home, according to multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation.
The trend highlights the difficulties Beijing faces in applying regulations uniformly across the country and the lengths Chinese financiers will go in side-stepping Beijing's ever-tougher crackdown on risk. 
Financial companies and trusts, which are some of the most popular conduits for banks looking to get around tighter lending rules, have been partnering with other firms based as far afield as desert-locked Gansu province, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia.
China's banking regulator, which oversees trust lending, has bureaus in different regions in the country. Far-flung offices are often less sophisticated and tend also to be supportive of their local enterprises, said nine trust employees, two regulators and one lawyer. 
Trust firms, including Ping An Trust, prepare loan documents and hand them over to the remote trust, which submits the documents to its local regulator, said two people with direct knowledge of the practice. 
The fee which can be as high as 0.003 percent of the deal value is paid to the remote trust and the outside trust is listed on the deal as a consultant, said two people who have directly been involved in such deals. 
China has no national database of all deals submitted to the CBRC, so products can be rejected by one bureau and then approved by another, said a person who recently left a regulator.
""Due to resourcing and employee quality issues, it's difficult to prevent there being some looser bureaus and some stricter ones,"" said one current Beijing-based regulator.
CBRC and Ping An Trust did not respond to requests for comment.
TRUSTING
The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) is set up on a regional basis, with each bureau overseeing financial firms registered directly in their area. 
Regional bureaus have very different workloads and experience dealing with complex structured lending.
""In Shanghai, the regulator sees right through to what you're hiding,"" said one employee at a trust in Shanghai. 
The Shanghai CBRC bureau has around 230 employees, while the northern Chinese region of Hebei's bureau has around 200 employees, according to staff there. 
While the difference in the number of employees is not large, there are seven trust firms and 23 banks registered in Shanghai giving staff ample experience, whereas Hebei only has 11 lenders and one trust firm to oversee - Bohai International Trust.
Bohai International Trust has seen an increase in enquiries from financiers for services this year, said one person with direct knowledge.
""The standard is the same in all bureaus, but with every project, there is always room to maneuver, to understand the deal,"" said the source. ""In Shanghai, the process of reporting projects is very formalized."" By contrast, the source said that in smaller cities ""you can pick up the phone, make a call and explain."" 
Wanxiang Trust - registered in Hangzhou - is another company which has seen an increase in inquiries from financial firms facing tougher regulations this year, said one person with direct knowledge.
""Sometimes it's a case of local protectionism. Local bureaus will protect business interests in the area,"" said the person.
Bohai did not respond to requests for comment, while Wanxiang Trust could not be reached for comment.
If there are differences in regional bureaus then ""it definitely means that implementation quality is not so good,"" said Richard Cao, an analyst at Guotai Junan Research. 
REGULATOR SWAPPING
The shadow-banking sector has been put under the microscope as China's regulators increase efforts to curb risk in the financial sector.
Total trust assets hit 24 trillion yuan ($3.80 trillion) at the end of September last year, over 30 percent higher than in September 2016, according to official numbers. 
Growth increased in the first three quarters of last year as competitors of trust firm were hobbled by tougher regulations. 
The crackdown is set to get even more severe this year, as prohibitive new asset management rules and the merger of the banking and insurance regulators helps close regulatory loopholes.
This has led the country's shadow bankers to shop for more sympathetic regulators while the gaps still exist, said several sources.
It has also pushed insurers to team up with trusts, because their regulator, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), is seen as being stricter than its banking counterpart in approving financial products, said two people at two different trusts and one person at an asset manager connected to a major insurer actively looking for a trust firm. 
In order for an insurer to issue a product, it has to get a certificate from the CIRC and the assets backing the product will be scrutinized, the sources said. 
Meanwhile, at the banking regulator, for the same product issued by a trust firm, no certificate is necessary, and the assets backing the product won't be scrutinized, they added. 
But many are aware that these channels won't stay open for much longer.
""I give it another three months,"" said one person who works at a trust firm in Shanghai. 
The CIRC did not respond to requests for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Share markets were stuck on their worst run since November on Monday, as caution gripped traders in a week in which the Federal Reserve is likely to raise U.S. interest rates and perhaps signal as many as three more lie in store this year.
A 0.6-1.2 percent drop for Europe's main bourses <0#.INDEXE> amid a flurry of gloomy company news (EU) and weaker Wall Street futures (ESc1) meant MSCI's main 47-country world stocks index (MIWD00000PUS) was down for a fifth day.
The caution also came against the backdrop of global trade war worries which are set to dominated a two-day G20 meeting starting later in Argentina and there were plenty of idiosyncratic factors in play too. 
London's FTSE (FTSE) was down almost double the rest Europe as a savage profit warning wiped more than half the value off one of its big tech firms and weak international commodity markets hit oil and gas firms and miners. (L)
The pound, though, was having its best day in almost two months against the euro (EURGBP=) as Britain's Brexit negotiators appeared to be nearing a 'transition' deal with soon-to-be-former EU colleagues in Brussels.
The euro also fell against the dollar as bond markets sent the gap between 10-year German and U.S. government yields, referred to as the 'transatlantic spread', out to its widest since December 2016. (DE10YT=RR) (US10YT=RR).
Many analysts had been expecting that spread to be narrowing as the ECB nears the end of its stimulus program, but it hasn't proved the case. The shorter-dated 2-year borrowing cost gap is near its widest level in over 20 years. (DE2YT=RR) (US2YT=RR)
""There has been the narrative of supposed policy convergence between the ECB and the Fed, but that is just not the reality,"" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy.
With as many as four hikes seen this year, expectations were ""chomping at the max"" he added. ""I think the euro 'longs' have good reason to be nervous,"" he said referring to those betting on a higher euro.
Weakness in equity markets was almost worldwide. Japan's Nikkei (N225) had ended down almost 1 percent as its exporters were hit by more strength in the yen which was up for a third session in the last four. 
The rest of Asia had struggled too (MIAPJ0000PUS), though China (CSI300) did manage to eke out some gains as Beijing announced a new economic team.
It included a surprise new central bank chief but for the most part was largely as anticipated and is expected to keep the focus on halting riskier types of lending in the giant economy.
FED AHEAD
Wall Street look set to lose more ground when New York reopens having seen the Dow (DJI) lose 1.57 percent last week, the S&P (SPX) drop 1.04 percent and the Nasdaq (IXIC) 1.27 percent.
Shares in social media site Facebook (O:FB) were down 3.7 percent in premarket trading after reports that data of 50 million of its users were misused by a political consultancy firm ahead of the 2016 U.S. elections and Brexit vote.
Twitter (N:TWTR) dropped 1.6 percent, while Snapchat-owner Snap (N:SNAP) was off 0.7 percent.
For the year so far, the BAML figures last week showed $9.8 billion has gone into tech stocks, while $41 billion has flowed into emerging markets and $31 billion into Japan.
Whether the cash continues to flow could depend on what the Fed decides on Wednesday. All 104 analysts polled by Reuters expected the Fed would raise rates to between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent on Wednesday.
They were less certain on whether the ""dot plot"" forecasts of committee members will stay at three hikes this year or shift higher.
It will also be the first press conference for new Fed Chair Jerome Powell. ""Expected is a confident Fed Chair, both with respect to the economy's strength and the Fed's approach to policy,"" said analysts at Westpac in a note. ""Gradual and timely are the operative words for policy.""
Analysts at JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), however, see a risk the Fed might not only add one more rate rise for this year but for 2019 as well.
""The worst case is the ‚Äô18 and ‚Äô19 dots both move up - the Fed is currently guiding to five hikes in ‚Äô18 and ‚Äô19 combined but under this scenario that would shift to seven hikes,"" they warned in a note to clients.
""Stocks would probably tolerate one net dot increase over ‚Äô18 and ‚Äô19 but a bump in both years could create problems.""
DOLLAR DIVIDED
Any nod to four hikes would normally be considered as bullish for the U.S. dollar, yet the currency has shown scant overall correlation to interest rates in recent months. 
Reasons cited by dealers include concerns about the U.S. budget and current account deficits, political chaos at the White House, better growth in competing countries, particularly Europe, and the risk of a U.S.-led trade war.
Trade will be top of the agenda at a two-day G20 meeting starting later on Monday in Buenos Aires and any signs of escalating stress between the U.S. and China could make investors in Asia nervous.
As U.S. trading began, the dollar had recovered to 106.23 yen  having been as low as 105.69 overnight though it had begun to wilt against the euro which left it around 0.3 percent weaker against a basket of currencies at just below 90. (DXY)
The prospect of higher U.S. interest rates was been a burden for non-yielding gold, which slipped 0.8 percent last week. On the day, the metal  was down at $1,311.20 per ounce.

Oil prices eased after ending last week with a solid bounce. Brent futures (LCOc1) dropped as much as 40 cents to $65.81 a barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) futures for April, which expire on Tuesday, dipped as far as 36 cents to $61.98 a barrel.

490,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 02:07AM ET</span>",Hyundai Motor shares slide following U.S. probe of air bag failures,"By Hyunjoo Jin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Shares in Hyundai Motor tumbled on Monday on a U.S. probe into why air bags failed to deploy in some of its Sonata sedans, with investors fretting about potential recall costs for the once popular cars.
The probe, which follows crashes that reportedly killed four people and left six injured, will review the 2011 Sonata sedan as well as the 2012-2013 Forte made by affiliate Kia Motors Corp, encompassing some 425,000 vehicles. 
It marks the second investigation by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration into the South Korean duo in less than one year, exacerbating headaches for Hyundai which reported in January its worst annual earnings in seven years.
Hyundai issued a recall last month for more than 150,000 U.S. Sonatas after incidents of non-deployment were linked to electrical overstress in the air-bag control unit, but said it did not have a final fix. 
""What I am concerned about is that the recall will be expanded to other markets,"" said Ko Tae-bong, an analyst at Hi Investment & Securities.
The Sonata and Forte sedans were responsible for driving sales for Hyundai and Kia in key markets in recent years, although they are no longer as popular as they once were.
Ko estimated the U.S. recall could cost as much as $575 million if air bags were replaced in 425,000 vehicles under review and the automakers were found responsible for the problem.
Hyundai Motor shares tumbled 4.8 percent while Kia Motors lost 3.7 percent. Parts supplier Hyundai Mobis fell 5.4 percent while the broader market was down 0.7 percent. 
Hyundai declined to comment on whether the recall would be expanded. Kia said it has not confirmed problems with the air bags but added it would ""act promptly to conduct a safety recall, if it determines that a recall would be appropriate.""
The automakers told the South Korean regulator that the Sonata and Forte models sold in the domestic market were not affected, an official at South Korea's transport ministry told Reuters.
The U.S. regulator said the air bag control units were built by ZF Friedrichshafen-TRW, a German auto supplier that acquired TRW Automotive in 2015, adding that it would determine if any other manufacturers used similar air bag control units and if they posed a safety risk.
The NHTSA also said that electrical overstress appeared to be the root cause in the 2016 recall by Fiat Chrysler America of 1.4 million U.S. vehicles for air bag non-deployments in significant frontal crashes.
Other problems on Hyundai's plate include profit declines on its delayed response to the burgeoning SUV market and a diplomatic row with China.
Its U.S. sales fell 12 percent over January and February, compared with an average industry-wide market that was down 1 percent.

Last May, the NHTSA opened a formal investigation into the recall of nearly 1.7 million vehicles by Hyundai and Kia over engine defects. That followed concerns raised by a South Korean whistleblower with the regulator in 2016 that Hyundai had concealed defects and that recalls were not issued in a timely manner.

492,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 07:11PM ET</span>",Disputes with temporary workers add to GM Korea's challenges,"By Hyunjoo Jin and Ju-min Park
BUPYEONG, South Korea (Reuters) - Having lost his temporary job as a mechanist at GM Korea twice in the past eight years, Shin Hyun-chang was eagerly awaiting a court ruling last month on whether the automaker would be forced to recognize him as a full-time employee.
While the Feb. 13 verdict came out in favor of Shin and 44 temporary co-workers, there were no big celebrations: Earlier that day, Detroit-based General Motors (N:GM) had suddenly announced it was shutting one of its South Korean plants with the loss of 2,000 jobs and was reviewing the future of its remaining three factories.
""I asked myself 'why is my life so gloomy? Nothing is going right',"" Shin told Reuters at a protest tent set up outside the Bupyeong GM factories in the suburbs of Seoul. 
""I moved one step closer to achieving my goal of becoming a regular worker, but the jobs that can help me get there may disappear soon.""
Shin said he was one of 600 temporary workers at GM Korea fired since December via a mobile phone message and without any severance package. 
GM Korea has appealed the Feb. 13 ruling that GM Korea should recognize the temporary workers as full-time employees, and Shin and his co-workers have not been reinstated, court documents show. 
The legal battle adds to challenges for the automaker as it works through difficult restructuring negotiations with the government, shareholders and unions and as some 1,600 jittery temporary workers still on GM Korea's payroll worry they will be hardest hit.
‚ÄúWe are concerned that the litigation could add to the labor cost burden,"" a GM Korea spokesman told Reuters. ""We will continuously discuss the structural cost issues with the labor union during ongoing wage negotiations.‚Äù
GM Korea's principle was ""to flexibly manage subcontracting deals according to production plans,"" he added.
WORKERS' PLIGHT
The use of temporary workers by automakers around the world is commonplace, but in South Korea, where laying off full-time and unionised workers is particularly difficult, GM Korea and local peers such as  Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380) have turned to temporary workers to a greater extent. 
Temporary workers account for 22 percent of the total workforce in South Korea, second only to Spain among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member states and double the OECD average. 
Temporary auto factory workers do similar work to regular workers, but get paid only 50 to 60 percent of full-time employees' salary, said Jung Heung-jun, a researcher at state-funded Korea Labor Institute. That is far lower than the 80 to 90 percent temporary auto workers overseas receive, he said.
With GM Korea's production expected to fall by a quarter to just 42 percent of its peak production next year, according to an internal company forecast seen by Reuters, more temporary jobs are likely to be affected.
""Whenever crisis comes, we are the ones removed first,"" said Hwang Ho-in, a forklift truck driver at GM's Bupyeong plant, who joined protesting workers spending freezing winter nights camped outside the plant in makeshift shelters, sustained by instant cup noodles and bottled water. 
Outside the tent a banner reads, ""The Moon Jae-in government! Are you going to just watch massive lay-offs at GM Korea?"" 
BETTER JOB SECURITY? 
South Korea's President Moon, who took office last May, had pledged to provide better job security for temporary workers, promising to encourage companies to change the status of temporary workers into full-time employees.
However, officials say the government faces resistance from businesses and conservative politicians worried about rising labor costs.
""People can blame GM's firing of temp workers on moral grounds, but not on legal reasons,"" a government official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to the media. 
""Without legal grounds, the government can't pressure the private sector,"" the official said. 
While temporary workers get no severance packages, GM Korea's 2,500 regular employees who signed up for voluntary redundancy scheme earlier this month will get three times their annual base salary, their children‚Äôs college tuition fees paid and a $9,000 voucher towards a new car.
The number of subcontracted or dispatched workers at GM's Bupyeong plant slumped by 58 percent in 2017 versus 2014, compared to just 5 percent for regular workers, according to South Korea's labor ministry data. 
Amid fears over further layoffs, temporary workers at GM are now losing hope.
""What we want first is to keep our jobs, rather than becoming regular workers or not,"" said a frustrated Shin.

493,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>","Top executive resigns from Cohen's Point72 after lawsuit, fundraising","By Lawrence Delevingne
(Reuters) - Douglas Haynes has resigned as president of Point72 Asset Management LP, a spokeswoman for billionaire Steven Cohen's investment firm said on Sunday, as the company and Haynes face a lawsuit claiming women are subject to a hostile working environment.
The resignation on Friday comes after Stamford, Connecticut-based Point72 successfully raised $3 billion from outside investors for its relaunch as a traditional hedge fund manager.
Cohen told employees in an email on Friday that Haynes' departure followed his leadership of the firm as a so-called family office for Cohen's fortune and its reopening to outside money in January after being banned from taking public money. 
‚ÄúWith these milestones achieved, Doug and I have taken stock and agreed that this is a natural point to make way for a new, different type of leader,"" Cohen said in the email, according to the spokeswoman.
Cohen's former hedge fund firm, SAC Capital Advisors LP, pleaded guilty in an insider trading case in 2014. Cohen was not charged by U.S. authorities, but accepted the two-year ban from managing public money. 
Haynes, a former McKinsey & Co executive who joined Point72 in early 2014 to help reshape the firm, did not respond to an email seeking comment on his resignation.
In February, Lauren Bonner, an associate director focused on employee performance, said in a lawsuit that ""structural sexism"" pervades Point72, where women are denigrated by high-level employees, including Haynes. He was named as a defendant along with the firm and Cohen.
Cohen was not accused of inappropriate behavior in Bonner's lawsuit.
The firm's view ""remains that (the sexism lawsuit) is without merit,"" the Point72 spokeswoman said on Sunday. Cohen hired law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP to conduct an independent assessment of the firm's practices. 
‚ÄúSteve Cohen wants to make sure that his firm is living up to its stated values and fostering a respectful workplace,"" the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

Haynes' departure was previously reported by Bloomberg and the New York Times.

494,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 07:40PM ET</span>",Republican lawmakers concerned by Facebook data leak,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several U.S. Republican lawmakers expressed concern over privacy violations on Sunday after media reports that a political consultancy that worked on President Donald Trump's campaign gained inappropriate access to 50 million Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users' data.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio said he believed some internet companies have grown too fast to digest their responsibilities and obligations.
""So we'll learn more about this in the days to come. But yeah I'm disturbed by that,"" Rubio told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
Senator Rand Paul was asked whether people can trust companies like Facebook in the wake of the report about Cambridge Analytica taking data.
""People have to look into it. Whether or not it broke the law, absolutely, the privacy of the American consumer, the American individual, should be protected,"" Paul said on CNN.
Facebook disclosed the issue in a blog post on Friday, hours before media reports that conservative-leaning Cambridge Analytica, a data company known for its work on Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was given access to the data and may not have deleted it. 
Facebook said in a statement that a Cambridge University psychology professor had lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from an app he had developed. It suspended the firm from Facebook.
Facebook did not immediately reply when asked on Sunday for a response to the lawmakers' comments. However, in a new statement Sunday, the company said it was conducting a ""comprehensive internal and external review"" to determine if the user data in question still existed.
Cambridge Analytica and the professor have denied violating Facebook's terms, according to media reports.
The scrutiny presented a new threat to Facebook's reputation, which was already under attack over Russians' use of Facebook tools to sway American voters before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.
Republican Senator Jeff Flake said he had a lot of questions about the data taken from Facebook, including who knew it had been taken and whether it is still being used.
""This is a big deal, when you have that amount of data, and the privacy violations there are significant,"" he told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. ""So the question is who knew it and when did they know it, how long did this go on and what happens to that data now.""
Facebook faced new calls for regulation from Democratic senators on Saturday and was hit with questions about personal data safeguards, but it was unclear whether the Republican-controlled Congress would act. 
U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said more investigation was needed.
""We need to find out what we can about the misappropriation of the privacy, the private information of tens of millions of Americans,"" he said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week.""

Also on ABC, Senator James Lankford, a Republican, said it was not known whether the incident was connected to the Trump campaign.

495,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2018 12:29AM ET</span>",CACI seeks to break up General Dynamics' acquisition of CSRA,"By Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) - U.S. defense contractor CACI International Inc said on Sunday it had offered to merge with larger peer CSRA Inc, seeking to disrupt the latter's $6.8 billion acquisition by General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD).
The move comes after CSRA agreed last month to sell itself to General Dynamics, another defense contractor, for $40.75 per share in cash, as companies in the sector seek to position themselves for a pickup in government spending under U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.
CACI's shares have jumped by more than a fifth in the last four months, emboldening the Arlington, Virginia-based company to use its stock as currency to pursue a transformative deal. CACI has a market capitalization of $3.9 billion, compared with CSRA's $6.7 billion.
CACI's $44 per share offer for CSRA consists of $15 per share in cash and 0.184 CACI shares for each CSRA share, CACI said in a statement. Under the terms of CACI's offer, CSRA shareholders would own 55 percent of the combined company.
CACI said it expects to realize $165 million annually in net run-rate cost synergies, beating the cost benefits of CSRA's deal with General Dynamics. It also argued its stock would make the deal more attractive to CSRA shareholders. 
CSRA said on Sunday that its board of directors, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, will carefully review CACI's proposal. General Dynamics' tender offer is currently scheduled to expire on April 3.
General Dynamics said later on Sunday it believes its all-cash offer is superior to CSRA shareholders and that it intends to proceed with the offer to buy CSRA.
""General Dynamics has secured all necessary regulatory approvals and has the funding in place to complete the transaction in early April,"" it said in a statement.
CSRA provides information technology and related services to the U.S. Department of Defense and the intelligence community. General Dynamics is hoping that CSRA will help it grab more of the recently increased U.S. defense budget. Under the terms of their deal, CSRA would have to pay General Dynamics a $204 million breakup fee to do a deal with someone else.
CACI has also been seeking to build scale through dealmaking. In 2016, it acquired the government services division of L3 Technologies Inc for $550 million in cash. It also made an unsuccessful offer to merge with  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Corp's government information technology and services businesses.
Other recent deals in the sector include U.S. defense contractor  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC) Corp's agreement last September to buy Orbital ATK Inc for about $7.8 billion, a deal that gives it greater access to lucrative government contracts and expands its arsenal of missile defense systems and space rockets.

CACI on Sunday also raised its 2018 diluted earnings per share guidance from its previous $10.95 to $11.19 range to a new range of between $11.26 and $11.50.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 08:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Qatar asks U.S. to investigate UAE bank for 'financial warfare',"By Dmitry Zhdannikov
LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar has asked U.S. regulators to investigate the U.S. subsidiary of the largest bank in the United Arab Emirates, accusing it of ""bogus"" foreign exchange deals designed to harm its economy as part of a blockade by Gulf neighbors.
The Central Bank of Qatar's law firm has written a letter to the U.S. Treasury asking it to investigate NBAD Americas, the U.S. subsidiary of First Abu Dhabi¬†Bank (FAB) (AD:FAB), which is majority state-owned.
In a second letter, the lawyers - Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison - asked the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to investigate possible manipulation of Qatar's currency, the riyal.
The request for an investigation deepens the diplomatic crisis that erupted in June when Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain imposed an economic boycott on Qatar, accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and Iran.
""We believe NBAD has participated in an extraordinary and unlawful scheme to wage financial warfare against Qatar, including through the manipulation of Qatari currency and securities markets,"" said the letter to the U.S. Treasury dated Feb. 26, which has been seen by Reuters.
""These actions should be halted immediately, and we ask that you investigate whether NBAD has directly or indirectly supported the manipulation of Qatar's markets, including through NBAD America's dollar-clearing or correspondent banking services in the United States,"" the letter said. 
FAB, which was created from the merger of First Gulf Bank and National Bank of Abu Dhabi last year, did not respond to questions about details of the allegations.
""As the UAE's largest bank and one of the world's largest and safest financial institutions, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) works closely with all of its regulators in the markets in which it operates, to sustain and uphold the high standards of governance and regulatory compliance across the group,"" it said.
The UAE government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A Qatari government spokesman confirmed the letters had been sent to U.S. regulators but declined to comment on their content. New York-based law firm Paul, Weiss declined to comment.
The U.S. Treasury and CFTC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
DIPLOMATIC PUSH
Qatar's central bank said in December it had launched an investigation into possible manipulation of its markets by the countries that had imposed the economic blockade.
Qatar, a small Gulf state and major gas exporter, denies the allegations that it has financed terrorism and says the blockade is an attempt to punish Doha for independent policies.
The UAE and Saudi Arabia have refused to soften their demands - which include Qatar cutting ties with Iran and shutting down state-funded broadcaster Al Jazeera.
Qatar, which is also home to the largest U.S. military base in the region, has repeatedly reached out to Washington to mediate in the crisis but the attempts have failed so far.
Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump, who has previously accused Qatar of sponsoring terrorism, sacked U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who had publicly defended Qatar and pressured Trump to moderate his stance.
Tillerson's sacking came ahead of a new diplomatic push to help mediate the dispute among America's Gulf allies.
The United States is due to host a Gulf Cooperation Council summit later this year and before that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani are all due in Washington for separate state visits.
'BOGUS QUOTES'
The Qatari central bank has previously accused unnamed banks of trying to manipulate the riyal by trading it between themselves offshore at artificially weak levels - to create an illusion Qatar's economy was crumbling.
The riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 3.64 for more than a decade, but in the initial months of the boycott it traded as low as 3.8950 offshore. 
In the letter to the U.S. Treasury, Qatar's lawyers said they suspected NBAD was driving the riyal lower during illiquid periods, such as Islam's Eid al-Adha holidays last year, ""reinforcing the manufactured narrative that Qatar's currency was increasingly volatile and its economy was too unstable for investment"".
""NBAD's quotes - and those of other banks involved in the manipulation - were likely all bogus,"" the letter said without naming the banks and referring to foreign exchange quotes posted by NBAD.
""There is evidence that at the same time NBAD was providing quotes with great frequency and at rates lower than the official rate of 3.64, its traders were unwilling to actually transact at those prices,"" the letter said.
It cited one example on Nov. 22, 2017: when a counterparty reached out to NBAD to execute a deal, it was told by a representative of NBAD that it had no riyal to trade.
FAB declined to comment when asked about the specific allegation.
The letter did not name the counterparty but said the central bank's lawyers were ready to provide regulators with a recorded chat between the two sides, on a confidential basis. It said NBAD stopped quoting the riyal in December after Qatar vowed to investigate.
The central bank also pledged on Nov. 23 to satisfy any market demand for dollars and the riyal has since rebounded in offshore transactions to trade close to its peg.

Many bankers in the region say that with more than $300 billion in central bank reserves and sovereign wealth fund assets, Qatar has more than enough financial firepower to block any attack on its currency.

499,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 18, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>","Ten years after crash, Americans still have not fallen back in love with stocks","By David Randall and April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Luke Thomas, 44, an information technology field manager who lives in Miami, began investing in the U.S. stock market in his early 20s, attracted by the prospect of learning ‚Äúhow to grow a little bit of money into a lot,‚Äù he said.
At the time, he put most of his money into a handful of small-cap and over-the-counter stocks. Yet watching the Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies fall more than 60 percent during the 2008-2009 financial crisis scared him into diversifying his portfolio. He now invests in large-cap stocks, real estate, options, and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, spreading his risk over several asset classes. 
‚ÄúA younger Luke would have focused 90 percent on crypto, putting all my eggs in one basket. But this way, I‚Äôm not overly exposed,‚Äù he said. 
Thomas is not alone in his hesitation to make big bets. 
Ten years after the start of the financial crisis that erased $16.4 trillion in assets from U.S. households, Americans have yet to embrace the U.S. stock market with the same fervor as before, holding fewer individual stocks and putting less money into equities overall despite an uninterrupted 9-year bull market that has pushed the S&P 500 up nearly 310 percent from its 2009 lows.
Overall, U.S. households have $900 billion less invested in stocks than in 2007, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) research, leaving buying by U.S. corporations now the greatest driver of demand. In 401(k) retirement plans, meanwhile, investors now hold an average of 52.4 percent in equity-only funds, down from the 64.7 percent they held in 2007, according to Fidelity.
Instead, investors now hold an average of 33.2 percent of their assets in blended target-date funds that combine stocks, bonds and cash based on a person's expected retirement date, more than double the 14.5 percent of assets invested in the category in 2007.
The decline in the assets invested in stocks comes even as investors have largely benefited from the recovery in equity prices. The average 401(k) balance at the end of 2017 was $104,300, up 112 percent from the average of $49,000 at the end of 2008 and up 54 percent from the pre-crisis average of $67,600 at the end of 2007, according to Fidelity. 
""There just doesn't seem to be the same level of interest or animal spirits"" among investors now for equities, said Mark Paccione, director of investment research at Raleigh, North Carolina-based Captrust Financial Advisors, which oversees $250 billion in assets. 
Clients are much more concerned about the effect of rising interest rates and inflation on their bond portfolios, he said.
""They're very worried we will have a bear market in bonds and direct almost all of their focus there,"" he said. 
ERA OF STOCK-PICKING LOOKS OVER
Investors are not only holding fewer assets in stocks overall, but those dollars that are invested in the market are increasingly likely to be put into index funds or exchange-traded funds that track broad indexes rather than in individual shares or funds that are run by a stockpicker. 
Financial advisors say that the push is driven by clients who lost trust in the ability of professional fund managers after nearly all of them failed to anticipate the financial crisis. 
""Index investing is more prevalent than it's ever been, and that's because active management didn't protect you from losses during the crisis and has underperformed over the last 10 years,"" said Matt Hanson, a senior wealth advisor at Los-Angeles based Kayne Anderson Rudnick, which oversees approximately $18.9 billion in assets. 
Passive funds now comprise about 46 percent of total mutual fund and ETF assets, compared with just 8 percent in early 2008, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. There are now 1,400 passively managed equity mutual funds and ETFs, with a total of $5.4 trillion in assets, compared with 707 funds holding $1.2 trillion in 2007, according to Lipper data. That push toward passive investing has helped make index-based fund providers BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and privately-held Vanguard the world's two largest money managers.
The growth rates of the trading of options are accelerating faster at brokers such as E Trade Financial and TD Ameritrade than they are for the trading of individual equity shares, said Mac Sykes, an analyst at Gabelli & Co. Monthly stock trading volume for the NYSE Group, meanwhile, was 43 percent lower in 2017 than in 2007, according to NYSE data. 
Instead of the day-traders of the 1990s dot-com craze or the house-flippers of the mid-2000s, small-scale investors say they are looking for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to deliver the outsized returns they no longer believe the stock market can deliver. 
Layla Tabatabaie, an entrepreneur and advisor to tech startups who lives in New York, began investing in initial coin offerings, or ICOs, about a year and a half ago, she said. She now holds the majority of her portfolio in cryptocurrencies, which she sees as offering the possibility for greater gains.

‚ÄúThe way that I see crypto as being more favorable than stocks is it seems like there is more of an opportunity for retail investors to get in earlier,"" she said. ""Crypto now is taking the place of the way stocks used to behave 10 years ago, 15 years ago.""

(Reuters) - Chinese video streaming service provider iQiyi Inc, a unit of search engine giant Baidu Inc (O:BIDU), has launched an initial public offering in New York worth up to $2.4 billion, seeking to expand its range of content.
The listing is expected to give the firm extra financial muscle as it squares off against rivals in the Chinese market, including  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd's (N:BABA) service Youku Tudou Inc.
It plans to offer 125 million American depositary shares priced at $17 to $19 each, the company said in a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Underwriters have an option to sell an additional 18.75 million shares, which if exercised in full could bring the value of the deal to about $2.7 billion.
IQiyi, which will list on the Nasdaq, said it expects to use about half of the proceeds to broaden and enhance its content offering while 10 percent would be earmarked to strengthen technology. The rest would go towards general corporate purposes.
Baidu owns 69.6 percent of the Netflix-like video platform and will continue to be its controlling shareholder upon completion of the offering, iQiyi said. 
At the end of February, iQiyi had 60.1 million subscribers, over 98 percent of whom were paying members, it said. 
IQiyi saw its 2017 revenue jump to 17.38 billion yuan ($2.7 billion), a gain of 55 percent over the previous year. It made a net loss of 3.74 billion yuan.
Bilibili, another Chinese video streaming company, also set tentative pricing for its New York listing, seeking to raise as up to $525 million.
Its depository shares will be offered in a range of $10.50 to $12.50 each. The deal includes an option for an additional 6.3 million shares to be sold.

(This story corrects paragraph 6 to say Baidu owns a 69.6 percent of iQiyi, not 80.5 percent.)

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Unions representing Ryanair pilots across Europe have signed a deal to cooperate in a move that could raise the prospect of coordinated action, something its management has been keen to avoid.
In the agreement signed on Saturday, the unions decided to form a transnational pilot group to negotiate with Ryanair at a pan-European level, the European Cockpit Association said.
Ryanair is in talks to formalize union recognition in several European countries but it has refused requests to engage with pilots on a pan-European basis.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""It is now up to Ryanair to take this great new opportunity to reach out to its pilots and engage in genuine social dialogue,"" Dirk Polloczek, president of the ECA, said in a statement posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""Today is a historic day for Ryanair pilots in their quest for fair and equitable working conditions. And it is a great day for unity among the European pilot community,"" he said.
The airline averted widespread strikes ahead of Christmas last year by announcing plans to recognize pilots' unions for the first time in its 32-year history and is talking with unions across Europe on formal recognition.
Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said Ryanair was close to concluding agreements in Spain and Italy, but was struggling in Ireland and in Portugal.

By the end of the decade three new production sites will come on stream: compact models will be assembled in Aguascalientes, Mexico from the third quarter of this year; a new site in Kecskemet, Hungary, will be built by end-2019; and the company is planning to add a second site in Beijing, Automobilwoche said.
Total investment in these projects amounts to 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion), it added.

The German automaker said last month that an expected rise in unit sales and revenue in 2018 will be countered by spending on new cars and technologies, forecasting earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) at a similar level as 2017.

511,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2018 10:01PM ET</span>","U.S. probes air bag failures in deadly Hyundai, Kia car crashes","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Saturday it is opening a probe into why some air bags failed to deploy in Hyundai and Kia vehicles after crashes in which four people were reportedly killed and another six injured. 
The agency said it was reviewing 425,000 2012-2013 Kia Forte and 2011 Hyundai Sonata cars. It also said it will determine if any other manufacturers used similar air bag control units and if they posed a safety risk. 
Hyundai Motor Co issued a recall last month for 154,753 U.S. Sonatas after non-deployment reports were linked to electrical overstress in the air bag control unit, but said it did not have a final fix yet.
Hyundai spokesman Jim Trainor said the South Korean automaker is aware of reports of two deaths in its vehicles, which he said occurred in head-on collisions at extremely high rates of speed. Trainor said the automaker is working with NHTSA in the investigation, and that it has not seen any issues with any vehicle apart from the 2011 Sonata.
""We are working on getting the fix as fast we can,"" Trainor said.
NHTSA, which announced the start of the probe in documents posted on a government website, said it was aware of six crashes in which six people were injured when air bags failed to deploy in frontal crashes, including four in 2011 Hyundai Sonatas and two in 2012 and 2013 Kia Fortes. The 2013 Forte crash occurred in Canada.
The agency said the air bag control module was built by ZF Friedrichshafen-TRW, a German auto supplier that acquired TRW Automotive Holdings Corp in 2015. 
""ZF is aware of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's recently announced investigation,"" a ZF spokesman said in a statement. ""ZF continues to work with its customers and NHTSA to support the ongoing investigation.""
NHTSA said it believed that the 2012-2013 Forte cars also use similar air bag control units supplied by ZF-TRW.
Kia Motors Corp said in a statement it has ""carefully monitored the quality and safety performance of the 2012-2013 Kia Forte.""
The company added it ""has not confirmed any airbag non-deployments arising from the potential chip issue."" Kia said it will work closely with NHTSA on the investigation, ""including monitoring and conducting additional crash testing as appropriate.""
The agency also said that electrical overstress appeared to be the root cause in a 2016 recall by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles of 1.4 million U.S. vehicles for air bag non-deployments in significant frontal crashes.
In 2014, Hyundai agreed to pay a $17.35 million fine to settle a NHTSA investigation into delays in the recall of 43,500 Genesis cars to fix a brake defect. NHTSA said in 2014 Hyundai ""must change the way they deal with safety-related defects."" Hyundai vowed to make improvements.

In 2017, NHTSA opened a formal investigation into the recall of nearly 1.7 million vehicles by Hyundai and Kia over engine defects. A South Korean whistleblower reported concerns in 2016 to NHTSA, which is probing the timeliness of three recalls carried out in the United States and whether they covered enough vehicles.

CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Toys 'R' Us secured a $3.1 billion bankruptcy loan in September, toy makers were reassured they would be paid for goods delivered to the company as it tried to emerge from Chapter 11.
Now those payments are at risk in a dramatic turn of events as the iconic toy retailer speeds toward U.S. liquidation.
More than a dozen executives, specialists and lawyers interviewed by Reuters said they expected many small vendors to go bankrupt due to the disappearance of Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us in the United States.
While the downfall of Toys 'R' Us came quickly in the United States, the Wayne, New Jersey-based retailer is still trying to find a buyer for its businesses in Canada, Europe and Asia. In the meantime, it wants to keep stores stocked to maintain customers and value. 
""We have a $14-$15 million payment due that hasn't been paid,"" Isaac Larian, chief executive of Bratz dolls maker MGA Entertainment, said. ""If I was a guessing man, I wouldn't think I'd get all of it back."" 
MGA, whose L.O.L. Surprise! toys were the industry's top seller last year, stopped supplying goods to Toys 'R' Us on Wednesday, Larian said. Toys 'R' Us accounted for 15 percent of MGA's annual sales. Larian spent Thursday and Friday on the phone with his lawyers and tending to a bid he and other vendors have made to acquire Toys 'R' Us' Canadian operations. 
‚ÄúI have been working from 4 a.m. till midnight every day on this talking to other toy company executives, lawyers, bankers, other retailers,"" Larian said. ""I‚Äôm exhausted.‚Äù 
At a Thursday hearing at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Virginia, vendor lawyers said they were receiving hourly calls from clients about hundreds of millions of dollars of claims. Whether or not they receive payment will depend on the outcome of the liquidation proceedings.
For some, the writing for Toys 'R' Us had been on the wall. Marc Wagman, who heads insurance broker Gallagher's (N:AJG) U.S. trade credit and political risk business, said credit insurers stopped covering Toys 'R' Us in the first and second quarters of 2017. 
""Unfortunately, for a lot of these toy companies, Toys 'R' Us represented a means of testing consumer taste, a big retail opportunity and, for some, accounted for 20-40 percent of revenue. How that's going to be replaced remains to be seen,"" Wagman said.
Toys 'R' Us, with $11 billion in annual revenue and shops up to 50,000 square feet (4,600 square meters) in size, was the last major specialty toy retailer, a loss not only for small, innovative toy makers that relied on it as a showcase, but also for brands such as Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) that rolled out products with partner labels for blockbuster films like ""Frozen"" and some of the ""Star Wars"" series.
'I'M LOSING A LOT OF BUSINESS'
‚ÄúI have a short-term concern about the loss of business, the loss of one of my best partners over many, many decades,"" said Joseph Shamie, president of Delta Children, one of the chain‚Äôs biggest vendors of children‚Äôs furniture, with roughly 470 employees. 
He has been selling to Toys 'R' Us for more than 40 years, since he was 19. ""I‚Äôm losing a lot of business and in very quick, unmanaged amount of time.""
Shamie said his company will continue to supply products to Toys 'R' Us stores outside the United States, but that they are ‚Äúwatching closely.‚Äù
‚ÄúI have to create opportunity so I can continue to employ the people I employ,"" he said. 
In a dire landscape that claimed 17 retail bankruptcies and more than 8,000 U.S. store closures last year alone, vendors are wising up on their customers' financial health, paying close attention to online sales, new sources of revenue and, especially, liquidity.
Among those that could pick up toy market share: big-box retailers Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT); chains such as JC Penney Co Inc (N:JCP),  Kohls Corp  (N:KSS) and Bed Bath & Beyond (O:BBBY); drugstores like CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and  Rite Aid Corp  (N:RAD); and discount outlets like  Dollar General Corp  (N:DG) or TJ Maxx (N:TJX).
‚ÄúWe‚Äôll work really hard with folks like Walmart and Target to see if they can take up volume by year-end,‚Äù said Jay Foreman, chief executive of Basic Fun!, which sells Cake Pop Cuties and Poopeez as well as classics like Lite-Brite. 
Foreman expects a 10 percent revenue hit from the loss of Toys ‚ÄòR‚Äô Us.
He is also working with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), which will become its second- or third-biggest account this year versus ninth in 2015, but said Amazon does not give minimum orders.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôll put it online and say 'we‚Äôll see how it does.'‚Äù
Without mass distribution and a physical showcase, co-Chief Executive Nick Mowbray of toymaker¬†Zuru Inc said innovations would become far riskier, leaving a dent in toy selection for customers. 
""Doing business with a company in Chapter 11 was not supposed to be a 'gotcha' situation, but apparently in this case it was,"" said Learning Resources Inc Chief Executive Rick Woldenberg. His Vernon Hills, Illinois, company is owed more than $1 million by Toys 'R' Us. 

He said his company will no longer supply to Toys 'R' Us. ""I don't know how many times they think we can be punished.""

(Reuters) -  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) on Friday said its median employee last year made a little over half the $100,000 salary that Chairman Warren Buffett was awarded for running the conglomerate that made him the world's third-richest person.
In a regulatory filing, Berkshire said Buffett's salary, unchanged for more than a quarter century, was about 1.87 times the $53,510 median pay, based on a sample of about two-thirds of Berkshire's 377,000 employees across some 90 businesses such as Geico insurance, the BNSF railroad and Dairy Queen ice cream.
The 1.87 pay multiplier contrasts with the three-figure multipliers that some chiefs of big U.S. companies receive.
But nearly all of their fortunes, and those of Berkshire employees, are far smaller than Buffett's, whose $88.8 billion net worth trails only those of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) Chief Executive Jeff Bezos and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates, according to Forbes magazine.
Berkshire is working with Amazon and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) to develop a company that lowers healthcare costs. Gates is a Berkshire director and longtime friend of Buffett.
According to Friday's filing, Berkshire in 2017 also provided Buffett with $375,000 of home and personal security services, while Buffett, 87, reimbursed Berkshire $50,000 for personal expenses.
Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Manger, 94, drew his usual $100,000 salary in 2017, while Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg's pay rose 46 percent to $2.29 million, the filing said.
Pay was not disclosed for Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, the newly installed vice chairmen respectively overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance and insurance operations, but it will continue to be determined by Buffett.
Berkshire also recommended the rejection at its May 5 annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska of proposals by two shareholders.
Marcia Sage wants Berkshire to issue a report on its methane emissions, while Freeda Cathcart wants Berkshire to encourage more operating businesses to issue sustainability reports.
Berkshire called Sage's proposal imprudent, and said Cathcart's was ""inconsistent with Berkshire's culture"" of letting managers do their jobs without Buffett's interference.
Buffett controls 32 percent of Berkshire's voting power.

He also owns 17.2 percent of its stock, despite having donated more than $27.6 billion since 2006.

(Reuters) - Commercial real estate company  Brookfield Property Partners LP  (O:BPY) has submitted a new offer to take over GGP Inc (N:GGP), one of the largest owners and operators of U.S. shopping centers, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The new bid comes more than three months after a special board committee of GGP rejected a $14.8 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer from Brookfield Property, its largest shareholder, as inadequate.
Brookfield Property‚Äôs new offer has a slightly higher cash component and offers GGP shareholders a new security that will trade as a real estate investment trust, according to the sources.
GGP's special committee has not yet agreed to Brookfield Property's new offer, and negotiations are continuing, the sources said. 
The exact value of Brookfield Property's new bid could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Brookfield Property declined to comment, while GGP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Brookfield Property's efforts to buy GGP come as mall owners across the United States are struggling as many brick-and-mortar retailers lose business to e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
Brookfield Property unveiled a $23 per share cash-and-stock offer for the 66 percent stake of GGP it does not already own in November. A combination of Chicago-based GGP and Brookfield Property would create one of the world‚Äôs largest publicly traded property companies, giving it more power to negotiate prices with retailers.
The equity component of Brookfield's offer has emerged as a point of contention in the deal negotiations, the sources said, while recent U.S. tax reforms have also contributed to the talks being protracted.

It is not the first time Brookfield Property‚Äôs attempt to buy out a real estate investment trust in which it already owns a big stake has been rejected. In 2016, Rouse Properties Inc, another U.S. mall owner, rejected an offer by Brookfield Property, its largest shareholder, only to subsequently agree to a sweetened $2.8 billion offer.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 07:44PM ET</span>",Boeing moves to keep 777X on track after engine snag,"By Tim Hepher
SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) has scrambled to reorganize testing of its new 777X to avoid being delayed by engine snags, while robots and mechanics are starting work on the fuselage, the executive who heads efforts to build the world's largest twin-engined jet said in an interview.
Engine supplier  General Electric  (N:GE) began flight trials of its new GE9X jet engine on Tuesday after a three-month delay caused mainly by a problem in its compressor. But to put the engine development back on track it must build a new component.
During that time, Boeing will place two temporary engines on the first flight-test aircraft that is gradually beginning to take shape, starting with its lightweight carbon wings and now the fuselage, which Boeing says is on schedule.
The engines, identical in every other respect to the ones that will go into service, will be swapped for fresh ones with the new part before the first 777X carries out its maiden flight next year. The temporary engines will not be fired up, but having them in place will allow other tests to go ahead.
""Honestly, when this happened I thought 'this is going to be bad' and we just kept grinding and grinding at it, and we came up with some pretty creative things to test where we could, build where we could,"" 777X Vice President and General Manager Eric Lindblad told Reuters.
""To put engines on and then take them off - that is all to protect the schedule,"" Lindblad said.
The hurried rejig reflects the fact that after years of planning, production has begun in earnest - something evident from activity inside Boeing's new high-tech wing center.
""We are at the point where it is time to start scaling up the speed that we build things here,"" Lindblad said inside the 1.3 million-square-foot (120,800-square-meter) fabrication plant where machines weave and bake major parts of the carbon wings.
The engine swap is also an example of how Boeing is trying to avoid eating into the 'buffer' traditionally built into development schedules. That's because it faces a challenging two years before the latest version of its 777 enters service.
""We are now in the thick of it ... There is no more waiting until later to solve problems,"" Lindblad said. ""There are still two years left. You cannot give away your buffer."" 
The 777X aims to maintain Boeing's grip on the 'mini-jumbo' market by leapfrogging Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) 365-seat A350-1000. Boeing has sold over 300 jets, though activity has slowed.
'MORE OPTIMISTIC'
So far, Boeing says it is on track to meet a 2020 target for delivering the first 406-seat 777-9 model to Emirates Airline.
But although the engine snag marks the first significant public slippage, Boeing has already faced a number of teething problems in building carbon wings and other components.
""Everything is hard at this point where you start building an airplane. When you ask me how wing assembly has been going, it's been hard,"" Lindblad said.
One of the problems involves fitting the carbon panels to the skeleton of spars and ribs, with the light but strong carbon-fiber material less forgiving than traditional aluminum.
""Assuming we continue to march our way through the plan that we have laid out, I feel pretty optimistic about (the engine) and I think that wing assembly is a matter of incorporating the learnings,"" Lindblad said.
Six months ago, Lindblad says something else was making him feel ""queasy"". Integration of aircraft systems in a special demonstration lab was not happening as quickly as planned.
""I am more optimistic today,"" he said. He added that he would be ""cautiously guarded"" until the first flight, due in the first quarter of 2019.
Another headache has been producing enough wing stringers: reinforcing strips that go outwards from the fuselage.
""I feel confident we have got a plan for that so we are tracking basically back to schedule.""
Now Boeing must marry together the various wing parts and produce the long metallic fuselage.
Fuselage panels arriving from Japan have been loaded into a ""Fuselage Automated Upright Build"" (FAUB) machine used to fasten them. Boeing had delays when the machine was tried out on existing versions of the 777, but Boeing says the system is now running at full speed of five planes a month.
Drawing on experience of the smaller 737 MAX, which has absorbed production increases on a larger scale, Lindblad said the 777X production system had been set up to handle a targeted speed but would not disclose capacity.
""We are planning for world demand,"" he said.
The first task is to get flight trials under way so that ambitious fuel-saving goals can be tested.

""Will we get four airplanes in the flight test on schedule? We'll see. I think we have a pretty good shot at it.""

522,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 05:20PM ET</span>",Microsoft hits back at claims it ignored sexual harassment,"By Dan Levine and Salvador Rodriguez
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A senior executive said  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) thoroughly investigates issues raised by women in the workplace and fired about 20 employees last year over complaints of sexual harassment as the company seeks to counter claims that it treats female workers unfairly. 
In an email to employees publicly released late on Thursday, Microsoft Chief People Officer Kathleen Hogan said Microsoft had 83 harassment complaints in 2017 out of a U.S.-based workforce of over 65,000 employees. 
Nearly 50 percent were found to be supported at least in part following an investigation, she said, and more than half of those resulted in the termination of an employee who engaged in unacceptable behavior.
The unusual publication of such data comes as the world's largest software company is defending a lawsuit which alleges it systematically denied pay raises or promotions to women. Microsoft denies it has ever had such a policy. 
The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.
Microsoft also investigated 84 complaints of gender discrimination last year, Hogan said, and found around 10 percent of those to be supported at least in part.
Earlier this week, Reuters reported on the contents of unsealed court documents which showed that out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women in U.S.-based technical jobs at Microsoft between 2010 and 2016, only one was deemed ""founded"" by the company.
Attorneys for the women described the number of complaints as ""shocking"" in the court filings, and said the response by Microsoft's investigations team was ""lackluster.""
Hogan's email on Thursday linked to the Reuters story and said the numbers cited by plaintiffs were misleading. 
""Reports that we rarely reach a conclusion in favor of the complainant are based on a faulty reading of a partial data set,"" Hogan wrote.
Hogan's email did not provide additional figures about the time period cited in the court documents.
The plaintiffs based their numbers on documents disclosed by Microsoft during pre-trial discovery in the lawsuit. Kelly Dermody, an attorney for the plaintiffs, declined to comment on Hogan's email.
Alaina Percival, chief executive of Women Who Code, an organization that helps companies increase their number of women developers, said publicly releasing this kind of data can help businesses learn from each other about the best ways to handle sexual harassment and gender discrimination. 

""I think other tech companies should follow suit, and I would expect to see that happen,"" Percival said.

532,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 04:26PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com - Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week
1. US Stocks Nurse Weekly Loss Despite White House Attempts to Ease Trade War Fears 
Trading in U.S. stock markets this week was dominated by turmoil in Washington and rising fears over the prospect of a global trade war.
President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision to oust Rex Tillerson ‚Äì over a disagreement on the Iran deal ‚Äì drew widespread fear that the White House was dissolving into chaos as it was just a week ago that Gary Cohn resigned as President Donald Trump‚Äôs top economic advisor.
The turnover of top aides in Trump‚Äôs administration has made history ‚Äì So far, in the 14 months of his presidency, more than 20 senior administration staffers have either been fired, resigned or reassigned. White House chief of staff, John Kelly, was feared to be latest to resign from the Trump administration but after talks Thursday with Trump, the two reportedly reached a ‚Äútruce.‚Äù
Larry Kudlow ‚Äì Gary Cohn‚Äôs replacement as chief economic advisor ‚Äì did little to ease fears of a trade war, asserting that China ‚Äúhas earned a tough response not only from the United States‚Äù.
The White House, however, attempted to quell fears over a global trade war as it said Friday Trump was working with a number of counties over the possibility of providing exemptions on new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports.
The ebbs and flows of trade war angst were played out in Boeing (NYSE:BA) ‚Äì heavily reliant on China demand for its aircrafts ‚Äì as its share price suffered its worst week in two years.
The Dow ended the week nursing a loss despite closing more than 100 points higher on Friday.
2. WTI Crude Late Rally Delivered Weekly Win
Crude oil prices were on track for a weekly slump were it not for a late rally Friday. Some said the rally was on the back of rising geopolitical uncertainty which could lead to a disruption in global supplies amid reports Saudi Arabia is threatening to acquire nuclear weapons to counter the perceived Iranian threat.
That overshadowed investor fears of rising U.S. shale output which followed a trio of bearish reports from OPEC, the International Energy Agency and Energy Information Administration.
OPEC raised its growth forecast for non-OPEC production in 2018 by 280,000 barrels a day (bpd) to 1.66 million bpd this year, warning that non-OPEC supply growth, led by the U.S., will outstrip growth in global oil demand in 2018.
On Friday U.S. crude futures rose $1.16 to settle at $62.41 a barrel.
3. The Dollar Notched Weekly Win as Traders Eyed FOMC Rate Decision
The dollar notched a weekly win against a basket of major currencies as traders continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will raise its benchmark rate next week, March 21.
While many believe that the Federal Reserve‚Äôs March rate hike has been priced in, the central‚Äôs bank‚Äôs rate-hike projections or so-called dot-plots ‚Äì illustrating where individual FOMC members believe rates are heading ‚Äì are expected to be shifted upward, pointing to a faster pace of rate hikes.
TD Securities said it expects Fed officials to sound more upbeat at the March FOMC meeting with the ‚Äúbalance of risks now skewed to the upside.‚Äù
According to Investing.com‚Äôs Fed rate monitor, traders see a 93% chance the Federal Reserve will hike rates by 0.25% to a range of 1.50% to 1.75%.
4. Gold‚Äôs Glitter in Fed‚Äôs Pocket
Gold prices ended week nursing heavy loss as traders appeared reluctant to purchase the precious metal ahead of Federal Reserve‚Äôs widely expected interest rate hike next week.
The yellow metal‚Äôs brief forays higher on safe-haven demand amid Washington turmoil and trade war angst were used as selling opportunities. Data on Friday confirmed the negative turn in sentiment on gold prices as traders slashed their bullish bets on gold by the most in six weeks.
CFTC COT data showed money managers reduced their net long positions in gold futures to 167,900 lots from 183,800 lots for the week ended March 16.
5. Bitcoin: Bears in Control
Bitcoin added to losses sustained in the previous week despite rebounding from a slump below $8,000 Friday as regulators and private companies continued to stifle cryptocurrency activity.
Google become the latest company to introduce measures aimed at curbing cryptocurrency activity as the search-engine giant said it would ban crypto-related ad content. Facebook adopted a similar measure in January.
This comes a month after major banks across the US and UK halted cryptocurrency purchases on credit, striking a better blow to investors, who use credit cards to fund their cryptocurrency investment. This usually involves exchanging some form of fiat currency ‚Äì currency that a government has declared to be legal tender ‚Äì for a funding digital currency like Bitcoin or Ethereum.
On the regulatory front, meanwhile, IMF chief Christine Lagarde called for a crackdown on bitcoin, insisting the same technology that powered cryptocurrencies could be used to help regulate them.
Bitcoin fell 6% over the past seven days, hitting a low of $7,666.3, while Ripple XRP fell 15.85% over the same period, hitting a low of $0.62800 on the poloniex exchange.
Ethereum fell under $600 for the first time since February 6 before rebounding but was set to end the week down 13%"

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lower tax rates for U.S. retailers drove a rally in shares for the sector that has largely fizzled out, but investors see buying opportunities among retailers they believe can thrive despite the growing exodus of consumers to online shopping.
Shares of brick-and-mortar retailers in the S&P Composite 1500 Retailing index <.SPCOMMS> surged 23 percent as a group from November, when the Trump administration's tax overhaul began to pick up steam in Congress, to January, when the S&P 500 (SPX) hit its peak. That was more than double the 9.5 percent gain for the S&P 500.
But retail stocks lost ground in February as they reported quarterly results, even though fourth-quarter earnings for nearly 70 percent of retailers beat average analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The group of store-dependent retailers within the S&P 1500 Retailing index has lost 3.8 percent so far in 2018, while the S&P 500 is up 2.8 percent year to date.
U.S. retail sales have fallen for three straight months. 
""Some issues are coming back into focus for traditional retail,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston.
Still, some investors see buying opportunities with retailers they believe can thrive even as more shoppers migrate to Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and other online retailers.
""As brick-and-mortar retail gets displaced more gradually over time, we're looking more to specialty retail,"" said Mona Mahajan, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors in New York.
Declines in retail stocks suggest investors had already priced in benefits from the tax overhaul, analysts said. Investors shunned companies that said they would reinvest tax savings rather than let them flow to earnings, said Simeon Siegel, an analyst at Nomura Instinet.
For instance, shares of Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (N:LB), which announced $100 million in wage and benefit increases for its workers, dropped 13.9 percent the day after it reported quarterly results. 
However, the S&P 1500 Department Stores index <.SPCOMRETD> has risen 11.8 percent since the beginning of the year.
Last year, shares of department stores slumped 14.1 percent from 2016 levels, as investors viewed them as on the edge of obsolescence. But since then, they have streamlined their inventory and reduced their number of locations.
""The stocks got overly cheap,"" said Bridget Weishaar, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. ""They were almost priced as if the sector was going to die. That's not going to happen."" 
Companies with strong brands such as  Michael Kors Holdings  Ltd (N:KORS) and PVH Corp (N:PVH), the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, are better positioned for upside, said Allianz's Mahajan.
Oliver Pursche, vice chairman and chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York, favors stores such as Tiffany & Co (N:TIF), which he said will benefit from the overall strength of U.S. stocks as upper-middle-income shoppers gain confidence in their financial standing.
""They see their 401(k)s and other investments doing well, and they're apt to go out and spend extra,"" he said. 
""It's viewed as high-end, but there are a lot of reasonably priced goods at a Tiffany's. It's not like Van Cleef and Arpels, where you can't walk out without spending $15,000.""
Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York, believes consumer discretionaries have diminished pricing power in the wake of Amazon's ascent, yet he said Walmart Inc (N:WMT) may be an exception. The big-box retailer has fallen 15.1 percent since it reported quarterly results on Feb. 20, mainly because inventory issues caused its online sales to fall.

""The decline in the stock is driven by very short-term factors,"" Ghriskey said. ""We think that Walmart can be a strong number two, a reasonable number two to Amazon in the general online world.""

539,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 03:01PM ET</span>",Kering says Swiss activities tax-compliant,"PARIS (Reuters) - French luxury goods group  Kering  (PA:PRTP) has complied with its tax obligations in Switzerland, it said on Friday, responding to newspaper reports alleging that the company used a Swiss-based scheme to evade taxes on earnings from brands such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. 
France's Mediapart and Germany's Der Spiegel alleged that Kering had saved on taxes it should have paid in countries such as Italy by billing some business carried out elsewhere to a Swiss site. 
Mediapart, which cited documents linked to an Italian tax investigation, said it estimated that since 2002 Kering had saved 2.5 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in tax in this manner. 
The newspapers said that wholesale activities -- the sale of products to retailers such as department stores -- are largely carried out by Kering staff in cities such as Paris, Milan or London but that the group benefited from a low tax rate of about 8 percent by billing them through the Swiss region of Ticino. 
Kering said that its Swiss businesses, home to more than 600 employees, were an important part of its inventory management, billing and supply chain logistics and that their activities were directly linked to its brands. Kering said that all of its companies there carried out tangible business activities
""The group pays its due taxes in Switzerland, in compliance with the law and the fiscal status of the company. This business operating model is known by French and other competent tax authorities,"" Kering said in a statement sent to Reuters. 
The bulk of the allegations are centered on Italian fashion brand Gucci, which is subject to a tax investigation by prosecutors in Milan. Police raided Gucci offices in Milan and Florence late last year. [nL8N1O20DQ]
Kering has said it is collaborating with that investigation.
The group run by French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, scion of Kering's founding family, said in February that it had yet to set aside funds linked to the investigation. 
""The related tax risk cannot be measured reliably at this point in the proceedings and therefore no specific provision was recorded in 2017,"" it said in its last annual report.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - The smallest member of Boeing Co's (N:BA) upgraded narrowbody jetliner range, the 138-seat 737 MAX 7, began a maiden flight on Friday, the start of several months of trials before entering service next year, the company said.
The shortened 737, designed for hot and high conditions or longer journeys than larger narrowbody jets, took off in sunny weather near Seattle at 10:17 a.m. (1717 GMT), watched by Boeing workers and media. The plane was expected to fly for about three hours over Washington state.
The aircraft is the third and smallest member of Boeing's 737 MAX line-up, but has posted relatively modest sales with fewer than 100 estimated orders out of 4,000 for the MAX family.
Even before taking to the skies, the 737 MAX 7 was thrust into an international dispute when Boeing argued its future was being placed at risk by aggressive discounting by Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb), straining U.S.-Canadian trade relations.
A U.S. trade tribunal in January overturned steep duties imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department on the Bombardier CSeries, saying Boeing had not been harmed by CSeries prices.
Most analysts say demand for such jets, including the competing Airbus SE (PA:AIR) A319neo, is limited as airlines tend to switch to higher-capacity versions to keep up with demand.
""I want to put a yet on that,"" Boeing product marketing regional director Jeff Haber said when asked why the aircraft had not sold as well as larger models.
There are about 2,500 aircraft of its size flying that will need to be replaced in future, Haber said.
""We see a significant market in Asia ... and South America,"" he said.
Boeing, which does not break down 737 MAX sales by variant, declined to say how many MAX 7s it had sold but said it had eight customers including Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and Westjet Airlines Ltd (TO:WJA).
The company is increasing narrowbody production to meet record overall demand for the 737, which last week celebrated its 10,000th aircraft since the 1968 debut of its now largely upgraded design.

It faces another milestone when the first 737 MAX 9 is delivered to its first customer next week.

Canada has submitted the request for a meeting of the WTO's dispute settlement body on March 27, according to an agenda circulated by the WTO on Friday. 
Ottawa launched the complaint in November, saying it would forcefully defend its lumber industry against punitive U.S. tariffs, which it said were ""unfair, unwarranted and deeply troubling"".
It had already started a challenge under the North American Free Trade Agreement's Chapter 19 dispute settlement mechanism, which the United States wants to remove as part of talks to modernize the regional trade pact the two countries share with Mexico.
The U.S. Commerce Department accuses Canada of unfairly subsidizing and dumping softwood lumber, which is commonly used in the construction of homes. It has said its duties affect about $5.66 billion worth of imports.
The disagreement centers on the fees paid by Canadian lumber mills for timber cut largely from government-owned land. They are lower than fees paid on U.S. timber, which comes largely from private land.

The United States imposed the tariffs after the failure of talks to resolve the decades-long dispute over the lumber trade.

LONDON (Reuters) - Financial markets have been shaken this quarter by a raft of worries: the prospect of a global trade war, turmoil in the Trump Administration, signals by central banks of a shift towards monetary tightening and tensions between world powers. 
These factors have weighed on sentiment following a burst of market volatility in February that wiped trillions of dollars from world stocks from which investors are yet to recover fully. 
Here are 10 charts to watch for warning signs of increasing market turmoil, stress in the banking system and investor flight to safety:
U.S. YIELD CURVE
The gap between 10-year (US10YT=RR) and 2-year US Treasury yields (US2YT=RR). A 'flattening' curve is often considered a portent of slowing economic activity, an 'inverted' curve has been a reliable predictor of recession. The curve hit its flattest in a decade in January and has flattened further in recent days on demand for safe-haven, long-dated Treasuries.
(Graphic: U.S. yield curve - http://reut.rs/2HEPZlY)
DOLLAR/YEN
The Japanese yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar. In times of market stress or financial stress, the yen often strengthens, pushing dollar/yen lower. Earlier this month, dollar/yen hit its lowest level since November 2016. 
(For a graphic of the Dollar vs yen click http://reut.rs/2HFkrg2)
VIX
The benchmark measure of U.S. stock market volatility, sometimes referred to as Wall Street's ""fear gauge"". Having posted its biggest one-day spike ever on February 5, the VIX (VIX) has since come down but investors don't see it revisiting the record lows of only a few months ago. 
(Graphic: Volatility - http://reut.rs/2FFf4AH)
LIBOR/OIS SPREAD
The gap between short-term U.S. interbank lending rates  and overnight money market rates , reflecting perceived stress in the banking system and the corporate world. The gap widened to 52 basis points this week, a level not seen since January 2012. At the end of 2017, it was 27 basis points.

FINANCIALS CDS
An index of credit default swaps in the European financial sector, the cost of insuring against default on ""junior"" bank debt and effectively a measure of counterparty risk and stress in the banking system.
(Graphic: Financial CDS - http://reut.rs/2FIsPi7)
INVESTOR DEMAND FOR CASH
A measure of cash holdings in U.S. retail investors‚Äô portfolios, according to the American Association of Individual Investors monthly asset allocation surveys. High cash balances reflect investors‚Äô preference for safety over risk.

GLOBAL HIGH YIELD BONDS
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill Lynch's global index of high-yield bonds <.MERHW00>, reflecting credit risk in the so-called ""junk"" market, a sector that will attract huge inflows of cash in good times but often one of the first sectors investors will flee from in bad.

ITRAXX CROSSOVER
An index of sub-investment grade ‚Äì or ""junk"" rated - European credit default swaps, effectively a measure of investors‚Äô perception of credit risk and corporate borrowing costs.
(Graphic: iTraxx Crossover Index - http://reut.rs/2FIZaVW)
ST. LOUIS FED FINANCIAL STRESS INDEX
The St. Louis Fed Financial Stress index  measures the degree of financial stress in the markets. According to the St. Louis Fed, the average value of the index since its inception in 1993 is designed to be zero. Thus, zero is viewed as representing normal financial market conditions. Values below zero suggest below-average financial market stress, while values above zero suggest above-average financial market stress. Although still below zero, the index has risen considerably this year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Paulson & Co, the hedge fund firm led by billionaire investor John Paulson, has laid off at least four senior executives, according to a person familiar with the situation. 
The departures on Thursday, according to the source who requested anonymity because the information is private, include top traders Keith Hannan and Brad Rosenberg, and partners Victor Flores, who focused on gold investments, and Allen Puwalski, a financial company expert.
‚ÄúWe are rightsizing the firm to focus on our core expertise in areas that are growing,"" a Paulson spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. 
Hannan, Rosenberg, Flores and Puwalski did not respond to emails seeking comment. 
Paulson manages about $9 billion today, down tens of billions of dollars from its peak around 2011, according to the source.
The firm employs about 95 people. Bloomberg reported in February that Paulson planned to downsize its Manhattan offices by moving to a smaller space in the offices of firm-owned Steinway Musical Instruments Inc.
A fund that uses Paulson's core strategy, Schroder GAIA Paulson Merger Arbitrage, is down 5.6 percent this year through March 6, according to a report by HSBC. The fund also fell in each of the last four calendar years.
Other Paulson funds focused on European stocks, credit and another merger-related strategy, Pure Spread, are up this year, building on gains in 2017, the person said. 
News of the layoffs was previously reported by The New York Post and Business Insider.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Outsized returns delivered by Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Netflix (O:NFLX) and other heavyweight technology stocks have made them heroes on Wall Street, but some strategists warn that investors' reliance on them exacerbates the risk of a steep downturn. 
Amazon's 35 percent surge in 2018 has pushed its market capitalization up to $770 billion, equivalent to 3 percent of the S&P 500 and close behind Apple's nearly 4 percent share of the index. 
Apple (O:AAPL), Facebook (O:FB), Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet (O:GOOGL) have grown their collective market value by more than 40 percent in the past year to $3 trillion, and they now account for a quarter of the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC).
(For a graphic on how FANG + Apple now accounts for a quarter of the Nasdaq click http://reut.rs/2FEUeSf)
Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade,"" a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes.
""It's a big momentum trade, investors don't care if they're paying 15 or 20 or even 50 times earnings,"" said Mike O'Rourke, Chief Market Strategist at JonesTrading. ""The problem is, once those names start giving up those gains, then the market starts to have problems.""
Investors have been attracted to those stocks for good reason: Amazon's revenue ballooned 31 percent to $178 billion last year, while Netflix is expected by analysts on average to more than double its net income to $1.2 billion in 2018. 
An expected interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday may not have a strong effect on technology companies, which generally rely less than other kinds of companies on debt. 
The S&P 500 information technology index (SPLRCT) dipped by an average of 0.3 percent in the five-session period following the Fed's four most recent rate hikes, in line with S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters data. 
Investors nervous about how much longer a nine-year bull market can last have favored big tech names as among the most reliable on the stock market because their business models are often viewed as disruptive and less susceptible to economic downturns, at least over the long run. 
The popularity of Amazon, which is pushing beyond online retail and cloud computing into supermarkets and even healthcare, has left it trading at 167 times expected earnings, up from around 100 a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. By comparison, the S&P 500 is trading at about 17 times expected earnings.
""If you ask anyone right now, if it's a business owner they'll say they're afraid of Amazon. If they're an investor, they'll tell you Amazon is going up forever,"" said Andrew Bodner, president of Double Diamond Investment Group in Parsippany, New Jersey. 
""Overall, it creates more volatility for the market because everyone owns Amazon, and if Amazon goes down you'll see that reflected,"" Bodner said.
Investors' increased reliance on passively managed index funds has also contributed to the rally in technology shares because the companies' inclusion in the S&P 500 and other indexes means money will be poured into them even if they have expensive earnings multiples, O'Rourke said. 
Momentum for some major technology stocks is already showing signs of moderation. Facebook has fallen 5 percent after hitting a record high at the start of February, with some investors worried that people are spending less time on the social media platform. 
Posing a potential threat to the rally, the S&P 500 technology index is trading at a relatively expensive 18.8 times expected earnings, 12 percent above its 15-year average, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. 
(Graphic: Tech earnings multiples far above average - http://reut.rs/2FL29JL)
While S&P 500 information technology earnings per share are expected to grow by a healthy 17.5 percent this year, that's less than last year's 20.8 percent surge and lower than the 19.5 percent earnings expansion expected for the entire S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Technology companies may be benefiting more modestly than others from corporate tax cuts enacted this year, according to CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell. 
Even as the S&P 500 wavered over worries that President Donald Trump might spark a trade war, the Nasdaq on Monday closed at a record high, more than bouncing back from a deep selloff across Wall Street only a month ago. 

""People are going with what works, and if tech was working before the shakeout in February, then they're going to stay in it,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

583,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 04:14PM ET</span>",Caterpillar's latest restructuring move could cut 880 jobs,"By Rajesh Kumar Singh
CHICAGO (Reuters) -  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT) will close two facilities in Texas and Panama and is also considering shutting its engine manufacturing plant in Illinois as part of a strategy to boost profitability and better handle business cycles, but the move could cut 880 jobs. 
The plant closures, which were announced internally over the past two months, were confirmed to Reuters by a company spokeswoman on Friday. 
She said the move will affect its work tools facility in Waco, Texas, and its demonstration center in Panama.
The world's largest heavy-duty equipment maker emerged last year from the longest downturn in its history, when sales dropped more than 40 percent between 2012 and 2016.
The struggle led not only to a leadership change, but also resulted in a credit rating downgrade by Moody's. 
Chastised by the sales slump, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company has embarked upon a restructuring strategy, looking to squeeze more production out of its existing factories, focusing on lean manufacturing, margin expansion and asset efficiency.
Separately, Caterpillar's Progress Rail unit is contemplating the closure of its engine manufacturing facility in LaGrange, Illinois, shifting the work to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and outside suppliers.
""If the LaGrange decision is finalized, the closure would impact approximately 600 full-time positions related directly to engine manufacturing,"" Caterpillar's spokeswoman said.
The plant closure news comes as some U.S. manufacturers are grappling with President Donald Trump's decision to impose import duties on steel and aluminum imports, which is expected to inflate input costs for equipment makers like Caterpillar.
The company's shares were up 1.6 percent at $156.99 on Friday afternoon.
COST CUTS
Since 2013, Caterpillar has reduced its construction and energy and transportation assets by more than $4 billion.
The full-time workforce is smaller too. Even as a recovery in key markets is driving up production at its factories, Caterpillar is relying more on workers with flexible contracts to cater to the improving demand.
Caterpillar had 116,700 workers globally - including both fulltime and those with flexible contracts - at the end of last year.
Instead of investing in new factories, the company is spending money on expanding its services business and enhancing e-commerce capabilities.
The plan aims to eventually lift Caterpillar's adjusted operating margin to 14-17 percent when annual sales reach $55 billion. The company had sales of $45.5 billion in 2017.
Judging from recent results, the plan seems to be working. The adjusted operating margin swelled to nearly 14 percent last year, its highest level in at least 10 years, from 7 percent in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.
PLAYBOOK
In its focus on operating discipline, Caterpillar's restructuring program is similar to the strategy Deere & Co (N:DE) has pursued for nearly two decades as it seeks to boost returns for shareholders.
That discipline has stood the Moline, Illinois-based company in good stead, helping it sustain returns on capital and investment through varying economic cycles.
Caterpillar's director of investor relations, Amy Campbell, said earlier this week that the company would continue to look at structural costs reduction despite an improvement in sales volumes.
Caterpillar's workers were informed of the plans about the LaGrange and Panama facilities in January. The decision on the Waco facility was announced in late February.
The work at the Texas plant will be shifted to Wamego, Kansas, affecting 200 regular and contract positions, and the closure of the Panama facility will eliminate about 80 positions, the spokeswoman said.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 11:47AM ET</span>","After pay vote, Disney investors question Iger's rich deal","By Ross Kerber
BOSTON (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Iger stands to earn up to $423 million over four years, according to a new analysis of a compensation package rejected by shareholders, and some investors want to raise the bar on his performance targets.
Disney suffered a rare rebuke from its shareholders last week when a 52 percent majority opposed the compensation of Iger and other executives in a non-binding vote that could encourage the board to tweak the pay package. 
ISS Analytics, the data arm of proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, estimated that if Iger hits maximum goals the package would make him the 12th-highest paid U.S. CEO on an annual basis in the past 10 years.
Disney did not put a total value on Iger's pay package. 
Markus Hansen, senior research analyst at Vontobel Asset Management, which had 2.4 million Disney shares at year-end, praised Iger's performance but said the firm voted against the compensation with the view the four-year pay package could be too easy to collect. 
Under a contract extension through 2021 Iger could receive the full value of $100 million in stock awards tied to a deal to buy film and television assets from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (O:FOXA) even if Disney's total shareholder returns are middle-of-the-pack versus other big companies.
While the metrics are not unusual, the feedback the board should take from the shareholder vote is that ""the amount is large, so maybe a reduction in the amount and an increase in the performance targets"" would be in order, Hansen said.
Jacob Williams, corporate governance manager for pension overseer Florida State Board of Administration, said it voted its 2.2 million Disney shares against the compensation on similar concerns. It also had concerns about the lack of a clear succession plan after Iger leaves.
""You hate to see a payout of that magnitude for short-term performance,"" Williams said. He said however that a reorganization Disney announced on Wednesday had assuaged some succession concerns.
To be sure, some investors would be pleased if Iger earned the top number. Ross Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, said he voted 150,000 shares for Disney's compensation plan because other media companies also pay well and Iger's Fox deal looks smart.
""If he succeeds, then you pay the guy,"" Gerber said.
Compensation consultant Brent Longnecker said the vote could spur the board to re-examine Iger's performance goals, though he did not expect major change. 
""I assume they won't ignore it,"" Longnecker said of the vote.
Asked about the pay estimate and investor concerns, a Disney spokesman referred to comments after the vote from Aylwin Lewis, chair of the company's compensation committee. 
Lewis had said the board will take the vote result under advisement for future CEO compensation. Iger is ""imperative"" for Disney to keep as it absorbs Fox, Lewis said, with the CEO's value illustrated by a total shareholder return of 414 percent during his tenure. Iger became CEO in 2005. 
Iger made $36.3 million in the twelve months ended Sept. 30. 
The analysis by ISS Analytics done at the request of Reuters showed the agreement could yield Iger roughly $423 million over four years if he hits all goals, or $274 million as the base case targeted by the board. 
The analysis assumed that the Fox deal closes early next year and excluded elements such as stock appreciation. After the deal closes, Iger's target annual pay would be about $55 million per year including salary and some stock awards.

That amount could rise based on performance goals, ISS found.

The news came as the company filed a request to exempt some of its foreign-made panels from the new 30 percent tariffs.
In the filing, SunPower argued that its highly efficient, premium-priced solar panels cannot be compared with the more conventional models that dominate the market.
In an interview, Chief Executive Tom Werner said it was not seeking an exemption for its less efficient and expensive ""P-series"" panels and would likely set up a new U.S. manufacturing plant for that product.

An exclusion of its other products from the tariffs ""just makes it far easier to make that investment,"" Werner said.

That gulf in pay comes close to the 59 percent gap revealed on Thursday by HSBC (L:HSBA) - the biggest yet reported by a British financial firm according to government data.
Thousands of large UK employers have been ordered to disclose their gender pay gaps by April, almost 50 years on from the passage of Britain's equal pay act.
Goldman Sachs said its gap reflected the fact that there were more men than women in senior positions at the firm. 
It also reported a mean gender pay gap of 16.1 percent and a mean bonus gap of 32.5 percent in Goldman Sachs (UK) SVC Limited, which it said employs around 1,600 individuals from non-revenue divisions. 
The bank employs 6,000 people in London. The remainder of its UK employees work in its international business. 
Other large banks have also been disclosing their gender pay gaps ahead of the April deadline set last year by Prime Minister Theresa May.
The continued gulf in earnings between men and women has attracted significant public attention over the past year or so. 
The gender pay gap measures the difference between the average salary of men and women, calculated on an hourly basis. 
In Goldman Sachs' international business, 83 percent of the group earning the highest hourly pay were men, the bank said, while 62.4 percent of those on the lowest hourly pay were women. 
This compared with 77.4 percent men in the highest paid group in Goldman Sachs (UK) SVC Limited, and 48.9 percent women in the lowest paid group. 

The Wall Street bank said it is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion at all levels of the firm. On Thursday, it said it wanted women to make up half of its global workforce, starting with a target of 50 percent of its new analysts being women by 2021.

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) said on Friday it was offered about $2.1 billion for its LifeScan Inc unit, which makes blood glucose monitoring products, by private equity firm Platinum Equity, another step towards exiting the diabetes device market.
Platinum has given J&J until mid-June to accept the offer to allow for consultations with overseas workers.
Sales at J&J's diabetes device business, which also includes Animas Corp and Calibra Medical Inc, have been falling since 2012 in a highly competitive market and the company said last January that it was evaluating options for the units.
J&J said in October it would shut down Animas, which makes insulin pumps, after failing to find a buyer. J&J spokeswoman Donna Lorenson said the strategic review of the Calibra division, which sells wearable insulin pumps, is ongoing. 
LifeScan, which has headquarters in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania, and Zug, Switzerland, sells personal blood glucose meters, testing strips, and testing systems. More than 20 million people in 90 countries use its products.
Platinum Equity said in a press release that it is currently consulting with works councils that represent employees. The offer could be finalized by mid-June, unless it is extended, and a deal is anticipated to close by the end of 2018. 
The company has 2,400 employees, largely in Europe, China and the United States, Lorenson said.
ANALYSTS SAY PRICE OK
The price for LifeScan, which generated revenue of about $1.5 billion in 2017, was disappointing but fair since the unit had weighed on J&J's growth for some time, Atlantic Equities analyst Steve Chesney said.
""Obviously expectations were for a higher valuation based on earlier reports, but probably closer to reality given the state of the business,"" Chesney said. 
Reuters had reported in January that Chinese buyers were interested in paying $3 billion to $4 billion for the companies.
Cowen analyst Joshua Jennings said in a research note that the LifeScan valuation was reasonable given that the business was declining and facing continued pricing pressure.
J&J said it factored the transaction into the 2018 earnings forecast it gave in January.

J&J shares fell 0.4 percent, or 56 cents, to $132.50 in morning trading.

LONDON (Reuters) - Appetite for equities came back with a vengeance this week, driving record inflows as concerns around trade dissipated and billions more were plowed into tech stocks, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Merrill-Lynch strategists said on Friday.
Alongside the resurgence of a ""wall of money"" going into stocks, BAML however noted that equities are not yielding as much as these flows would suggest. 
Signs of peaking credit markets and the rising inter-bank borrowing rate could be ""cracks"" in the wall, strategists added. 
ONE STEP BACK, TWO STEPS FORWARD
A record $43.3 billion was driven into equities this week as investors shrugged off trade risks that had initially sent stocks reeling, figures from flows tracker EPFR cited by BAML indicated.
U.S. large-cap funds, which lost $10.1 billion last week, drew in more than double that amount this week, enjoying their fourth highest ever inflows at $22 billion. 
Equity inflows are outpacing bond inflows for the first time since 2013, with annualized flows of $717 billion. Bond funds managed relatively minute inflows of $2.4 billion this week. 
""Flows indicate clients positioned for higher EPS [earnings per share], higher short rates, higher bond yields, lower U.S. dollar,"" wrote the strategists.
Massive flows into tech stocks have created a towering pile of cash in the sector dubbed ""Silicon mountain"" by BAML strategists. 
A record $2.6 billion went into tech stocks this week, cementing the sector's leading position. Investors have plowed a total of $9.8 billion into tech funds so far this year - making the annualized flow figure a massive $46.5 billion.
Financials drew in $1.6 billion, and are the second most popular sector after tech, having enjoyed $7.3 billion of inflows year-to-date.
European stocks saw modest outflows of $1.3 billion, meanwhile. Emerging market equities continued to draw in cash ($2.7 billion) and Japanese equity funds enjoyed their 15th straight week of inflows as the popularity of the asset class proved resilient.
But large inflows are out of step with more muted returns from equities. 
""Chart-topping inflows not coinciding with headline returns,"" the strategists said, pointing to the NYSE composite index (NYA), which is down year-to-date. All major European stock indices are still in the red since the start of 2018, while the S&P 500 is only slightly up.
TEPID RETURNS, CREDIT OUTFLOWS KEEP LID ON SENTIMENT
Despite torrential inflows into stocks, BAML's Bull & Bear index of investor sentiment fell from 6.8 to 6.5 on the more muted equity returns, and as outflows from emerging market debt and high-yield corporate bonds increased.
What BAML calls ""cracks"" in the wall of money include signs the credit market is peaking, and a rising inter-bank borrowing rate.
High-yield corporate bond fund flows reached a ""clear negative inflection point"", strategists said, noting the ninth straight week of outflows from high-yield bond funds - their longest losing streak since 2007. 
Investors pulled $0.7 billion from emerging market debt funds. 
Strategists said inflows and returns for investment grade, high yield and EM debt funds are peaking, which could be a harbinger of lower equity returns. 
Treasuries funds drew in $0.3 billion in their eighth straight week of inflows. ""Treasuries and bunds hinting at 'growth scare' makes stocks vulnerable,"" the strategists wrote. 
The increasing inter-bank borrowing rate (LIBOR) was likely to lead to tighter financial conditions, they added. Short-term borrowing costs have surged in the past weeks to levels last seen in the 2008 global financial crisis. [nL2N1QH1N5]
A rise in the U.S. dollar could also hobble the rally in tech and emerging market stocks. 
Passive investment vehicles reasserted their dominance this week as the vast majority of investors used exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to plow money back into stocks. 
A record $43.9 billion was driven into equity ETFs while mutual funds suffered $0.6 billion of outflows. Actively managed funds had managed to claw back some inflows in the past few weeks.

LONDON (Reuters) - The risk of disrupted insurance and derivatives contracts for customers is ""material"" unless Britain and the European Union take joint action ahead of Brexit, the Bank of England said on Friday.
Britain has made progress towards mitigating risks of disruption to financial services after it leaves the bloc next March, the BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said in a statement on Friday on its March 12 meeting.
""Nonetheless, material risks remain, particularly in areas where actions would be needed by both the UK and EU authorities,"" the FPC said.
Britain and the EU aim to agree a Brexit transition deal next week to avoid a disorderly exit in 2019, but further steps were needed to ensure ""continuity"" of financial contracts.
Britain has signaled it will adopt legislation, but so far the EU has not reciprocated.
Financial industry officials say the EU may not act until the last minute in order to put maximum pressure on banks and insurers based in Britain to open new hubs in the bloc ahead of Brexit.
Without action, insurers in Britain and the EU may not be able to pay claims on policies or receive premiums.
There is particular concern over uncleared derivatives contracts worth a notional 26 trillion pounds, which need a temporary permissions regime to service them.
""EU authorities have not announced their intention to grant such permissions,"" the FPC said.
Robert Ophele, chair of France's markets watchdog, said on Thursday that public authorities should provide adequate legal support for continuity of contracts, possibly through provisions in Britain's withdrawal agreement with the EU.
But ratification of that agreement is not expected until October or later, though a transition deal this month could allow regulators to begin talks.
The European Commision has been approached by Reuters for comment on the matter.
JUNE CAPITAL REVIEW
The FPC said Britain's banking system could continue to support the economy if there was a disorderly departure from the EU, and that current Brexit risks don't require banks to hold more capital.
It sent a warning to banks, however.
The committee will review in June whether the current 1 percent counter-cyclical capital buffer should be raised due to other risks, such as more home loans are being granted at high loan-to-income ratios that bump up against the BoE's ceiling.
The FPC decided that this year's stress test for the main banks and building societies should be the same as for 2017, which was more severe than the 2007-09 global financial crisis.
The test will take into account preparations for Brexit and the introduction of ring-fencing of retail banking arms with bespoke cushions of capital in January 2019.
This year's test will also reflect a new accounting rule that forces banks to provision earlier for souring loans.

Systemic banks, such as HSBC and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) will face a higher test hurdle than last year, somewhere above 8 percent of risk-weighted asset, compared with just below that level in 2017. Missing the hurdle will mean aggressive, rapid action would be needed to bolster capital buffers.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Shares in  Siemens  Healthineers (DE:SHLG) gained as much as 7 percent in the medical equipment maker's stock market debut on Friday, boding well for a string of pending German flotations including asset manager DWS.
In one of Germany's biggest listing in recent years, parent Siemens (DE:SIEGn) raised 4.2 billion euros from selling a 15 percent stake in the world's largest maker of medical imaging equipment.
Issued at 28 euros apiece, the shares opened at 29.10 euros after a delay of more than an hour because of market-wide technical problems at Deutsche Boerse's (DE:DB1Gn) electronic trading platform. By 1157 GMT the shares were up by 7.1 percent at 29.98 euros, outpacing a 0.3 percent gain for the benchmark DAX (GDAXI) index.
Deutsche Boerse said it would take two to three days to investigate the technical problems but ruled out a hacking attack.
The offer price, which valued Healthineers' equity at 28 billion euros, was seen by some market participants as a climbdown by Siemens to stoke interest in the issue. 
Healthineers had been touted at between 26 billion euros and 31 billion euros, below initial expectations of up to 40 billion euros. 
Investors have cited uncertain prospects for Healthineers' flagship Atellica blood and urine diagnostics machines. It is also seen facing slightly more volatile markets, which have pulled valuations off record highs.
Several large German listings are in the pipeline, with Deutsche Bank's (DE:DBKGn) asset-management arm DWS due to float next week. Publisher SpringerNature, property company Godewind, home-shopping group HSE24, fashion retailer Takko and online furniture retailer Home24 are all expected to follow suit.
EXTERNAL INVESTMENT
The Healthineers IPO, which investors have hailed as a pure-play medical technology investment, is among the biggest German listings since the start of the millennium.  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) and Infineon (DE:IFXGn) are top of the pile, both topping 6 billion euros when they listed in 2000, with Innogy's (DE:IGY) 2016 flotation raising 4.6 billion euros. 
For parent Siemens, Healthineers' market debut marks a key step in the group's drive to attract external investors for businesses outside its core industrial engineering and automation operations. 
It completed a merger of its wind power business with  Gamesa  (MC:SGREN) in April last year and agreed to create a joint venture with France's  Alstom  (PA:ALSO) for its rail operations.
Siemens wants Healthineers to be able to raise its own funds for takeovers and investments as well as crystallize its standalone value, removing some of the ""conglomerate discount"" that some investors say weighs on Siemens' valuation.
Healthineers' management has promised growth from its Atellica platform by catching up quickly with established diagnostics competitors, but Sebastien Buch of fund manager Union Investment -- a top 10 Siemens shareholder, which is buying into the IPO -- voiced some doubts. 
""A discount is warranted as investors are skeptical about how successful the rollout will be,"" Buch told Reuters this week. ""The preceding five Siemens diagnostics platforms continually lost market share over the last couple of years.""
Healthineers is on track to join Germany's mid-cap index (MDAXI) in June via a fast-track entry mechanism ahead of the normal assessment date.
""With its expected free float market cap of about 4.2 billion euros, Healthineers currently ranks 18th and clearly exceeds the 1.9 billion needed for fast-entry inclusion,"" said Silke Schluensen, index specialist at brokerage Oddo Seydler.

611,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 08:52AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank boosts bonuses to 2.3 billion euros despite bigger 2017 loss,"By Tom Sims
FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) paid bonuses worth 2.3 billion euros ($2.83 billion) for 2017, four times higher than the previous year even as the German lender warned on costs for 2018 and reported a bigger 2017 loss than previously disclosed.
Germany's flagship lender said on Friday that its top 12 managers would forego payouts for 2017 after the bank said it lost 735 million euros, the third annual loss in a row and more than the 497 million euros it had reported in February.
The bank, which distributed 546 million euros in bonuses in 2016, also said its cost-cutting plans were hitting roadblocks, partly because of a delay in disposals. 
In addition, the lender said it expected higher costs related to Britain's exit from the European Union - which is expected to lead to hundreds of the bank's staff moving from London - and a postponement in savings from the merger of its in-house retail bank with Postbank.
The bank's decision to push ahead with paying big bonuses, despite heavy losses, has tested relations with German politicians and the public, many of whom deeply disapprove of high pay and Anglo-Saxon style capitalism.
Chief Executive John Cryan, who has called for patience in his effort to turn around the bank, defended the bonus payments as an effort to retain staff. 
""If we want to live up to our claim of being the leading European bank with a global network, we have to invest in our employees so that we can continue to provide the best solutions for our clients,"" he said in a letter to shareholders.
Deutsche sharply cut bonuses for 2016 following speculation that it would need a state bailout to stay afloat.
Since then, the bank has executed an overhaul that includes the merger of its in-house retail bank with Postbank and the partial IPO of its asset management unit, which is expected to start trading next week. 
In its annual report, the bank said adjusted costs in 2018 were now expected to be 23 billion euros, up from its original forecast for 22 billion, and that some cost savings wouldn't kick in until 2019.
The bank was cautiously optimistic for this year, saying it expects revenues to rise in 2018 after declining 12 percent in 2017. ""We remain committed to our objective of delivering a net profit and a competitive dividend payout for 2018,"" Cryan said.
During his tenure, Cryan has stabilized the bank, raised capital, designed an overhaul, cut some costs, confronted daunting legal challenges, and managed the demands of greater regulation.
But the 2017 loss has prompted some investors to question whether Cryan should be given more time to turn around the bank, after less than three years as chief executive.
Investors are also frustrated by paltry dividends, which the bank said would be 11 cents for 2017, resulting in a payout for investors of 230 million euros.
""The stark mismatch between bonuses and dividends must be remedied in the next few years,"" said Ingo Speich, a fund manager at Union Investment, which holds Deutsche stock.
Shares in Deutsche Bank were 0.2 percent higher at 1121 GMT, up less than the broader DAX index of major German companies as investors ignored news of the bigger loss.

612,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 08:04AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Packager SIG Combibloc seeks Zurich listing in autumn - sources,"By Arno Schuetze, Dasha Afanasieva and Oliver Hirt
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Swiss packaging maker SIG Combibloc is preparing an autumn stock market listing in Zurich that could value it at about 4.5 billion euros ($5.5 billion), three people close to the matter said.
Its private equity owner Onex (TO:ONEX) has hired Rothschild (PA:ROTH) as an IPO adviser, and other investment banks have also been contacted regarding their interest in helping organize a potential deal, the sources said.
A spokesman said SIG did not comment on speculation about its capital market plans. Rothschild declined to comment, while Onex was not immediately available for comment.
SIG makes cartons for beverages and food and competes with larger rival Tetra Pak, a unit of Tetra Laval. It is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about 450 million euros this year. 
A listing may value the company at 9-10 times that, including debt, in line with other peers including Bery (N:BERY), Ball (N:BLL), Silgan (O:SLGN), Bemis (N:BMS) or Polyone (N:POL), the sources said. 
Onex bought SIG in 2015 from New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart in a deal valued at 3.75 billion euros ($4.62 billion) that left the Canadian private equity company and SIG's management as 100 percent owners.
In an increasingly crowded European equity raising market, Switzerland is seeing a flurry of stock market listings, including medical devices maker Medartis and sensor maker Sensirion announced this week. 
Rothschild is also working on the Zurich IPO of cargo handler Swissport and, on an as yet unspecified exchange, the listing of logistics firm Ceva, sources have said.
SIG had been listed in Switzerland before as part of the Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) conglomerate that made everything from juice cartons and passenger trains and military weapons. Its businesses were gradually sold off as the company trimmed its focus to packaging.
At the time of Onex's purchase in 2015, the firm had seven production facilities across Europe, South America and Asia Pacific. It currently employs than 5,000 people at about 40 locations around the world.

The European Union has been pushing for talks to avert a trade war since U.S. President Donald Trump announced he would slap tariffs on a raft of high-value European exports in retaliation for alleged steel and aluminium dumping.
The conditions named by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer at a Brussels meeting with EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom also included a promise that Brussels take measures against steel dumping from China and cooperate in a wide range of other trade issues, Spiegel reported on Friday.
He also set out conditions in the field of defence policy - Europe had to provide ""proof"" that it would step up its armaments efforts, the newsmagazine said.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Malmstrom have agreed to meet next week to try to resolve the deepening dispute over trade tariffs, a European Commission source said on Thursday.

BOSTON (Reuters) -  State Street  Corp (N:STT) wants answers from companies that lack such things as independent board leaders or equal voting rights for investors, a top executive at the asset manager said, which could spell weaker support for some companies whose shares it controls.
Boston-based State Street and other top fund firms last year adopted a set of good-corporate-governance principles meant to improve oversight at companies whose shares they hold. 
""We're going to be asking companies to explain either their compliance or exceptions"" from the new principles, Rakhi Kumar, head of asset stewardship for State Street's asset-management arm, said in a telephone interview late on Thursday.
State Street had $2.8 trillion under management as of Dec 31.
Companies that cannot adequately explain their structures can expect votes against management's recommendations, according to a recent State Street memo sent to corporate directors.
Fund firms are worried by the rise of corporate structures that concentrate power with insiders, such as last year's initial public offering by  Snap Inc  (N:SNAP) that included no voting rights for outside investors.
Critics have said the asset managers could do more to enforce their governance concerns, such as refusing to buy the shares.
Kumar said that is not always possible for State Street's index funds, but the burden will be on company leaders. ""We want to make sure that you're shareholder friendly and you're putting thought into governance,"" she said.
State Street and rivals BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) and Vanguard Group have emerged as dominant shareholders of most publicly traded U.S. companies, as investors pour billions into the firms' passive investment strategies.
The firms in turn have emphasized environmental, social and governance concerns to attract investor assets. State Street has recently pressed gun makers for safety details after last month's high school shooting in Florida, and last year placed the ""Fearless Girl"" statue near Wall Street to highlight its efforts to promote gender diversity.
But filings later showed State Street funds abstained on some shareholder resolutions focused on boardroom diversity. Kumar said it was too soon to provide new details about talks with gun makers and she declined to discuss votes or outreach at specific companies. 

But she said State Street may cast ""abstain"" proxy votes more often this year to signal its unhappiness with management. Such votes will give State Street a way to convey nuance, she said, whereas before it might have backed management but ""with a heavy heart.""

Chairman Powell himself hinted at that possibility during his congressional hearings, saying his outlook for the economy has strengthened.Even if the FOMC doesn't explicitly state a change in policy, it may provide strong clues to which way it is leaning in its new summary of economic projections for GDP growth, inflation and the unemployment rate.¬†"

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing, announced his retirement as chairman of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd (HK:0001) on Friday, bringing to a close a rags-to-riches story that made him a hero in the freewheeling capitalist hub.
Li, 89, will retire after the annual general meeting on May 10, the ports-to-telecoms conglomerate said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse. A factory apprentice when he was 13, Li, was called ""Superman"" for his work ethic and business success. 
While Hong Kong's adoration of the billionaire and his story has waned somewhat in recent years, he is still stepping aside from one of Asia's most outward-looking empires, spanning more than 50 countries and 323,000 employees at last count.
""I've been working for a long time, too long,"" a relaxed Li told reporters.
Li will, as expected, stay on as senior adviser. His eldest son Victor Li, who was named successor several years ago, will take over the reins of the business. Victor, already on the board, is seen as a steady hand unlikely to change course.
""I've always said I could go on a trip anytime, the company would still run the same way,"" Li said.
During his tenure, Li had increased the pace of overseas acquisitions, helping boost the group's profits with growth in the European telecoms business offsetting a drop in the value of the British business following Brexit.
Through his flagship CK Hutchison, Li controls the biggest container port operator in the world, Canadian oil giant  Husky Energy Inc  (TO:HSE), one of Europe's leading telecoms operators, as well as infrastructure assets and a long-time interest in Britain that saw him awarded a knighthood in 2000.
""Li Ka-shing is remarkable - he's a role model and I regard him as such,"" said Stuart Gulliver, former CEO of HSBC who in a 38-year career with the bank worked closely with Li.
It was HSBC's 1979 sale to Li of a stake in Hutchison Whampoa, a colonial-era trading house, that vaulted him into the first rank of Chinese tycoons. 
Commending Li's long laid-out succession plan, unusual among tycoons in a region where discussing death is often viewed as unlucky, Gulliver praised Victor for being extremely capable.
""He's also been very actively involved - he has been running it day to day and he has been for some time,"" Gulliver said. 
STRONG RESULTS AT LI'S COMPANIES
The news of retirement came together with the announcement of better-than-expected results at some of Li's biggest firms.
CK Hutchison reported a 6 percent rise in 2017 profit to HK$35.1 billion ($4.48 billion), versus the average forecast of HK$34.63 billion from 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.
The real estate arm CK Asset Holdings Limited (HK:1113) saw annual profits surge 55 percent, also beating estimates.
""Healthy and synchronized growth in major economies gathered pace in 2017. Provided this trend continues and inflation remains benign, the environment in 2018 should remain supportive for global trade and for our businesses,"" Li said.
Li, who ranked 23rd on the world's rich list by Forbes, is the wealthiest tycoon in Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to China in 1997.
Over the past few years, Li's close ties with Beijing's Communist Party leadership have come under scrutiny. He has never been publicly over-critical.
""I like to read history very much... and about my country. If I can vote today, on the constitutional reform (in China) so (President) Xi (Jinping) can go for another term ... I will vote for him,"" Li said. 
""My relationship with the central government is pretty good. But personally I don't say things that I shouldn't say.""
There was a media report last year indicating Li would retire in 2018, but the billionaire businessman had brushed it off, saying he had not yet decided when to step down and that he would stay on as an adviser even after retirement.
CK Hutchison shares closed up 0.3 percent on Friday, versus a 0.1 percent fall in the benchmark Hang Seng index (HSI).

621,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Singapore's 'en-bloc' redevelopment fever may be cooling,"By Aradhana Aravindan
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singaporean engineer Andy Goh has stopped saying hello to some neighbors in his condominium. 
The mood in the 596-apartment Cashew Heights complex is ""tense and stressed"" after an initiative late last year to offer it for collective sale to a property developer, said Goh, 49. 
A firm opponent of the deal, worth at least S$1.88 billion ($1.43 billion), he feels outnumbered by owners who want to cash out. Recalling a meeting in his condominium last month, Goh, who worries the sale price won't allow him to buy a new home of comparable size, said his dissenting voice was drowned out by the other owners.
Singapore has seen a frenzy of so-called en-bloc deals over the last two years in the redevelopment market, a phenomenon that has made some Singaporeans millionaires, inspired hit television shows and turned neighbors into enemies. 
David Wong, a member of Cashew Heights' pro-en bloc committee, said owners can sell their apartments for at least double the price in a collective sale compared with individually.
""I think the financial reason surpasses the sentimental reasons,"" he said, adding that those who did not want to sell have a vote. Under Singapore law, 80 percent of the owners in an older development need to approve the sale before tender.
The drama of Singapore's property market has been captured in two television shows called ""En Bloc."" In one episode, an anti-en-bloc owner's property is vandalized, while a letter spreads rumors of bad feng shui in another episode. 
More than a combined S$8 billion ($6 billion) worth of such deals were signed in 2017 - the highest in a decade amid a nascent recovery in the housing market. 
Redevelopment is seen as key to optimizing land use in the city-state, home to 5.6 million people in about 700 square kilometers.
EN-BLOC FATIGUE
But the pace of redevelopment sales has started to show signs of slowing, with recent government measures helping dampen the euphoria, including an increase in stamp duty for home purchases of more than S$1 million.
Traffic impact studies are now required to ensure redevelopment will not trigger congestion. The development levy for enhancing sites or building bigger projects on them was raised by an average of 22.8 percent - the biggest increase in a decade. 
""I think if you look, definitely the window is closing a bit,"" said Desmond Sim, research head for Singapore and Southeast Asia at real estate services firm CBRE. 
He said recent collective sales had gone through at the minimum asking prices, developers sated after last year's buying spree and sellers' expectations sky-high.
""The exuberance of putting in high premiums has gone,"" he said.
The average premium above asking price has fallen to 2.9 percent this year from 10 percent in 2017, according to an analysis using data through late February by real estate services firm Cushman and Wakefield.
Aggressive land bids prompted the central bank in November to warn of ""excessive exuberance"" in the property market, urging developers to factor in new projects slated to open.
Derek Tan and Rachel Tan, equity research analysts at Singapore's largest lender, DBS, said last month there appeared to be ""a bit of fatigue"" in the en bloc market, citing recent deals' relatively low pricing.
""The fact that most of the sites have also been awarded at reserve price levels, rather than a premium, may indicate that developers are turning more choosy in adding to their land bank and becoming more cautious in their pricing strategy,"" they wrote.
S$3.2 MILLION AND DOWNSIZING
Those transactions included the S$728 million sale of the Pearl Bank Apartments, the tallest residential structure when it was completed in 1976, to CapitaLand (SI:CATL) through private negotiations after an unsuccessful public tender. 
""The asking price from the owners in all these recent en blocs is getting higher and higher. There must be a tipping point,"" said Ronald Tay, chief executive at CapitaLand Singapore.
Developers may also be opting more for the government land sales (GLS) program rather than en-bloc deals, which can take more than a year to close.
""I would say that we definitely have a slight preference at this stage toward GLS because the turnaround is faster,"" said Sherman Kwek, chief executive officer at City Developments (SI:CTDM), although he did not rule out more en bloc deals. 
Cushman estimates that Singapore developers have about S$18.9 billion available for more near-term land acquisitions.
Analysts say developers have been building smaller apartments to keep prices palatable to buyers, even as land costs rise. Consultancy JLL estimates the median size of apartments sold directly by developers fell to 69 square meters in 2016 from 111 square meters in 2009.
Goh will receive S$3.2 million for his three-bedroom apartment, where he lives with his wife and four children, if the sale of his development, built in the early '90s, goes ahead.
He has been trying band together with other owners who oppose the sale, and laments that no new condominium estates will match the space or open layout that he likes about his neighborhood.
""Even if it is 'en bloced' at S$3.2 million, I couldn't get a unit that is equivalent in size,"" he said.

622,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 07:54AM ET</span>","A factory worker at 13, Hong Kong's iconic billionaire retires","By James Pomfret and Jennifer Hughes
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Li Ka-shing's rise from penniless immigrant in 1940 to billionaire tycoon is the consummate success story in Hong Kong, a city which progressed alongside him from trading outpost to one of the world's biggest financial centers.
A factory apprentice when he was 13, Li, who announced his retirement on Friday at 89, was called ""Superman"" in the ultra-capitalist hub for his work ethic and business success.
Li has used his business acumen, as well as a habit of personally investing alongside his companies, to amass a fortune estimated by Forbes at $35.3 billion, making him the world's 23rd richest man.
""I've been working for a long time, too long,"" a relaxed and sprightly Li said on Friday after announcing he would step down on May 10.
While Hong Kong's adoration of the billionaire and his rags-to-riches story has waned somewhat in recent years, he is still stepping aside from one of Asia's most outward-looking empires, spanning more than 50 countries and 323,000 employees at last count.
Through a career spanning the 78 years since his family fled war-torn China for Hong Kong, Li built fortunes first in plastics and property before joining the first wave of top-tier Chinese tycoons in the city with the 1979 purchase of Hutchison Whampoa, a venerable British ""hong"" or trading house.
Along the way, he led raids on rivals, built strong - later controversial - ties with mainland leaders, was rapped on the knuckles for insider dealing in Hong Kong and turned his sights to overseas expansion in a way that few of his local rivals ever did.
Also unlike his rivals, including fellow hongs Swire Pacific (HK:0019) and Jardine Matheson (SI:JARD), he proved adept at something else: selling assets. 
""Li Ka-shing's real genius, to me, is not necessarily in the assets he acquired, but his ability to sell them at the right time,"" said Jonathan Galligan, head of Asia gaming and conglomerates research at CLSA, the brokerage. ""Look at anything he sold and, plus or minus a year, its hard to say he didn't pick the top ‚Äì that's a tremendous skill.""
One of Li's best-known deals in this respect was the 1999 sale of its UK telecoms unit, Orange, to Germany's Mannesmann at the height of a market boom. After  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) bought Mannesmann soon after, the subsequent forced disposal of Orange to France Telecom produced a second windfall for the Li empire, which netted $21 billion in profits from the two deals.
Today, the assets still held by Li through his flagship CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd (HK:0001), include the biggest container port operator in the world, Canadian oil giant Husky, one of Europe's leading telecoms operators as well as a collection of UK businesses that saw him awarded a knighthood by the Queen in 2000.
Even after stepping down, Li, who turns 90 in July, will remain a senior adviser for his sprawling business empire.
MYTH AND REALITY
Shrouded in myth and filled with apocryphal anecdotes and tales of family misfortune, Li's name has become synonymous with against-the-odds success by dint of hard work.
He himself has regularly emphasized the hard work as well as his own drive to educate himself after becoming an apprentice in a watch strap factory at the age of 13, shortly before his father died.
By 19, he had become general manager of the factory, overseeing up to 300 workers and office staff, and at 21, he founded Cheung Kong plastics - the foundation of his empire.
That factory, with 1,000 square feet of space, operated around-the-clock, made a profit from its first year of operation and the young Li slept in a storage room in one of the many stories about his personal thrift.
Li, whose wife died nearly three decades ago, will hand over the keys to his empire to his elder son Victor Li, who, unlike younger son Richard, keeps a low public profile.
But despite the fables of Li's thrift and being an active philanthropist, many Hong Kongers resent the pervasive role his family plays in the local economy.
They also blame the oligopolistic dominance of tycoons such as Li for social ills including a gaping wealth gap, extensive harbor reclamation, heritage demolition and extortionate property prices.
It is true that it would be difficult to spend a day in Hong Kong without enriching the Li empire and Hong Kongers sometimes use a Cantonese pun on his name, which translates to ""Li family city"". Li's Hongkong Electric is one of two power utilities in the city, while Cheung Kong is one of Hong Kong's biggest residential developers. His companies also control one of the two dominant supermarket chains and one of the two largest pharmacies as well as one of Hong Kong's largest cellphone companies.
Economists have joked privately that Li's businesses give him better first-hand knowledge of the health of the Hong Kong economy than any amount of government information ever could.
END OF AN ERA
Li is the most prominent of the city's powerful tycoons or oligarchs to step aside for the next generation, an exclusive peer group that also include Lee Shau-kee of Henderson Land, six months Li's senior.
While these tycoons still control large swathes of Hong Kong, namely its core property sector, Chinese capital and businesses have become more intertwined with the city's economic fabric, challenging their dominance as the streets are increasingly lined with mainland-backed banks, petrol stations, shops and supermarkets.
Over the past few years, Li's close ties with Beijing's Communist Party leadership have come under scrutiny.
Li came under rare attack by some Chinese state media outlets a few years ago, who accused him of abandoning China by selling off some assets there. Li, however, has denied turning his back on China and says he is confident in the country and its president Xi Jinping.
Though rarely accessible in recent years, the bespectacled tycoon enjoys shooting from the hip during public appearances and hasn't shied from making controversial and politically barbed comments. 
His lieutenants have however tended to be more circumspect - at least when it comes to commenting on Li. Asked in 2015 for his thoughts about what a surprise wholesale restructuring of the Li empire meant for the family's succession planning, Canning Fok, Li's second-in-command, told reporters, to laughter, that ""We don't interpret what the big boss says.""
And asked this week by Reuters for his thoughts on any retirement by Li, Simon Murray, Fok's predecessor, kept it brief, replying via email simply ""Happy Retirement!""
Li, though, has fresh challenges in mind.

""I will don a new battle suit and put all my efforts into the work of my (charity) foundation, especially on the aspects of medicine and education.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, led by NEX Group as it jumped after a takeover offer, though stocks were on track to end the week with a loss as worries about a trade war and geopolitical tensions kept investors on edge.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index was up 0.1 percent by 0954 GMT.
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) index rose 0.3 percent following a delayed open. The first day of trading got off to a bumpy start for Siemens Healthineers (DE:SHLG), which gained just over 5 percent. 
Worries about a possible trade war have hung over equities since U.S. President Donald Trump announced this month that he would introduce tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, while a shakeup of the president's cabinet has also dampened the mood.
The STOXX 600 was on track to post a loss of around 0.3 percent for the week.

625,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 04:20AM ET</span>",Russia bondholders happy to hug sovereign as sanctions talk swirls,"By Claire Milhench
LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors are unlikely to start shunning Russia's sovereign debt even though Russian entities and individuals are seen at risk of further sanctions over a nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Britain.
Britain has pinned the attack on Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats, while the United States announced more sanctions on Thursday for election meddling. 
But asset managers said Russia was unlikely to be shut out of international capital markets. 
""In the worst case you might have a sanctions spiral from the UK, U.S. and EU, but this will remain a very negative tail risk ... and not be my base case scenario,"" said Sergey Dergachev, functional head of EM corporate debt at Germany-based Union Investment.
The premium investors demand to hold Russian sovereign dollar debt over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries <.JPMEGDRUSR> has risen by 13 basis points this week to 175 bps.
That is the widest this year but still well below the highs of 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and sanctions were imposed on a swathe of Russian companies and individuals. 
Russia opened order books on Thursday for a new 11-year Eurobond, providing a test of market appetite.
SAFER OPTION
Many emerging debt managers say they cannot ignore Russia as its inclusion in key benchmarks mean they risk underperforming if they have no exposure.
And holding sovereign debt has been seen as the safer option for managers wanting to avoid the minefield in Russian corporates, where different rules in different jurisdictions can create a compliance headache.
""It (Russian sovereign debt) will be the last to be hit by sanctions if there is a strong escalation,"" said Raphael Marechal, head portfolio manager, emerging markets, at Nikko Asset Management. 
""A lot of people want to be on the safe side -- they don't want to become forced sellers of Russian assets. If you buy a corporate now, you don't know if there is a second round of sanctions and then you have to sell your position."" 
Most currently sanctioned names have not tapped international markets since 2014, switching mostly to the rouble bond market or domestic banks. This has led to a scarcity premium for some names, although some managers said the valuation effect was negligible. 
For many, Russia remains a positive story, despite sanctions on big state-owned firms such as Sberbank and VTB.
""Russia has proven it has extreme resilience regarding the corporate sanctions,"" said Viktor Szabo, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""On the margin it increases the cost of capital, but it is not something Russia cannot live with.""
Sanctions did not prevent S&P Global lifting Russia to investment grade in February, its second such rating, widening its access to capital as Russian debt is now eligible for benchmarks tracked by trillions of dollars worldwide.
CORPORATE UPGRADES
Some Russian corporates have also been upgraded, presenting a problem for passive managers who are trying to avoid exposure to sanctioned names. 
""The wide-reaching sanctions from a number of different countries is likely to be an issue for international managers,"" said Abhishek Kumar, lead investment manager for emerging markets fixed income beta at State Street Global Advisors (SSGA). 
The addition of Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), VEB and Russian Railways to the Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Global Aggregate index, which is tracked by an estimated $2-$3 trillion, has helped lift Russia's weighting to 0.33 percent from 0.17 percent at the start of the year.
From March 29, Russia will also rejoin JPMorgan's investment-grade EMBI indexes, along with Russian Railways and VEB, with a combined weight of 6.8-8.6 percent. 
An estimated $54 billion in assets is benchmarked to these JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) indexes, which are important for conservative investors such as European insurance companies who may be reluctant to hold junk-rated securities. 
S&P Global also upgraded Gazprom Neft, VTB and Transneft to 'BBB-'. Along with Gazprom and VEB, these are all subject to sanctions in some form. 
The ratings agency said most Russian companies and banks had managed to retain adequate liquidity despite the sanctions, implying no immediate rating impact. 
Gazprom, for example, is a regular issuer in international markets and sold a 750 million euro Eurobond on Wednesday, despite being under various sanctions from the United States and Canada. There have also been U.S.-imposed restrictions on the provision of financing to Gazprom Neft, Gazprombank, Sberbank, VEB and VTB since September 2014.
""That's where the problem is,"" said Kumar. ""Most managers would take a very cautious approach to be on the safe side, investing in bonds issued before September 2014.""
Russian investments go through a much stricter vetting process at SSGA than other bonds, he added: ""It's reputational damage if you end up buying the wrong bond so a lot of scrutiny goes into the purchase.""

Elliot said it now holds more than 3 percent of TIM's ordinary shares, while together with financial instruments its disclosable interest exceeds 5 percent.

Mitsugu Yamaguchi faces a difficult challenge to rebuild credibility at the 112-year-old steelmaker, which sent shockwaves through global supply chains after revealing widespread tampering of specifications on products used in planes, trains and automobiles.
While no safety issues have been identified and the company's shares have recovered much of their sharp losses from the early days of the scandal, Kobe Steel faces a U.S. Department of Justice investigation that may yet prove costly.
Consumers in the United States and Canada have also filed lawsuits against Japan's third-largest steelmaker.
Kobe Steel has lost certificates of industrial quality that may make it harder to sell to certain customers. 
""I will fully carry out my responsibilities to prevent any recurrences and regain trust,"" Yamaguchi, 60, said at a press conference. 
He said the company was unlikely to seek a full merger with a rival, but that individual businesses could be combined with others.
Yamaguchi replaces Hiroya Kawasaki as president and chief executive officer on April 1 after the long-serving head of the company stepped down to take responsibility for the fraud that the company admitted had been going on for nearly five decades. Kawasaki remains a director of the company.
Yamaguchi heralds from Kobe Steel's machinery division, unlike many of his predecessors who had come from the company's mainstay steel business or its general affairs operations.
Kobe Steel last week released results from a four-month-long investigation by an external committee and said it had found new cases of impropriety, increasing the total number of affected clients to 605, including 222 overseas.
The company's data tampering came mostly from its aluminum and copper division, but some cheating cases were found at the steel division. 
The Kobe Steel case, one of the country's biggest industrial scandals in recent memory, set off a rash of malfeasance revelations by other Japanese heavyweights, hitting the country's reputation for manufacturing excellence.

634,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 01:17AM ET</span>",Ten years after JPMorgan/Bear Stearns deal banks may have already seen biggest gains,"By Sin√©ad Carew and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Ten years after JPMorgan (N:JPM) bought failing investment bank Bear Stearns, one of the first big harbingers of the financial crisis, investor views on U.S. banks are significantly brighter, although the sector may have already put its biggest gains behind it. 
JPMorgan initially announced its bid of $2 per share for Bear Stearns on March 16, 2008 when the Wall Street bank was on the brink of collapse due to its exposure to toxic mortgage bonds and a draining of its cash reserves after customers fled as the subprime mortgage crisis intensified. 
Fast forward ten years and U.S. bank balance sheets are much healthier as post-crisis regulations such as the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 forced banks to be more transparent and led them to shore up reserves and make less risky bets. 
The S&P 500 bank stock index <.SPXBK> shows gains for six of the last 10 years, including 20 percent gains in each of the last two years, as investors piled in for a piece of the profit expansion they expected from tax reform, rising interest rates and deregulation.
(GRAPHIC: Yearly Percent Changes: S&P 500 vs S&P 500 Banks - http://reut.rs/2FAAGOG)
But now some analysts and investors are questioning how much further the sector can rise as they watch loan growth, rising credit losses and worry about an acceleration in the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
""There's a lot priced into the banks at this point,"" said Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Boston citing bets on tax reform, deregulation and up to three U.S. interest rate hikes in 2018.
""To propel the bank stocks from here you need more of the same. You need additional signs of regulatory reform. You'd also need to see higher interest rates and more in the way of loan growth,"" said Morris. ""In loan growth we haven't seen much acceleration since the tax plan and the banks themselves aren't talking about seeing a real acceleration in loan growth."" 
Bank loans and leases grew 3.2 percent in 2017 compared with a 6.5 percent rise in 2016 and the growth rate had dipped to 2.7 percent by February, according to the Federal Reserve data. 
JPMorgan has come the furthest of the S&P bank stock index constituents with a price increase of 215 percent since March 14, the last trading day before its Bear deal was announced. 
Its shares are now trading at 12.7 times forward estimates compared with 12.5 for the broader bank sector and 17 for the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 stock index. In comparison JPMorgan's price earnings ration was 10.7 around the time of the Bear deal while the sector was valued at 12.3 and the S&P 500 had a multiple of 13. 
(GRAPHIC: Forward PE: S&P 500 vs S&P 500 Banks - http://reut.rs/2FKgmX3) 
Charles Peabody, analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading expects loan growth to pick up in 2018, but he is less convinced about credit cost trends. 
Credit costs have been low as banks became cautious about underwriting loans after the financial crisis, resulting in lower loan losses, but as the government eyes looser regulations and banks relax lending standards, Morris sees credit losses rising. 
""We don't see any particular credit crisis coming up,"" he said but predicted that losses would ""pick up over the next several years to get back to a more normal level."" 
Since consumer credit costs started to rise albeit gradually, in 2017, Compass Point's Peabody now expects costs from corporate loans to also reach an inflection point in 2018. 
""People are being overly optimistic in earnings estimates because they've not factored in higher costs for credit going forward,"" he said. ""I expect loan loss provisions for the big banks to double from current levels between now and at some point in 2019.""
Wall Street analysts expect S&P 500 index banks to report 26 percent earnings growth for 2018, compared with 12.3 percent for 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data, but Peabody is skeptical.
""The banks stocks will start to underperform at some point in the second half this year as people's optimism is not realized,"" he said.
Rising interest rates are also putting bank investors on edge. While rate increases tend to boost profits as banks can charge more for loans, if the rise is too steep it could dampen demand for mortgages or home refinancing loans. 

""The easy gains are behind us,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. ""In banks, rising rates are a positive and a negative. Right now it's a positive but at some point the negative aspects will come into play. Investors have to realize there's a danger level they have to watch for.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares in Leshi Internet Information & Technology Corp Beijing slumped 10 percent on Friday after its chairman resigned, fanning fears he would no longer play a white knight role for the embattled firm.
Sun Hongbin took on the job only eight months ago after a $2.2 billion investment by his property firm Sunac China Holdings, and had been seen as the main backer for the crumbling LeEco conglomerate, of which Leshi has been the main listed vehicle.
But financial woes at LeEco, which once aspired to be both China's Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), have only deepened with founder Jia Yueting in July defying court orders to return to China from the United States to pay debt owed by various LeEco units.
Sun's resignation were presaged by signs that he was losing confidence in Leshi. He told a Leshi shareholder briefing in February that he had underestimated the amount of Leshi's non-receivables.
Sun also asked to leave Leshi's board and quit all roles, according to a filing by the video streaming company on Wednesday which attributed the decision to a ""work adjustment"". General manager Liu Shuqing will be acting chairwoman until the board picks a replacement.
Leshi said in separate filings on Thursday it has no plans to bring in external investors but added that has confirmed with shareholders who hold more than 5 percent that they do not have plans to sell. 
As trade in its shares resumed on Friday after being halted on Wednesday afternoon, the stock fell by its daily limit of 10 percent to give it a market value of just $3.8 billion, far below its peak of $24 billion in 2015.
Leshi last month reported a preliminary net loss of 11.6 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) for 2017, more than five times its combined profits since listing on the Shenzhen stock exchange in 2010. 
It has said that Jia and related parties owe it 7.53 billion yuan ($1.2 billion), though Jia has disputed the figure.

HAIKOU, China (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers pour concrete as tower cranes swing overhead at the building site where a giant skyscraper is set to soar above the palm-fringed streets of this tropical Chinese city.
The building is the first of two towers that will serve as the gateway to a 200-hectare new central business district in downtown Haikou, capital of the island-province of Hainan in southern China.
The project is being constructed by HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], the widely scrutinized and highly leveraged aviation-to-financial services conglomerate that got its start in Hainan 25 years ago as a regional airline with just two aircraft.
But HNA is now looking to shed at least some of its sprawling interests in the huge 100 billion yuan ($15.84 billion) business district, as it has done with many of the interests the company has amassed in a $50 billion global spending spree. 
HNA is currently in talks with potential ""strategic partners"" for parts of the development, which a range of investors also have stakes in, according to sources familiar with the situation, even as it prepares to re-organize its operations and shrink its workforce.
The search for investors in HNA's hometown underlines the difficulties the company is facing as it struggles under the weight of the debt it racked up during its rapid expansion.
HNA told major bank creditors in January that it faced a potential cash shortfall of at least 15 billion yuan in the first quarter.
In the last two months, HNA has sold more than $6 billion in prime real estate in Australia, New York and Hong Kong, while selling shares in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), Park Hotels & Resorts (N:PK), and  Hilton Grand Vacations Inc  (N:HGV).
On Monday, HNA Infrastructure Investment Group (SS:600515), one of the key developers of the Haikou business district, said it would sell a Hainan-based property company and logistics unit to  Sunac  China (HK:1918), a real estate developer, for 1.9 billion yuan.
When asked for comment on the stake sales, the company said in a statement that ""HNA is always looking for trusted partners"".
The master plan for the Haikou business district includes 23 office buildings, residential compounds, and a massive luxury shopping mall. The first of the Haikou Twin Towers, 94-floors high, is scheduled to open in 2020, and will include a St. Regis Hotel.
Anchored in the center of the district is the Hainan provincial government, with HNA's headquarters, a Buddha-shaped tower, sitting just down the road.
A COMPANY ISLAND
Hainan is in many ways an HNA company island. HNA Group operates 92 enterprises across the province, employing 30,000 workers, with total assets of nearly $50 billion. It is Hainan's biggest money maker, with total revenues outstripping the combined sales of the province's next nine largest companies combined. 
HNA is also critical to local government efforts to establish Hainan as a regional and global tourist destination. 
The group operates the island's three commercial airports and its flagship Hainan Airlines operates 17 international and regional routes from the province and transports about 45 percent of all visitors arriving by air here. 
The company is currently investing 15.3 billion yuan for a second runway and terminal for Haikou's international airport, part of an expansion to accommodate 35 million visits by 2025. 
The branded tailfin of Hainan Airlines, which travels to 110 cities worldwide, has elevated the province's name around the world, said Edward Tse, chief executive of Gao Feng Advisory Company, who previously advised Chinese companies at Booz & Company and Boston Consulting Group. 
""HNA is a business card for Hainan province,"" Tse said. 
Hainan's governor, Shen Xiaoming, who visited HNA's Haikou headquarters in November just as the severity of the company's financial struggles emerged, underscored the importance of the group to the province's development. 
""HNA took root in Hainan, understands Hainan, implemented a new development concept in Hainan, and built a modern economic system in Hainan,"" Shen said. ""If HNA is good, then Hainan is good; when Hainan is good, then HNA is better.""
GOVERNMENT CLEAN-UP
HNA and other non-state conglomerates in China have meanwhile been under intensifying pressure from Beijing to clean up operations and deleverage their businesses.
In recent weeks, Chinese regulators have taken control of Anbang Insurance Group. The government is also investigating the chairman of CEFC, which has agreed to take a $10 billion stake in the Russian oil major Rosneft.
HNA executives have recently elevated their patriotic rhetoric and have tethered company goals closely to those of Beijing.
HNA Capital, for instance, announced on Feb 27 that it was helping to raise 20 billion yuan to help fund projects along China's new Silk Road trade initiative. 
HNA's cause is the ""cause of the party, the cause of the people and the cause of all mankind"", Chen Feng told HNA's Communist Party members on Feb 7, according to a company report.
HNA's co-chairman, Wang Jian, voiced a darker message, telling employees that the company's difficulties were the result of a ""major conspiracy"" against the party and President Xi Jinping by foreign and domestic ""reactionary forces"", according to an internally-distributed email.
China's leading industrial conglomerates and technology companies all have Communist Party committees, and such rhetoric is not unusual now, said Tse of Gao Feng Advisory.
OFFICIAL SUPPORT
At the same time, HNA is engaged in a wrenching reorganization of both its domestic and overseas businesses.
Other foreign assets involved in the group-wide debt reduction program include a 29.5 percent shareholding in the Spanish hospitality firm NH Hotel Group (MC:NHH) that is up for sale, and the Swiss airline services firms Gategroup and Swissport, which are being prepared for listings.
At home, HNA is undertaking a massive reorganization of its businesses, which include aviation, tourism, healthcare, technology and financial services assets. 
Still, repayment of group borrowing, which surged by more than one-third over the first 11 months of last year to 637.5 billion yuan, has been exacerbated by liquidity issues, including the inability to pay a 3 billion yuan aviation fuel bill owed to China National Aviation Fuel Group Ltd by its airlines.
However, the company appears to be getting crucial official support to help it survive, even if it's unlikely to receive a direct government lifeline.
Hainan's vice governor, Mao Chaofeng, told Reuters in Beijing last week that the province wouldn't need to intervene, given the quality of HNA's assets. The State Council Information Office, which acts as the public relations arm of the Chinese government, declined to comment.
HNA has since the end of the year received credit from leading state banks, including Citic Bank, which in February extended the group a 20 billion yuan facility.
Also in February, HNA Infrastructure announced it had obtained a 7.8 billion yuan loan issued by China Development Bank, and the Hainan branches of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China, to help complete its work on Haikou's international airport.
HNA also has been leaning on the more than 100 strategic relationships it has with provincial, municipal and local governments across the country, while pursuing fresh regional cooperation deals. 
For example, in the northern municipality of Tianjin, where it employs nearly 10,000 workers and operates a regional airline and cargo facilities, HNA is working with the government to create an international shipping center. 
These deals have helped HNA gain crucial credit support from regional banks.
They also underline the extent to which the survival of the sprawling behemoth is important to regional governments, and Beijing.
For China, the stakes are high, said William Kirby, a professor at Harvard Business School who has authored a case study on HNA.
""It's reputationally important for China to get this right,"" Kirby said. ""At the end of the day, HNA needs to be deemed a successful Chinese and international company.""

(Reuters) -  Nike  (NYSE:NKE) Inc's namesake brand President Trevor Edwards has resigned and will retire in August, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday.
Earlier on Thursday the Wall Street Journal, citing an internal memo, reported that Nike had received in recent weeks reports of ""behavior occurring within our organization that do not reflect our core values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment.""
There has been ""conduct inconsistent with Nike's core values and against our code of conduct,"" the spokeswoman said, adding that there have been no direct allegations of misconduct against Edwards.
""When we hear of claims we investigate and take the appropriate action,"" she said.
Edwards will now serve as an adviser to Nike Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker until his retirement, she added.
Elliott Hill, the former president of Nike Geographies, will take on the new role of president of consumer and marketplace, Nike said.
Parker will remain chief executive and chairman beyond 2020, Nike said.
The moves come nearly a year after Nike made several changes to its leadership structure and streamlined its business segments to four from six. It also eliminated a quarter of its shoe styles and cut 2 percent of its workforce.
Edwards was in charge of that initiative.
In the memo, Parker said Nike was conducting a review of the company's human-resources systems and practices for elevating internal complaints, according to the newspaper. ""This has been a very difficult time,"" he wrote, according to the Journal. 
Parker did not specify the nature of the complaints or whether they involved Edwards or any other executives, the Journal said. 

Shares of Nike, which is scheduled to report third-quarter results next Thursday, were up marginally in trading after the bell.

639,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 01:44AM ET</span>","Toyota, Uber in talks on self-driving tech: Nikkei","TOKYO (Reuters) - Uber Technologies is discussing the possibility of installing its self-driving system in Toyota Motor Co (T:7203) vehicles as the U.S. ride-hailing firm seeks to sell its autonomous driving technology to outside companies, the Nikkei reported on Friday.
Without citing sources, the Japanese business daily said that the firms are negotiating a possible deal for Toyota to use Uber's automated driving technology in one of the automaker's minivan models, and that Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi had met with Toyota executives in the United States this week. 
Toyota, which is developing its own automated driving functions, has said it is open to collaborating with other firms to quickly bring new mobility technologies to market. It already has partnerships with Uber on ride-hailing and development of self-driving systems. 
""We regularly exchange information about automated driving with Uber for some time now,"" a spokeswoman said, adding that no decisions have been made beyond its existing partnership. 
Global automakers and tech companies are racing to develop self-driving cars as the rise of autonomous, on-demand vehicle services upends the traditional business model of personal transportation that is largely based on individual car ownership. 
As it battles with Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Waymo to develop self-driving car services, Uber has been testing autonomous vehicles in the United States, and has been working with Volvo Cars and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) on driverless cars. 
In January, the Japanese automaker said it was working with Uber to develop a system of self-driving vehicles for tasks including ride hailing and parcel delivery. 
Toyota is an investor in Uber, and offers flexible vehicle leasing terms for Uber drivers. It has declined to comment on its size of its stake in the company.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's competition regulator said on Friday it was suing credit reporting company Equifax Pty Ltd, owned by U.S.-based  Equifax Inc  (N:EFX), alleging it misled consumers and used unfair tactics with people in financial hardship.
The alleged consumer law breaches by Equifax's Australian unit, which it bought in February 2016 and rebranded from Veda Advantage, mark the second legal challenge this week involving the Atlanta-based company. 
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleged that from June 2013 to March 2017, Equifax misled consumers, telling them its paid credit reports provided more complete information than its free reports, which they did not.
""It is alleged that Equifax acted unconscionably in its dealings with vulnerable consumers including by making false or misleading representations, and using unfair tactics and undue pressure when dealing with people in financial hardship,"" the ACCC said. 
The allegations come just days after the U.S. government filed criminal and civil charges against a former Equifax executive over alleged insider trading linked to last year's massive data breach at the credit reporting company
That was the first time that the U.S. government had pursued insider trading charges against somebody accused of profiting from information about a cyber attack. 
In Australia, the ACCC also alleged Equifax told customers they had to buy reports if they wanted to edit their own credit history, when in fact the company was required by law to take ""reasonable steps"" to keep accurate and current records.
""We allege that Equifax told people they needed to buy credit reporting services from them in situations when they did not,"" ACCC Commissioner Sarah Court said.
Equifax said in an emailed statement it had ""fully cooperated"" with the ACCC's investigation and was reviewing the allegations. 

""We acknowledge that the experience was unsatisfactory for some consumers when dealing with Equifax and we are carefully reviewing our processes and making changes to improve that,"" Mike Cutter, Asia Pacific Managing Director said.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2018 09:09AM ET</span>",Markets watchful as U.S. turmoil tests investors' nerves,"By Danilo Masoni
MILAN (Reuters) - World stocks wavered and the dollar eased on Friday as turmoil in the Trump administration kept markets watchful at the end of a week scarred by concerns that U.S. tariffs could provoke a trade war.
The MSCI All-Country World index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks 47 countries, was flat after three straight sessions of losses and was set for a weekly fall of around 0.6 percent. 
European shares found some support in dealmaking activity although the STOXX 600 (STOXX) was on track for a 0.3 percent weekly loss. That followed losses in Asia and in the U.S. overnight, while stock index futures pointed to a flat open for Wall Street ahead of the release of some macroeconomic data.
S&P 500 futures (ESc1) were up 0.05 percent.
The New York Times reported that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had issued a subpoena for documents, including some concerning Russia, related to President Donald Trump's businesses.
""Trump isn't giving markets much respite,"" said Rabobank analyst Bas van Geffen in a note. ""While still vague at best, the subpoena does bring the investigation yet another step closer to the president. Markets certainly didn't like the added uncertainty."" 
Although world equities were set for a weekly loss, huge inflows helped limit the decline. According to figures from flows tracker EPFR cited by BAML, a record $43.3 billion was driven into equities this week.
""Markets have been buoyed by strong inflows, but I think the under current in terms of news on the trade front is quite poor and I don‚Äôt think it has played out yet,"" said Gautam Batra, head of investments at Mediolanum Asset Management.
The Washington Post reported Trump has decided to remove H.R. McMaster as his national security advisor.
This follows the departures of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and top economic adviser Gary Cohn, adding to concerns about the implications for U.S. policy.
The developments, together with a report earlier this week that Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, cemented investors' worries that the administration is increasingly leaning towards protectionism.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has said that Trump would get options in the coming weeks to address China's ""theft and forced transfer"" of American intellectual property as part of an investigation.
""The key here is whether the main battle ground of the trade war will reach IT digital products,"" said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial Holding. 
The U.S. administration is negotiating to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement and last week announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, which have weighed on shares in some European steelmakers and industrial companies. Trump has offered exemptions from the tariffs to NAFTA members Canada and Mexico. 
A phone call between U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom to resolve the tariff dispute failed to bring results as they agreed to meet next week, a source said.
Fears that the tariffs could disrupt synchronized global growth dwarfed recent strong economic data, including a fall in U.S. jobless claims.
In currency markets, reports of the possible removal of U.S. security adviser McMaster weighed on the dollar, sending it to its lowest level against the yen since early March. The euro traded up 0.14 percent at $1.232 (EUR=), having slipped 0.5 percent the previous day. 
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was down 0.17 percent at 89.986, easing after two days following remarks from incoming White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow who said he would like the dollar to be stronger. 
Weakness in the dollar helped copper prices recover from early falls, as a weaker dollar makes metals cheaper for holders of other currencies. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange  was up 0.57 percent at $6,960 a tonne.
Oil prices edged up but were set to fall this week on concerns among investors about rising supply from the United States and elsewhere threatening to undermine efforts by OPEC and other producers to tighten the market.
Brent futures (LCOc1) rose 0.17 percent at $65.23 per barrel. 
Southern European government bonds outperformed their higher-rated peers as another ECB policymaker warned that inflation in the euro zone is still proving elusive, a potential hurdle to the withdrawal of monetary stimulus. 
Other euro zone bond yields also dipped. Germany's 10-year bond touched a fresh five-week low of 0.57 percent. (DE10YT=RR) 

U.S. Treasuries yields inched up to 2.829 percent (US10YT=RR) after having hit a near two-week low of 2.797 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield (US2YT=RR) eased after hitting a 9 1/2-year high of 2.295 percent as investors prepared for a widely expected interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve next week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) wants women to make up half of its global workforce, starting with new analysts by 2021, the Wall Street bank said on Thursday, as it stepped up efforts to address gender and racial imbalance across the board. 
""The advancement of women in the workplace ‚Äì and more broadly the state of diversity at our firm ‚Äì is top of mind for all of us,"" Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and President and co-Chief Operating Officer David Solomon said in an internal memo posted on its website. 
""While we have made progress in recent years on women's representation and ethnic and racial diversity, there is still significant progress to be made,"" they said. 
Solomon said in January that despite some progress in recent years, the fifth largest U.S. bank had not raised the proportion of women in its workforce to an adequate level, particularly in senior management.
Sources close to Solomon, who earlier this week effectively became CEO-in-waiting after another likely successor announced his retirement, describe him as a strong advocate for diversity.
Goldman's initial target is to have 50 percent of women in its incoming analyst class by 2021, according to the memo. The percentage of women in its 2018 full-time analyst class was in the high-40s, up from the low-40s last year.

The bank is also striving to hire more women and diverse professionals from other companies, the memo said.

U.S. District Judge Lorna Schofield in Manhattan said the investors failed to show they had legal standing to pursue antitrust claims, or that the banks' alleged conspiracy in the $5.1-trillion-a-day currency market was the proximate cause of their losses.
The plaintiffs claimed they were injured by having bought currencies from dealers that did not rig prices, but which passed on the costs of the conspiracy. They said the conspiracy included the defendants' alleged use of chat rooms with such names as ""The Cartel"" and ""The Mafia.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Nestle SA's (S:NESN) chairman gave a vote of confidence to Chief Executive Mark Schneider 14 months into his tenure at the helm of the world's biggest packaged food company as it struggles to recover from a sixth straight year of slowing growth.
""He has moved a lot of things, and the board is happy with that,"" Chairman Paul Bulcke told Reuters, in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Sao Paulo late on Wednesday. He said the choice of Schneider, a German who moved to Switzerland to become Nestle's first external leader in nearly a century, was the right one.
""His first year was very good, he's a man of action, he sees the need of change,"" Bulcke said, adding that Schneider is also acting in a ""balanced way.""
Since Schneider took the job, he has sold Nestle's confectionery business in the United States, closed high-cost factories in Europe and focused on expansion into consumer health and high growth businesses, with the acquisition of vitamin maker Atrium Innovations.
Schneider reckons the Swiss group, which like other multinational food companies is grappling with slowing growth and greater competition, could buy and sell brands accounting for as much as 10 percent of its sales.
Bulcke said the board expects Schneider to stay as CEO for the long term, saying the company did not want ""a CEO to stay for two or three years."" 
Bulcke declined to comment on meetings with billionaire hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb, saying that Nestle ""respects investors' opinions."" Loeb's hedge fund, Third Point, made a $3.5 billion investment in Nestle last June.
""He has strong opinions, but many of his suggestions are already in our program anyway,"" Bulcke said. Third Point has demanded that Nestle move faster to overhaul its strategy and sell assets such as its stake in beauty business L'Oreal.
Nestl√© is starting to see a recovery in Brazilian consumption after its harshest recession in decades, Bulcke said.

Brazil, where the food processing giant has more than 30 factories, is Nestle's fourth largest market, after the United States, China and France. Bulcke said Nestle plans to continue investing in expansion in the country.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York hedge fund manager on Thursday pleaded guilty to federal charges that he defrauded investors through a nearly $22 million Ponzi scheme.
Michael Scronic, 46, entered his plea to one count of securities fraud before U.S. District Judge Catherine Seibel in White Plains, New York, federal prosecutors announced.
A lawyer for Scronic, Rachel Martin, declined to comment.
Prosecutors said Scronic, of Pound Ridge, New York, sent investors in his Scronic Macro Fund bogus account statements from 2010 to 2017 showing large positive returns. In fact, they said, he lost or spent all but about $27,000 of the $21.8 million he told investors the fund had.
Prosecutors said Scronic spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on himself while managing the fund, including on rent, fees for beach and country club memberships, and mortgage payments for a vacation home near Stratton Mountain in Vermont.
Scronic used new money to repay earlier investors, but began refusing to honor some investors‚Äô redemption requests when money became tight in the summer of 2017.
They said Scronic blamed a vacation, a relative‚Äôs medical condition, email issues, and a new quarterly redemption policy for refusing one investor‚Äôs Aug. 8 redemption request, despite having earlier promised that investor ""quick and painless"" redemptions on demand.
Scronic worked for  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) from 1998 to 2005, including on an equities trading desk, and has degrees from Stanford University and the University of Chicago, according to court papers. Morgan Stanley was not accused of wrongdoing in the case.
Scronic also faces related civil claims from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

China‚Äôs portfolio of U.S. bonds, notes and bills sank to $1.17 trillion in January from $1.18 trillion a month earlier, according to Treasury Department data released Thursday. China remains the largest foreign creditor to the U.S., followed by Japan, whose holdings rose for the first month since July, to $1.07 trillion from $1.06 trillion.
Overall, foreign ownership of Treasuries receded in January for a third straight month, falling to $6.26 trillion, after reaching a record-high $6.32 trillion in October.
The U.S. bond market, the world‚Äôs biggest, endured its worst January since 2009 amid investor fears that inflation could force the Federal Reserve to more aggressively hike rates. Recent reports on wages and consumer prices have lessened those concerns. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index dropped 3.4 percent in January.
Chinese investment in the U.S. has been getting more attention than usual since President Donald Trump took office and pressed ahead with his protectionist agenda. The president this month announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, a move intended to stop China from flooding the market at cut-rate prices. Trump has also threatened a host of trade penalties in response to China‚Äôs alleged theft of intellectual property.
Debt Tool
Threats by Trump to crack down on trade with China have sparked concerns that the Asian nation could use American debt as a tool for retaliation. In January, Chinese officials said that as part of a foreign-exchange review, the government is considering slowing or halting purchases of U.S. Treasuries as they became less attractive relative to other assets.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last month said he isn‚Äôt concerned about foreign investment in new U.S. debt, which analysts expect will exceed $1 trillion this year.
Net foreign purchases of U.S. equities totaled $34.5 billion in January, the most in more than a decade and up from $31.8 billion a month earlier. The 2017 U.S. stock market rally extended into January. After an equities sell-off in February, the S&P 500 Index has recouped more than half its losses.
Among all foreign holders, total net sales of U.S. corporate bonds were $2.2 billion, compared with $1.3 billion in sales a month earlier, according to the Treasury data.

650,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 04:59PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch ,"Investing.com ‚Äì Here‚Äôs a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. Housing, Labor Market, Sentiment Data to Help Dollar Notch Third-Weekly Win?
Building permits, housing starts, labor market data and a raft of University of Michigan data due Friday will round off the week of US economic data as investors slowly turn attention to the Federal reserve meeting next week.
The Commerce Department is expected report building permits fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.320 million units, while housing starts are expected to show decline of 6% to 1.290 million units.
The University of Michigan‚Äôs consumer sentiment index, is expected to show consumer confidence in the economy remained steady, as economist forecast the index to show a reading of 99.3 for March compared to 99.7 in the previous month.
The index serves a barometer of consumer confidence in the economy; a rising sentiment index points to signs of an uptick in increased consumer spending and thus economic growth.
Michigan‚Äôs consumer expectations are expected to show a reading of 89.8 for March, while current conditions are forecast to show a reading of 114.5 in March from 114.9 in the previous month.
The U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTs) report, is expected to show job openings in January rose to about 8.89 million adding to the narrative of strong U.S. labor market
The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback‚Äôs strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, rose by 0.43% to 90.14
2. All Time Highs Coming ‚ÄòSoon‚Äô To U.S. Markets 
JPMorgan‚Äôs Marko Kolanovic bullish claim that ‚Äúmarkets are likely to reach all-time highs soon,‚Äù added to positive sentiment on US stocks late Thursday. 
Kolanovic said market have rebounded from a the deluge of negative headwinds - inflation, stagflation, large deficits ‚Äì while insisting the risk of a potential trade war with China, is ‚Äúvery low.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe argue below that this risk is also very low, and if we take the 2015 turmoil as a template for flows from systematic and fundamental investors, markets are likely to reach all-time highs soon,‚Äù Kolanovic said.
Supporting Kolanovic‚Äôs view that fears over a global trade war are somewhat overdone, white House National Trade Council, Peter Navarro said Thursday the U.S. can Institute tariffs without causing a global trade war.
The Dow Jones notched more than 100 points to close at 24,873.66.
3. Baker Hughes Rig Count In Focus
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US fell for the first time in seven weeks.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.
Also likely to be in focus was a report late Thursday raising the prospect of oil supply disruptions in the Middle East after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly told his security cabinet he expects that President Trump will most likely withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal in May.
If Trump does scrap the deal, the prospect of a tick higher in supplies would increase as it could lead to re-imposition of secondary sanctions on Iran, pressuring countries to reduce their purchases of Iranian crude.
Crude futures settled higher on Thursday after the International Energy Agency warned that further declines in Venezuelan crude supply ‚Äúcould be the final element that tips the market decisively into deficit.‚Äù"
651,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 09:07PM ET</span>","Meredith moves to sell Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated titles: sources","By Jessica Toonkel and Liana B. Baker
(Reuters) - U.S. media company Meredith Corp has hired advisers to explore a sale of its Time, Fortune, Money and Sports Illustrated magazines following its $1.84 billion acquisition of Time Inc in January, people familiar with the matter said.
The move illustrates how Meredith sees some of Time Inc's titles that attract primarily male readership as not playing to its core strength in women's magazines, which include Better Homes & Gardens, Family Circle and Martha Stewart Living.
The Des Moines, Iowa-based company has tapped investment banks  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) and Houlihan Lokey Inc to find potential buyers for the magazines, the sources said this week. There is no certainty that a divestiture will occur, the sources added.
While it's possible that media, telecommunications or technology companies could express an interest in the magazines, a sale to wealthy individuals, such as philanthropists or billionaires, is viewed by Meredith as more likely, according to one of the sources.
The sources asked not to be identified because details of the sale process are confidential. Citigroup declined to comment, while Houlihan Lokey did not immediately return a request for comment.
""We are in fact exploring a number of additional changes to the (magazine) portfolio, including divestitures of brands and businesses that might perform better under a different owner,"" Meredith CEO Steven Lacy told investors at a  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) conference earlier this month.
Time Inc referred calls to Meredith, which declined to comment beyond reiterating that the company is reviewing its portfolio. 
It was not clear how much the magazines could be worth. Fortune and Money generated more than $20 million in 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBIDTA), while Time generated more than $30 million in 12-month EBITDA, according to one of the people. 
The potential divestitures underscore how Time Inc's primary attraction for Meredith was building scale in digital advertising. With its roots in traditional publishing, Meredith has been in a fierce competitive online race against internet giants such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc‚Äôs Google and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) for consumer eyeballs and advertising dollars.
The deal with Time Inc expanded Meredith's reach with internet-savvy millennials, creating a digital media business with 170 million monthly unique visitors in the United States and more than 10 billion annual video views.
Meredith's acquisition of Time Inc was aided by a $650 million investment from the private equity arm of Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers known for championing conservative political causes.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 08:18PM ET</span>","Deutsche Post's DHL expands U.S. delivery service in swipe at FedEx, UPS","By Alexandria Sage and Eric M. Johnson
SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE (Reuters) -  Deutsche Post  (DE:DPWGn) AG's DHL said on Thursday it was launching a delivery service for online retailers in eight U.S. cities, as the German logistics company takes a swipe at dominant players UPS and FedEx (NYSE:FDX). 
Through DHL eCommerce's Parcel Metro service, first reported by Reuters, contractors will make same-day or next-day deliveries from retailers and fulfillment centers directly to homes, the company said. 
""This sector (e-commerce) offers a tremendous amount of opportunity to the logistics space,"" DHL eCommerce Americas Chief Executive Officer Lee Spratt said when announcing the service at an event in San Francisco. 
Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said she believes Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is working with DHL to expand its presence in the United States.
""Amazon is growing 35+ percent per year, and they need to figure out a way to get stuff to the buyers. FedEx and UPS have told Amazon they won't scale with them, meaning that Amazon has to figure out a way to support their delivery network themselves,"" Becker said.
""It also helps that DHL's U.S. hub is in Cincinnati and that is where Amazon is building their air hub. We don't think that's a coincidence,"" she added. 
DHL eCommerce Chief Executive Charles Brewer told Reuters Amazon is a large customer but Parcel Metro was not designed with Amazon in mind. 
Amazon and FedEx did not immediately respond to requests for comment. UPS said it does not comment on competitor business strategies.
DHL has been testing Parcel Metro in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York for the last two years, the company said. It will roll out in Dallas, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. by end-2018 and look to add other global cities in the years ahead, it said.
Parcel Metro relies on third-party contract couriers and app-based driver pools to pick up products like books, shoes, shampoo, and electronics from retailers or warehouses and deliver the items directly to households, Spratt said. 
Parcel Metro will offer delivery windows ranging from two hours, to same-day, and next day, and could add a Saturday delivery option, Spratt said. 
For less-urgent e-commerce orders, DHL will continue its years-long practice of handing off packages to the U.S. Postal Service for ""final-mile"" delivery, it said.
DHL's move is a gamble. The company lost billions of dollars on a failed U.S. expansion a decade ago. https://tinyurl.com/y9wu42dt
Parcel Metro follows DHL's plans, announced in summer 2016, to spend $137 million on seven new or expanded e-commerce fulfillment centers in the United States, where DHL currently delivers roughly 500 million pieces annually.

By comparison, UPS delivered 750 million packages during last year's holiday season alone.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 05:46PM ET</span>",Wells Fargo CEO defends pay; calls Senator Warren's criticism 'inappropriate',"By Steve Friess
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) Chief Executive Tim Sloan on Thursday defended a 35 percent gain in his latest compensation package, while describing comments last year by Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who had called for his ouster, as ""inappropriate."" 
The third-largest U.S. lender has been battling a sales practices scandal that erupted in September 2016 with the revelation employees had opened potentially millions of phony accounts in customers' names. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not surprising I disagree with almost everything Elizabeth Warren says. Most of her comments are both ill-informed and inappropriate,"" Sloan told reporters after speaking to the Detroit Economic Club.
Warren, long a consumer advocate, in October told Sloan she did not believe the bank would be able to change with him in charge, in remarks during his testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
Warren's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sloan's remarks.
Sloan, who took over when former CEO John Stumpf abruptly departed in October 2016, said in January that Wells Fargo was not certain it had fully uncovered and fixed all scandal-related issues.
Internal reviews and regulatory probes have revealed problems in other areas beyond the initial unauthorized accounts, including mortgage lending and auto insurance. 
Earlier this month Wells Fargo said it was examining its wealth and investment management business for possible issues.
In the question-and-answer session with reporters, Sloan noted that the increase in his 2017 compensation from a year earlier in part reflected that he had been in the role for an entire year. 
Regulatory filings on Wednesday showed Sloan's pay rose 35 percent from the previous year, even though he had opted out of an annual incentive plan. 
""I went to the board and said that I don‚Äôt believe that it would be appropriate if I were paid a bonus for the year because we haven‚Äôt made enough progress in terms of advancing,"" he said on Thursday. 
He also said that the bank's scandal-related issues have not resulted in any net loss of retail customers. 
""We‚Äôve had certain customers on the retail side that have left, but the net number of customers during this entire period continues to grow,"" he said. 
The Federal Reserve in February imposed a cap on the lender's balance sheet until it improves governance, and Wells pledged a refresh of its board.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that U.S. regulators are preparing to sanction the bank for receiving commissions on auto insurance policies it helped force on drivers.

McDonald‚Äôs Corp. shares have recovered all of their losses and then some since a selloff triggered by a more pessimistic sales outlook from RBC Capital. The shares fell 4.8 percent on March 2, the biggest one-day slump in eight years, as analyst David Palmer cut his comparable sales estimates, citing a disappointing consumer response to the latest $1 $2 $3 value promotion. They have risen every day since then, regaining about 9 percent.
The rebound, which has beaten the S&P 15 Restaurant Index‚Äôs 5 percent gain during the same period, comes as some analysts speak out in defense of the stock.
Andrew Strelzik at BMO Capital Markets told clients this week that the recent selloff offers ‚Äúan opportunity to capitalize on overreaction to likely temporary issues,‚Äù as sales weakness is expected to be short-lived. He rates McDonald‚Äôs outperform and has a $190 price target.
Bernstein‚Äôs Sara Senatore also defended the burger chain, blaming any potential soft start to the year ‚Äúas a function of MCD‚Äôs determination not to lap last year‚Äôs aggressive local value promotions with equally compelling offers, and therefore something that could be course-corrected should the company so choose.‚Äù She rates the stock outperform with a $195 price target.
Even Palmer, who maintained his outperform rating when he lowered his sales forecast earlier this month, had some positive things to say after the company‚Äôs presentation at a BofAML conference Wednesday, telling clients in a note that he‚Äôs hearing of ‚Äúsignificantly improving sales trends in March in several areas of the country.‚Äù
Palmer, whose $170 price target for the shares is among the lowest, also viewed positively the company‚Äôs introduction of a breakfast value menu, 2 for $4 any breakfast sandwich nationally, and said he believes premium items could be a ‚Äúpotential win‚Äù for McDonald‚Äôs in the second quarter.
In all, McDonald‚Äôs has 23 buy ratings, 12 holds and no sell recommendations. The average price target of $188 implies a 17 percent gain over the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg."

668,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 06:37PM ET</span>","Whistleblower says Walmart, eyeing Amazon, cheated on e-commerce","By Jonathan Stempel and Nandita Bose
(Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) was sued on Thursday by a former executive who accused the world's largest retailer of issuing misleading e-commerce results, amid growing pressure from Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), and firing him for complaining about it.
Tri Huynh, a former director of business development, accused Walmart of having betrayed the principles of integrity and honesty espoused by founder Sam Walton in its push to show ""meteoric growth"" in e-commerce.
The complaint alleges various wrongdoing, including the mislabeling of products, enabling Walmart to charge excessive sales commissions, and failure to properly process customer returns, enabling it to boost results.
""Wal-Mart cut corners and cheated in a race to expand and gain market-share,"" having been ""desperate to gain the ground it had long lost to Amazon,"" Huynh said in his complaint filed in U.S. District Court in San Francisco.
Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the litigation is based on allegations by a disgruntled former employee, who was let go when the business was restructured.
""We take allegations like this seriously and looked into them when they were brought to our attention,"" he said. ""The investigation found nothing to suggest that the company acted improperly.""
Walmart will vigorously defend itself against the claims, Hargrove added.
The retailer's shares closed down 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $87.51, after earlier falling as much as 2 percent.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has spent billions of dollars in recent years to compete with Amazon, including through its 2016 purchase of Jet.com, and last month said quarterly online sales, including the December holidays, had risen 23 percent.
But Amazon's sales in North America grew 40 percent in the same quarter, and analysts have said its price war has weighed on Walmart's margins.
Huynh accused Walmart of charging higher sales commissions from sellers on its online marketplace, where third-party sellers list and sell products, with commissions rising as high as 15 percent compared with the normal 6 percent to 8 percent.
Walmart's internal controls allegedly failed to detect the problem, causing the retailer to overstate revenue. 
Huynh also said Walmart failed to process more than $7 million of customer returns, inflating the total value of merchandise sold from September 2015 to March 2016.
The plaintiff, who was born in Vietnam and lives in Washington state, said Walmart abruptly fired him in January 2017 in retaliation for his repeated complaints about its e-commerce reporting and internal controls.
Huynh said he was fired not long after raising concerns with U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore, and was dismissed under the ""false pretenses"" of a broader workforce reduction and alleged performance issues.
He said he had told human resources the prior May of his efforts to deal with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
""Wal-Mart sacrificed and betrayed its Founder's key principles of integrity and honesty, pushing those core values aside in its rush to win the E-commerce war at all costs,"" Huynh said. ""In doing this, it realized it must silence any whistleblower who spoke up.""
The lawsuit, which accuses Walmart of violating the federal Sarbanes-Oxley whistleblower law and various California state laws, seeks punitive and other damages.

The case is Huynh v Wal-Mart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 18-01631.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 04:00PM ET</span>","Ford will speed shift to SUVs to boost profit, shares","By Paul Lienert and Joseph White
DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) executives on Thursday disclosed ambitious plans to shift the struggling automaker's product portfolio from passenger cars to SUVs, add more hybrid and pure electric vehicles, and reduce development and manufacturing costs - moves aimed at boosting Ford's profit and share price.
At a media briefing near the company's headquarters, Chief Executive Jim Hackett said Ford's previously stated margin target of 8 percent ""now has upside."" But company executives targeted 2020 as when the overhaul of its product lineup and engineering systems will fully take hold.
Ford shares were up 0.8 percent at $11.11 on Thursday afternoon, reversing an earlier decline. 
Ford is overhauling itself for the second time in a decade at a time when rivals, including General Motors Co (N:GM), are telling investors they are ready now to move aggressively into new, technology-driven markets such as robo-taxi services and electric vehicles. GM said on Thursday it will invest $100 million in two suburban Detroit factories to begin commercial production of self-driving versions of Chevrolet Bolt electric cars for use as robo-taxis.
Jim Farley, Ford's president of global markets, said the automaker plans to shift $7 billion of investment to sport utility vehicles from cars, and by 2020 field a North American lineup of eight SUVs, including one high-performance electric model and five with hybrid powertrains.
Trucks already are critical to Ford. The F-series pickup line generated $41 billion in revenue last year - about 28 percent of Ford's total $145.7 billion in revenue - but the lion's share of the company's profit. 
Coming out of the 2008 financial crisis, Ford pushed fuel-efficient cars for the U.S. market. Now, the automaker is driving toward a near-term future in which cars account for only 14 percent of its volume, with SUVs and trucks growing to around 86 percent of North American sales. Of nine future vehicles displayed at Ford's product development center on Thursday, only one was a car - a high-performance Mustang.
Among new SUVs in the pipeline are two boxy models aimed at  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV's (MI:FCHA) profitable Jeep franchise. 
Ford also plans to take on Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) with a performance-oriented battery electric utility vehicle in 2020 - the first of six new pure electric vehicles due by 2022 as part of Ford's planned $11 billion investment in electrification. ""That vehicle is going to be famous without having to shoot it up in space,"" Farley said, alluding to the roadster Tesla CEO Elon Musk launched recently with one of his SpaceX rockets.
Ford will move the Lincoln brand's focus toward SUVs and electrified cars. Lincoln ""is committing to electrification across its lineup globally,"" with new hybrid electric versions of its future models, Farley said. In the push to increase revenue from commercial customers, Ford will update its F-series Super duty pickups, launch the Ranger compact pickup and overhaul its large Transit van in 2019.
Phoenix dealer Tim Hovik said in an interview on Thursday he was ""excited"" by the prospect of the performance electric vehicle in 2020, but that the upcoming Bronco SUV was generating the greatest interest among his customers. 
He also said ""there will be demand"" for a rumored Raptor performance edition of the new Ranger compact pickup as a companion to the larger F-150 Raptor: ""We're out here in the wild, wild west. The days' supply of F-series Raptors is about six hours."" Joe Hinrichs, president of global operations, said Ford is cutting costs by reducing the time to develop new models by 20 per cent, and by relying on just five new flexible vehicle architectures. 
Ford's new model preview is part of a broader effort to regain investor confidence after a turbulent year. 
Ford shares have lagged those of rival General Motors Co (N:GM) since Hackett was named CEO on May 22, 2017. Since then, Ford shares peaked at $13.23 in mid-January, then plunged to$10.14 in early March and have only recently begun to recover. 

GM stock has risen more than 14 percent during the same period. Its shares were up 0.5 percent at $37.89 on Thursday afternoon.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said on Thursday a trial to decide if AT&T's (N:T) $85 billion acquisition of  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX) is legal under U.S. antitrust law may last six to eight weeks, significantly longer than previously forecast.
At a pre-trial hearing, Leon said he will hear up to two days of motions before hearing opening arguments on Wednesday.
Lawyers for the government and both companies did not comment on Leon's estimate on the length of the trial; they had previously suggested it would last three weeks.
The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV and other products with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN, among many other channels, saying it could raise prices for rivals and pay-TV subscribers while hampering the development of online video.
The judge will hear arguments on a number of objections including whether some emails can be introduced as evidence and how to handle potentially confidential information during the trial.
Shares of AT&T closed nearly unchanged at $37.04, while Time Warner closed up 0.5 percent to $96.88.
Leon warned reporters not to use electronic devices and said they could be banned from the courtroom and held in contempt of court if they violated the prohibition. 
He also discouraged the government and companies from attempting to try the case in the press, saying his goal was to ensure both sides receive a fair trial. ""The case will be tried in this room,"" Leon said.

After the hearing, Leon told both sides to ""Get your rest"" before the start of a lengthy trial.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 01:50PM ET</span>",Goldman Sachs sees reshaping of industries driving M&A,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Liana B. Baker
NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Major shifts in industries ranging from semiconductors and food to beverages and pharmaceuticals will keep fueling the blistering pace of mergers and acquisitions, one of  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) Inc's top dealmakers said on Thursday.
Gradually rising interest rates, stock market jitters amid concerns over U.S. trade policy, and new concerns about U.S. regulators moving to thwart mergers have raised questions on Wall Street on whether robust dealmaking activity will continue.
However, most transformative mergers and acquisitions are driven by industries that were static for several years and are now in the process of adjusting to changes ranging from the introduction of new technologies to demographic shifts, Goldman Sachs global M&A co-head Michael Carr told the Tulane Corporate Law Institute conference in New Orleans on Thursday.
""We are in an environment where entire industries are changing structure and that's causing M&A to happen... Transactions beget transactions. Sometimes you need to do something because your neighbor did it, "" Carr said.
Semiconductor company managers, for example, have recognized they are in a race to gain scale, saying to themselves and rivals: ""I'm either in this game or I'm a seller,"" said Carr.
U.S. merger and acquisition volumes reached $389 billion so far this year, compared with $236.5 billion in the same period a year ago, as more mega deals were announced, according to Thomson Reuters data, including U.S. health insurer Cigna (NYSE:CI) Corp's $52 billion agreement to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co and Keurig Green Mountain's more than $21 billion deal to combine with soda maker  Dr Pepper Snapple  Group Inc (NYSE:DPS).
Given the strategic reasons companies are exploring mergers, Carr downplayed the risk of rising debt financing costs and soaring corporate valuations weighing on M&A activity. However, he acknowledged that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has increased regulatory uncertainty for deals, especially those involving China.
""The relationship between the White house and Beijing is far from great,"" Carr said. 
With the Trump administration's tax reform set, companies will have more cash to put to work. The U.S. corporate tax rate was cut to 21 percent from 35 percent at the start of the year. Also, billions of dollars will be brought back to the United States now that companies face a one-time tax on profits stock piled abroad.

""Right now this feels like a bit of a juggernaut... this is going to continue until people do stupid deals,"" Carr said.

Shares of Monsanto fell 4 percent in heavy afternoon trading following the news.
The U.S. Department of Justice wants Bayer to divest more assets to satisfy its conditions, and does not think the German chemicals company's current proposal is sufficient, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
Monsanto spokeswoman Sara Miller declined to comment. A Bayer spokesman said the company would not comment on rumors, but added it remains in talks with regulators to help close the deal in the second quarter of the year.
Bayer had pledged to sell certain seed and herbicide assets for 5.9 billion euros ($7.26 billion) to BASF to address EU regulatory concerns and has separately offered to sell its vegetable seeds business to BASF. [nL5N1QP3ET]
The company has secured an approval from Brazilian regulators for the merger, while it is in the frame to win conditional antitrust approval from the European Union, Reuters reported this week. [nL3N1QV4EG]

DAKAR (Reuters) - In an ornate room in Democratic Republic of Congo's presidential palace last week, some of global mining's most powerful men faced off against government officials over proposed changes to the country's mining code. 
Facing the officials, including President Joseph Kabila, the executives at times threatened to pursue arbitration or close mines if the government went ahead with changes including royalty increases, according to one of the president's top advisers, Barnabe Kikaya bin Karubi, who attended the meeting. 
But there was no mistaking the sense of defeat as executives from  Glencore  (L:GLEN), Randgold (L:RRS), Ivanhoe (TO:IVN) and other firms descended the red carpeted stairs after six hours to accept before the media a mining code that hikes taxes and removes exemptions for cobalt and other minerals. 
It was an extraordinary climb down for companies that had campaigned tooth-and-nail for six years for better terms, and the president signed the bill into law two days later.
Congolese officials close to the process say that, in being so publicly combative, the miners overplayed their hand, and in so doing hardened the government's resolve. ""We realised the bad faith on their part,"" said Patrick Kakwata, president of the National Assembly's Natural Resources Commission, which oversees mining legislation.
""They only wanted to look after their own interests and not also the interests of the Congolese people.""
The changes to the mining code in Congo, which supplies some 60 percent of the world's cobalt, could have repercussions for consumers around the world if mining companies pass on costs.
Cobalt is a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries that power smartphones and electric cars. Rising demand for those products has caused cobalt prices to more than triple in the last two years.
The Congolese government's success in facing down the companies' lobbying could also signal a shift in the balance of power as countries sitting on increasingly lucrative resources become emboldened. 
Congo's effort could serve as a model for other countries looking to boost mining sector revenue, particularly those that can leverage demand for prized metals like cobalt.
TEAM DISPATCHED
Meeting participants Glencore, Randgold, Zijin (SS:601899), China Molybdenum (SS:603993) and Ivanhoe declined to comment for this story. The other participant, MMG, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Early last month, Randgold publicly threatened to challenge the new code through international arbitration if Kabila did not return it to the mines ministry for further consultation with industry.
And, in December, several of Congo's largest mining companies said in a statement that an earlier version of the code passed by the lower house of parliament would ""cause the certain death of a young industry"".
On Thursday, the mining companies said in a statement they had dispatched a team of legal and technical specialists to Kinshasa for talks with the Congolese government about drafting measures to implement the code.
The companies said they hoped those discussions would include negotiations over royalties and taxes as well as recognition of the previous code's stability clause.
Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu, however, said after last week's meeting that nothing agreed to in the follow-up negotiations could contradict the terms of the new code.
The new mining code strips away a stability clause protecting existing investments from changes to the fiscal and customs regime for 10 years, opens the door for cobalt royalties to increase five-fold and introduces a 50 percent windfall profits tax.
The new code applies to all minerals, including copper, of which Congo is Africa's top producer.
Companies could still challenge it through international arbitration. It is also unclear how rigorously the code will be enforced in a country where informal arrangements often supersede legal provisions.
In a joint statement issued by the Congo government and the mining executives directly after the meeting, the miners said they had received assurances from Kabila ""that their concerns will be taken into account through a constructive dialogue with the government after the promulgation of the new mining law"".
""SUCKERED"" 
Private investors have poured money into Congo since Kabila signed the 2002 mining code at the tail end of a 1998-2003 war. But locals have seen few benefits. Congo remains one of the world's least developed countries, plagued by corruption and poor governance.
In March 2015, the government submitted a bill to parliament that proposed raising royalties to levels higher than in the 2002 code but still lower than in most rival mining countries.
Mining companies resisted, saying that proposed changes to the code would ""put the future of the country's mining industry at grave risk"" and urged the government to retain the 2002 code.
Following a steep drop in commodities prices, Congo's government buckled to industry pressure and announced in March 2016 it was suspending consideration of the new code.
But as the commodity slump bit into the national economy last year - stretching foreign reserves to breaking point and pushing inflation to 47 percent - the government needed cash.
Parliament toughened up the code at the start of this year.
Protections under the previous code's stability clause were axed entirely. A 10 percent royalty was introduced on ""strategic substances"", which the prime minister's office said this week would include cobalt and possibly copper.
Companies were also mandated to repatriate 60 percent of export revenues to Congo, up from 40 percent in earlier drafts.
Lawmakers involved in the negotiations did not provide clear explanations for how these last-minute changes came about, but two of them said that they had grown inured to doomsday warnings from miners about the code killing investment.
""There is this contradiction that emerges each time ... when the miners declare losses (in Congo) when their mother company is only enjoying success,"" said Alain Lubamba, an MP closely involved in the revision process.
""This means that we're being suckered.""
Mining companies in Congo typically say that the high risk and cost of investing in the vast country with poor infrastructure hit profitability, justifying demands for favorable terms.
TENSE TALKS
Randgold, based in Jersey in the English Channel, formed a new lobbying platform with Glencore and others and requested an audience with Kabila.
The president accepted a meeting with top executives from six mining companies, but insisted they come to Kinshasa in person; no stand-ins would be admitted.
After a last-minute postponement by a day, the meeting finally began at around 2:30 p.m. last Wednesday with Kabila presiding.
Randgold CEO Mark Bristow, the miners' designated spokesperson, started by laying out their main concerns and imploring Kabila to re-open negotiations. The other executives chimed in from time-to-time, according to Kikaya, the Kabila adviser.
""For three hours, they were very confrontational and they were talking in terms of closing down the mines,"" Kikaya said. Bristow couldn‚Äôt be reached for comment.
Kabila interjected occasionally, Kikaya said, urging the miners not to pursue arbitration.
""The president explained that this would be bad for everyone. He said, 'Look you are a businessman. If you make a mistake, you lose money. I am a politician',"" Kikaya said.
A breakthrough appeared to come after Kabwelulu, the mines minister, promised the miners that their concerns would be addressed on a case-by-case basis in regulations to be hammered out after the code was signed, according to Kikaya.

Kabila then exited the room, leaving his advisers and the executives to figure out how to break the news.

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's favorite ice cream company has kicked up a legal storm over the ""Blizzard.""
American Dairy Queen, whose Blizzard has long been one of its most popular products, sued W.B. Mason Co in federal court this week to stop the office supplies distributor from selling bottled spring water also bearing the Blizzard name.
Dairy Queen's Blizzard contains soft-serve ice cream that can be blended with fruit, nuts, M&Ms, Oreos and other mix-ins.
W.B. Mason has fought back, and on Thursday filed its own federal lawsuit seeking a declaration that it did not infringe any trademark belonging to Dairy Queen, owned since 1998 by Buffett's conglomerate,  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa).
The litigation is not Dairy Queen's first over the Blizzard name, and follows its 2010 settlement of a lawsuit involving a Southern California frozen yogurt company, Yogubliz.
Dairy Queen began using the Blizzard name in 1946, and has five Blizzard trademarks dating back to 1952. Its current Blizzard has been for sale since 1985.
W.B. Mason, known for the slogan ""Who But W.B. Mason,"" has since 2010 sold Blizzard water, in sizes from 8 ounces to 5 gallons, and has used the name to sell copy paper as early as 2003.
It attracted Dairy Queen's attention last April after submitting trademark applications for Blizzard water.
In its March 12 complaint, Dairy Queen said W.B. Mason's conduct threatens ""irreparable injury"" and has caused a ""likelihood of confusion"" because many of Dairy Queen's 4,500 U.S. locations sell bottled water.
The Edina, Minnesota-based company, which has more than 6,700 locations worldwide, is seeking an injunction against W.B. Mason, plus profits from water sales.
W.B. Mason, based in Brockton, Massachusetts, said it has ""no interest"" in creating confusion, and has created none.
The companies have had ""a long period of what we call co-existence,"" its lawyer, Jason Kravitz, a partner at Nixon Peabody in Boston, said in an interview. ""There has not been to our knowledge a single instance of any consumer being confused by W.B. Mason's sale and promotion of its spring water."" 
Dairy Queen does not discuss pending litigation, spokesman Dean Peters said in an email.
Buffett sometimes visits Dairy Queen in his Omaha, Nebraska, hometown.
Known for eating habits that would give some doctors fits, the 87-year-old billionaire told Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance in 2016 he usually orders a small sundae for the ice cream and an extra large sundae for the topping, and combines them.

The cases are American Dairy Queen Corp v. W.B. Mason Co, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, No. 18-00693; and W.B. Mason Co v American Dairy Queen Corp, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 18-10488.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 12:30PM ET</span>",U.S. trade panel says imports of aluminum foil from China harm U.S. producers,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission said on Thursday it had made a final finding that imports of aluminum foil from China hurt U.S. producers, a move that locks in place hefty duties of up to 188 percent on Chinese exporters.
The ""final phase"" finding came in an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy case brought by the Aluminum Association Trade Enforcement Working Group.
The final finding means the U.S. Commerce Department can put in place for five years antidumping and countervailing duties it announced on Feb. 27 on a number of Chinese firms.
The department announced that dumping margins would range from 48.64 percent to 106.9 percent and anti-subsidy rates from 17.14 percent to 80.97 percent.
The action is separate from U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of a global aluminum tariff of 10 percent and a global steel tariff of 25 percent.
China expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" after the U.S. Commerce Department announced its findings in February, and the country's Ministry of Commerce said it would take steps to protect its legal rights and interests in the matter.

Wang Hejun, the head of the ministry's Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau, said in the statement the U.S. finding ""disregarded WTO rules"" and would seriously damage China's aluminum foil exporters.

Blue Apron pioneered the meal-kit market, selling subscriptions for pre-portioned ingredients paired with recipes for restaurant-style meals like tilapia piccata and miso-glazed barramundi, but has faced new rivals including Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).
Blue Apron said in an emailed statement to Reuters that the new multichannel offering will make the brand more accessible to homes across the country.
The company did not disclose when it would start selling the kits or which stores it was targeting.
Blue Apron Chief Executive Officer Brad Dickerson in an interview with the Wall Street Journal said he believes the company can find more customers for both that model and √†-la-carte meals sold in stores and through its website.
""The access to consumers is much broader in this avenue than the avenue we've been operating in the past,"" he said in an interview to the Journal.
Last week, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc said it would launch meal kits priced between $8 and $15 that would be rolled out to more than 2,000 stores in 2018, sending Blue Apron's shares down as much as 5.8 percent. 

Shares of Blue Apron were up nearly 2 percent in early trading on Thursday.

Online retail sales in the country grew 37% in the first two months of 2018,  NBS reported, up from 32% growth the prior month. Meanwhile, traditional retail sales grew just 9.7% ‚Äî falling just short of the expected 9.8%.
""Taking into consideration normal seasonality pattern, this gives us a higher level of comfort in our Alibaba‚Äôs FY18 GMV growth estimate of c.30% with potential upside,"" Jefferies analyst Karen Chan said in a note to clients Thursday, reiterating her buy rating and $325 price target.
Jefferies is one of the Alibaba's biggest bulls, with a price target 41% above the Wall Street consensus of $230 per share. 
""We believe the strong online retail sales in spite of weak seasonality could be attributed to: 1) a longer-than-usual shopping window prior to Chinese New Year holiday; 2) increased rural consumption spending over CNY from post-80s with smart home electronics and imported fresh goods showing fast growth; 3) step-up in online-offline promotional efforts, e.g. red packets, Taobao-RTmart (SunArt) promotion; 4)  enhanced logistics service for fresh goods, e.g. Hema,"" Chan said.
The Wall Street Journal also reported early Thursday that the company was  seeking to move its stock listing home to mainland China, citing people familiar with the matter. Alibaba has traded on the New York Stock Exchange ever since it went public in 2014 in  the world's largest IPO.
Shares of Alibaba are up 4% in early trading Thursday and 85% in the past year."

Unlike previous market corrections, when developing nations suffered big outflows, clients have been adding more money to the riskiest assets, said Sheila Patel, the chief executive officer of International GSAM. That‚Äôs been a sound strategy during the past month as emerging-market stocks returned 3.1 percent, beating the 2.5 percent gain for U.S. peers.
‚ÄúIt would be hard to find a time when you‚Äôve felt more sanguine about the way things are,‚Äù she said in an interview at Bloomberg‚Äôs headquarters in New York. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean we should relax, because there are things to make one nervous, but they tend to be about the structure of the markets.‚Äù
 Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).‚Äôs asset-management arm, which manages more than $1 trillion, joins GMO, Voya Investment Management and JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). in touting emerging markets to clients after the benchmark stock index surged more than 75 percent since early 2016. Bulls argue that developing-nation stocks are supported by earnings growth, cheap historical valuations and lower volatility than their more industrialized peers.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index was little changed as of 9:31 a.m. New York time.
Patel says the firm is particularly positive on Indian healthcare firms, Mexican consumer stocks and Argentine debt. She expects India‚Äôs government will boost spending on public health under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And although political risks can‚Äôt be ignored, investors‚Äô pessimism toward Mexico and Argentina is overdone, she said.
Here‚Äôs what else Patel had to say about emerging markets:
Nafta talks and opportunities
‚ÄúWe are hopeful still some of this is about posturing and about micro-level negotiations rather than a full-on breakdown of Nafta. If you come at it with that backdrop and you look at Mexico, we see again, in the context of this more benign global economic environment, them as a beneficiary with the continuing support for middle class. And if that‚Äôs the case, then you have good opportunities with some of the consumer stocks. And with people‚Äôs concern over Nafta, you may have occasional interesting buying opportunities.‚Äù
‚ÄòQuite a bit of excitement‚Äô on Saudi Arabia
‚ÄúOne of the places we‚Äôre spending time on that will likely be investable soon is Saudi. I think Saudi Arabia is definitely another location where given the likely MSCI inclusion and given again a very favorable demographic, there‚Äôs quite a bit of excitement among our clients to understand what opportunities might exist in terms of that market as it opens.‚Äù
Ramaphosa and South Africa‚Äôs trajectory
‚ÄúWe are cheered by the new president and we had been very reticent during this recent period of instability. I would say that when we look at South Africa, it‚Äôs that instability that‚Äôs kind of gated us from being too overly committed when we watch. I think we‚Äôre still a little slow-watching, but it gives us a basis for renewed analysis. We‚Äôre sort of opening the books again and saying time to look at it again, but we haven‚Äôt really made a strong move on that yet.‚Äù
Vietnam has ‚Äòsome really interesting opportunities‚Äô
""The add-on or the knock-on activity that comes from places like China is a real opportunity. As manufacturing has gotten more expensive in China, we‚Äôve seen some really interesting opportunities in places like Vietnam. I don‚Äôt think maybe 10 years ago anybody would say Vietnam‚Äôs an opportunity because they‚Äôre a supplier to the Chinese consumer. Probably people would have thought that was crazy and today I think it‚Äôs a key investing theme.""

735,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 11:23AM ET</span>","Exclusive: HSBC has 59 percent gender pay gap, biggest among British banks","By Karin Strohecker and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - HSBC (L:HSBA) will reveal a gender pay gap of 59 percent at its main UK banking operation, the biggest yet disclosed by a British bank, according to a copy of the lender's report on the subject seen by Reuters on Thursday ahead of its publication.
The bank will also disclose a mean gender bonus gap of 86 percent at HSBC Bank Plc, which is the biggest of the lender's seven entities in Britain and employs 23,507 people. 
A spokeswoman for the bank confirmed the contents of the report.
The gender pay gap is the biggest yet reported by a British financial firm, according to government data, with some firms yet to provide figures ahead of an April deadline set by Prime Minister Theresa May last year.
Almost 50 years since the passage of Britain's equal pay act, the continued gulf in earnings between men and women has attracted significant public attention over the past year or so.
In common with other banks, HSBC said its pay gap was largely accounted for by the bank having fewer women in senior roles.
The gender pay gap measures the difference between the average salary of men and women, calculated on an hourly basis.
HSBC said women held only 23 percent of senior leadership positions in its workforce in Britain, despite accounting for more than half of total staff.
The bank said it was taking a number of steps to reduce the pay gap, including committing to an aspirational target of women holding 30 percent of senior roles by 2020.
Last month, Asia-focused  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) reported a gap of 30 percent in Britain, while Virgin Money (LON:VM) - the only major UK lender run by a woman - said its female staff earned on average 32.5 percent less per hour than its male workforce.
Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) and Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) reported gender pay gaps of 32.8 percent and 37 percent respectively.
 Barclays  (LON:BARC) said last month it paid women in its international division, which houses its investment bank, on average 48 percent of what men earned in fixed pay.

The pay gaps have drawn criticism from lawmakers and are likely to spur questions from investors in the upcoming season for shareholder meetings, with stock prices and future earnings potential strongly linked to banks' efforts to revive their reputations in the wake of the global financial crisis.

(Reuters) - Toy retailer Toys 'R' Us Inc on Thursday asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for approval to stop paying all of its suppliers while it tries to line up buyers for its international business ahead of a planned liquidation of its U.S. operations.
The iconic toy store's plan to liquidate inventory and shutter or sell its U.S. stores has put 30,000 jobs at risk and left vendors wondering where to send merchandise stuck on ships and trucks, and whether their invoices will ever get paid, lawyers said at a court hearing on Thursday.
As shoppers flock to Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and children choose smartphones and screens over toys, Toys 'R' Us has struggled to boost sales and service debt following a $6.6-billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms in 2005.
At a hearing at U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Richmond, Virginia, Toys 'R' Us lawyer Joshua Sussberg said the company was working to avoid any contagion from the U.S. liquidation on the foreign businesses it is trying to sell.
Part of that effort means separating the U.S. business from foreign operations to ensure that shipments can reach stores in Canada, Europe and Asia, where the company will be reviewing bid proposals in coming weeks.
But lawyers for vendors said they did not know whether they would ever get paid for those goods. 
Kenneth Eckstein, a lawyer on behalf of the official committee of unsecured creditors, called the precipitous liquidation ""extremely disappointing and sad,"" noting that hundreds of vendors, thousands of employees and millions of customers will suffer.
""This is the largest and most rapid deterioration of a retailer and maybe that any Chapter 11 has ever entertained,"" he said.

Toys 'R' Us - the last major retailer focusing solely on toys - plans to liquidate inventory at 735 U.S. stores, including Babies 'R' Us locations, by the end of this year. The wind-down follows a bruising holiday season, when the company failed to stay competitive and sales came in well below projections. The quarter accounts for 40 percent of its annual net sales.
With the disappearance of Toys 'R' Us, everything from squishies and slime kits made by small companies, to board games and Barbie dolls by heavyweights  Hasbro Inc  (NASDAQ:HAS) and  Mattel Inc  (NASDAQ:MAT), will lose a top customer.
Hasbro said the pending liquidation and closure is expected to be ""disruptive"" in the near term.
Lutz Muller, president of consultancy Klosters Trading Corp, estimated a single-digit sales impact on companies like Mattel, Hasbro, Spin Master Corp, Jakks Pacific Inc, Funko Inc and MGA Entertainment Inc. 
""Bad but not fatal,"" Muller said. ""But for the little guys that depended on Toys 'R' Us as a major showcase ... a large number will go to the wall.""
Jefferies predicted the bankruptcy would depress 2018 revenue across the industry by between 2.5 percent and 5.5 percent. It said 40 percent of the toy sales up for grabs would flow to Amazon and 30 percent to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc.
Shares of Mattel fell nearly 3 percent while shares of Hasbro were trading slightly lower on Thursday; they had tumbled last week on Toys 'R' Us' liquidation reports. 
Toys 'R' Us' creditors said in a court filing that  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Walmart and Amazon pricing toys at low margins, and a greater-than-expected decline in toy and gift card sales following its bankruptcy filing in September, led to the weak performance in the quarter.
TOYS ABROAD
Wayne, New Jersey-based Toys 'R' Us was already in the process of closing one-fifth of its stores as part of an attempt to emerge from one of the largest ever bankruptcies by a specialty retailer.
In September, when the company operated more than 1,600 stores globally, with roughly 800 stores outside the United States, it got court permission to borrow more than $2 billion to start paying suppliers.
But efforts to keep the business going collapsed after lenders decided they could recover more in a liquidation by closing stores and raising money from merchandise sales.
Seventy-year-old Toys 'R' Us does not rule out a last-minute offer for all of its stores and said it will announce the winning bidder of a March 29 auction on April 12. 
More than 8,000 U.S. retail stores closed in 2017, roughly double the average annual store closures in the previous decade, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Despite the threat of 30,000 job losses, experts do not expect retail employment and wages to be subdued in the near term. Approximately 700,000 jobs in the industry need to be filled, say retail staffing firms and trade federations such as the NRF.

Aly Sanchez, a two-year employee of Toys R Us in Kansas City, said, ""It's an overwhelming feeling not knowing what‚Äôs going to happen. And if we do close, we don't know if we'll even get severance pay.""

The ECB appears ""to have taken into account concerns expressed by the European Parliament,"" Antonio Tajani said in a statement commenting on the ECB's plan released on Thursday.
The Parliament had criticized an earlier version of the ECB plan saying it was beyond the supervisor's mandate.
Tajani said the legislature will further assess the ECB plan and said the ECB's banking oversight should move in line with incoming EU rules on bad loans that were proposed on Wednesday by the EU Commission and will need the approval of EU states and lawmakers
The rules proposed by the Commission differ in some aspects from the ECB guidelines.
Under the commission's legislative proposal, banks will have two years to fully cover unsecured loans and eight years to cover secured debt, while the ECB's guidelines say secured loans should be fully covered in a maximum seven years.
The EU proposals concern only newly granted loans, originated on or after March 14, while the ECB's guidelines involve any loan already on the books and classified as non-performing after April 1.
The ECB softened an earlier version of its guidelines that had led to fierce criticism, especially in Italy, where bad loan burdens are more acute.
It stressed on Thursday that its guidance was not binding and will be applied case-by-case, a move that Tajani said could be seen as addressing some of the concerns raised by the parliament.

In a legal opinion issued in November, the parliament said the ECB had no power to impose guidelines on provisioning to all euro zone banks under its watch because this was the prerogative of EU legislators.

Corbat's annual total compensation was $17.8 million while the median annual total compensation of all Citi employees was $48,249, the bank said in the filing. The bank in February announced that it had raised Corbat's annual compensation by 48 percent for 2017, a year in which the bank made more money from operations but still fell short of earlier targets. 
The change in Corbat's pay compares with annual raises of 5 to 20 percent for other Wall Street bank chief executives.

(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 200 points on Thursday as industrial stocks gained after the White House trade adviser sought to play down chances of a trade war due to protectionist policies.
President Donald Trump's tough approach to global trade, including new tariffs on metals imports, will not necessarily provoke retaliation from trading partners, Peter Navarro, the top adviser on international economic exchanges, said on CNBC.
""It was very destabilizing to the markets that the White House is aware of that and they dialed back the rhetoric to an extent,"" said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York.
Corporates, especially manufacturers, have been under pressure from Trump's tariff plans, including a move to impose duties of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports while pushing for $100 billion cut in trade surplus.
Thursday's gains helped the Dow (DJI) erase much of its losses since Trump announced tariff plans on March 1. The blue-chip index is still trading about 6 percent below its record highs hit on Jan. 26 and was last up 0.82 percent at 24,960.4 points.
""Prices of equities have become modestly more attractive in the recent days as a result of the compression in prices,"" said Kenny.
The S&P industrial index (SPLRCI) rose 0.44 percent and was on course for its first session of gains in four days. 
 General Electric  (N:GE), 3M (N:MMM) and  Caterpillar  (N:CAT) were up more than 1 percent. Boeing (N:BA), which investors say may be particularly vulnerable to a trade war, was marginally up.
The S&P 500 (SPX) pared some of its early gains and was up 0.13 percent at 2,752.97 as energy (SPNY) and material stocks (SPLRCM) weighed. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) fell 0.04 percent to 7,494.06 points.
The markets also found support from economic data that showed weekly jobless claims fell last week, pointing to a strong labor market. 
A bigger-than-expected rise in U.S. import prices in February indicated a steady pick up in inflation.
Among stocks,  Alibaba  (N:BABA) jumped 3.2 percent on report that the Chinese e-commerce giant was planning a secondary listing in China. 
Dollar General (N:DG) rose 3.6 percent after the discount retailer's quarterly same-store sales beat estimates. 
Qorvo (O:QRVO) tumbled 5.9 percent to the bottom of the S&P 500 after Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said the RF chipmaker could lose out to Broadcom (O:AVGO) for a spot in upcoming iPhones.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE for a 1.55-to-1 ratio, and for a 1.13-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has selected Citi, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), HSBC and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) as the main banks that will arrange its next U.S. dollar bond issue, sources familiar with the matter said.
The country is planning to borrow funds in the international debt capital markets soon, in what would be its fourth international public debt issue.
Both Saudi Arabia‚Äôs Debt Management Office and the four banks declined to comment.
Saudi Arabia started raising U.S. dollar debt in 2016 through a $10 billion syndicated loan, as the country‚Äôs finances were squeezed by a slump in oil prices.
After the loan deal, the country started borrowing internationally through jumbo bond issues, establishing itself as the most prominent issuer in the region.
It sold a $17.5 billion bond in 2016 ‚Äì the largest bond ever sold by an emerging market issuer ‚Äì followed by a $9 billion sukuk and a $12.5 billion conventional bond in 2017.
It is not clear whether the upcoming deal will be as large as Saudi‚Äôs previous issues. The head of the Debt Management Office (DMO) said in October last year that the government was considering whether to make a greater number of international bond sales but reduce the size of the transactions.
Saudi Arabia has recently refinanced, extended and upsized its $10 billion loan, bringing the facility up to $16 billion.
The DMO said in January that it had contacted banks requesting proposals to refinance the loan facility, arrange further U.S dollar debt issuance and for additional financing supported by foreign countries‚Äô export credit agencies.
‚ÄúThe bond request for proposal is a continuation of the funding program established by KSA in 2016, and as part of the Kingdom‚Äôs commitment to the international debt market,‚Äù the DMO said at the time.

Demand was so high for a 750 million-euro ($927 million) bond sale from Moscow-based Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) PJSC that the energy giant was able to cut its borrowing costs by knocking about 38 basis points off its yield. Most of the demand for the oversubscribed bond came from continental Europe, but there were also some buyers from the U.K., according to VTB Capital, which helped organize the sale.
A successful sale may give a lift to President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs government as it prepares to come to the market with its own Eurobond before the end of the month.

It marked the first time the union hasn't demanded pay increases and bonuses during annual wage talks, a union official said. 
GM, which last month announced the planned shutdown of one of its factories in South Korea, has proposed a base wage freeze and no bonuses this year as well a suspension of some worker benefits including school tuition for employees' children. 
In exchange for agreeing wage concessions, the union called on GM to detail a roadmap for new models, and distribute stocks worth 30 million won ($28,214)in GM Korea to each worker after swapping the nearly 3 trillion won of debt owed by the Korean unit to its headquarters into equity.
The union also wants an agreement under which GM would not lay off all employees at GM Korea for the next 10 years. 
GM previously said it is looking to the union to ""accept important concessions that can help address a lack of competitiveness in costs and productivity."" 
The U.S. automaker is currently waiting on a final decision by the South Korean government to extend financial support to continue operating in the country.
‚ÄúWe make it clear that we are making concessions and sacrifices with unbearable pain, to protect jobs and survival rights of 300,000 workers,‚Äù the union said in a statement. 
A GM Korea spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
Almost 2,500 workers at GM Korea, equivalent to 15 percent of its staff, have applied for a redundancy package that the U.S. automaker is offering as part of a drastic restructuring.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's annual consumer day TV show took aim at Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and the country's fast-growing bike-sharing market on Thursday in an otherwise subdued outing for the once feared event.
The late evening China Central Television (CCTV) show named and shamed the German carmaker for engine defects with its Touareg SUV, prompting an apology from the company as it looked to salve consumer concerns in the world's largest auto market.
""We sincerely apologise again for any inconvenience and concern this issue may have caused our customers,"" Volkswagen said in a statement, adding it had already filed a recall plan in China related to the issue.
The show, known as ""315"" in reference to global consumer rights day on March 15, has snagged a number of major names. Last year, it turned its spotlight on U.S. sports brand  Nike  (N:NKE) for misleading advertising.
Volkswagen itself has been targeted before - in 2015 for overselling repairs and spare parts to drivers and in 2013 over a gearbox transmission issue.
China's bike-sharing industry, which has boomed since 2016 backed by huge venture capital funding, was also criticised on the show after a number of smaller firms went under and failed to pay back deposits to users.
Companies are, however, becoming more savvy at deflecting criticism, with public relations teams set up in advance to respond if they are targeted.
""It's definitely tougher now to do this show. Many firms start taking precautionary measures half a year in advance,"" said a person close to the show, who declined to be identified as he was not permitted to speak to the media.
However, while the two-hour evening show, an eclectic mix of undercover reports and song-and-dance, has lost some of its bite, companies and PR firms were not letting their guard down.

Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) main profit engine will introduce a new model every three weeks this year, including the redesigned A6 and the all-new Q8, it said on Thursday.
Due to the disruptions, Audi has refrained from projecting another outright increase in deliveries, saying it wants to at least match last year's record 1.88 million sales. Revenue is expected to slightly exceed last year's 60.1 billion euros ($74.31 billion). 
""2018 is an exceptional year and requires a feat of strength from Audi which will pay off in the long term,"" finance chief Alexander Seitz said on Thursday at the carmaker's earnings press conference.
From 2019, the model offensive is expected to have a ""sustained positive impact"" on deliveries and earnings, Audi said.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares rose on Thursday, buoyed by good results from companies including insurance heavyweights Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) and Generali (MI:GASI), while  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) fell after its deputy CEO unexpectedly resigned.
SocGen shares slid 2.5 percent after the French bank said Didier Valet was leaving ‚Äçfollowing ""a divergence of approaches regarding management of a specific legal matter"", without elaborating.
A source familiar with the matter said the divergence related to investigations over the suspected rigging of the Libor interbank rate, although brokers raised concerns over the impact of litigations.
""These uncertainties will put further pressure on the share price, in particular concerns about the triple litigations and the now obvious material disagreements on how to handle them,"" KBW said. SocGen fell as much as 4.3 percent to their lowest level in more than 2 months. 
Gains in the insurance sector (SXIP) and strength among tech stocks >.SX8P>, however, helped push the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) index up 0.3 percent by 0945 GMT. 
Munich Re (DE:MUVGn) rose 1.4 percent after the world's largest reinsurer raised its 2018 profit forecasts and said it plans to buy back 1 billion euros in shares. 
Generali also rose 1.9 percent after it raised its dividend following record operating profit.
Top gainer on the STOXX was British valve maker Spirax-Sarco Engineering (L:SPX), up 4.5 percent after it reported better-than-expected full-year revenues and profit.
However, Swedish clothing firm H&M (ST:HMb) published lower-than-expected quarterly sales, sending shares in the world's second-biggest fashion retailer down 4.6 percent. 
Dufry (S:DUFN) shares fell 7 percent after results with traders attributing the drop to a lack of clarity on its dividend plans.
Banks (SX7P) rose slightly after the European Central Bank released long-delayed guidelines on treating new soured bank debt. The guidelines will go into effect on April 1 but lenders may get a reprieve from full implementation until 2021.
""All looks pretty much in line with expectations with a mild improvement on the schedule of provisioning,"" Mediobanca Securities said in a note to clients. ""We see a mildly net positive for banks today.""

PARIS (Reuters) -  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) shares fell on Thursday after the French bank announced the unexpected departure of deputy chief executive Didier Valet.
SocGen shares were down 2.4 percent in early session trading, making them the worst performer on Paris' benchmark CAC-40 index (FCHI) and one of the worst on the pan-European STOXX 600 index (STOXX).
The STOXX Europe 600 banks index (SX7P) was up 0.4 percent.
Late on Wednesday, SocGen said Valet - its deputy CEO who was also in charge of its investment banking activities - was leaving ""‚Äçfollowing a divergence of approaches regarding management of a specific legal matter"".
SocGen did not give any more details in its statement about the legal matter and said Valet resigned in order to preserve the bank's ""general interests"".
The ""divergence of approaches"" related to investigations over the suspected rigging of the London interbank offered rate (Libor), an interest rate used in contracts worth trillions of dollars globally, a source familiar with the matter said.
""This announcement comes as a negative surprise as Didier Valet was well regarded and the market did not expect top management changes on litigation cases that should be adequately provisioned,"" wrote JP Morgan analysts, who kept a ""neutral"" rating on SocGen shares.
That view was echoed by analysts at investment banks Jefferies and Kepler Cheuvreux. Jefferies kept a ""buy"" rating on SocGen shares but Kepler took a slightly more negative view, with a ""hold"" rating.
""Following the totally unexpected departure of deputy CEO Didier Valet due to a 'divergence of approach regarding the management of a specific legal matter', Societe Generale is left once again in the throes of another crisis,"" Kepler analysts wrote.
""We maintain our 'Hold' rating, but we believe this departure could be the one problem too many for SocGen, which we believe is now at play.""
SocGen is one of several banks to be caught up in investigations into the rigging of Libor around the time of the global financial crisis. U.S. authorities charged two former SocGen managers last August with taking part in a scheme to manipulate the global U.S. dollar Libor benchmark.
""It's the biggest thing to happen in the group since the departure of Jean-Pierre Mustier,"" an insider said of Valet's departure.
Mustier, head of the investment bank at the time of the Jerome Kerviel trading scandal, quit in 2008. He is currently CEO of Italy's UniCredit (MI:CRDI).
Valet, a close and long-time ally of chief executive Frederic Oudea, started his career at SocGen in 2000. He was chief financial officer from 2008 to 2012 and had been head of investment banking activities since 2012.
Under Valet, the bank has worked on making investment bank revenue less volatile by increasing the share of fixed income activities versus equities.

The bank said his replacement would be announced shortly.

Money managers have pulled $2.1 billion from the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity fund this year, which is nearly a third of its total assets, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The exchange-traded fund, which buys stocks listed in Tokyo and shields them against fluctuations in the yen, has seen its shares outstanding plunge 5 percent this month to the lowest level since 2013.
It‚Äôs the same story for funds that protect against foreign exchange fluctuations relative to the euro. The $6.6 billion WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund has bled assets for the past 17 weeks, with shares outstanding tumbling to the lowest level since 2015.
The withdrawals underscore the negative sentiment toward the dollar among currency traders. As the outlook for the global economy brightens and political drama in the U.S. further weakens the greenback, investors have no issue snapping up stocks in Japan and Europe without paying for protection against shifts in the U.S. currency.
‚ÄúThe flow picture has turned,‚Äù George Saravelos, global co-head of foreign-exchange research at  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) in London, wrote in a note this week. ‚ÄúFX-unhedged equity inflows into Japan are beginning, with parallels to the trend in Europe.‚Äù
U.S. holdings of European stocks appear relatively stable despite the global equity rout, an indication that the dollar‚Äôs losing streak against the common currency will continue this year, according to Deutsche Bank AG. At the same time, foreigners are rotating their holdings from currency-hedged equity funds to the unhedged variety to gain exposure to the rising euro.
The iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan ETF has dropped around 3.9 percent this year, compared to a 1.5 percent gain for the unhedged version. The iShares Eurozone hedged ETF, meanwhile, has slumped roughly 0.9 percent versus a 1.5 percent gain for the Europe ETF without currency protection.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's third biggest company  Unilever  (L:ULVR) (AS:UNc) will scrap its London corporate headquarters and make Rotterdam its sole legal home in a blow to Prime Minister Theresa May's government almost one year to the day before Brexit.
The maker of Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream launched a review of its dual-headed structure in 2017 after fighting off a $143 billion takeover from Kraft Heinz (O:KHC), triggering a battle between Britain and the Netherlands.
Unilever said the choice to end 88 years of operating with two parent companies was not linked to Brexit or protectionism, but would simplify its structure, improve its corporate governance and help enable takeover deals. 
Forged by the 1930 merger of the Dutch margarine producer Margarine Unie and the British soap maker Lever Brothers, Unilever said its 7,300 staff in the United Kingdom would be unaffected and it will continue to be listed in London, Amsterdam and New York.
""This is not about Brexit,"" Chief Executive Paul Polman said. ""Unilever is in 190 countries in the world. Most of these countries are not in the European Union.""
Unilever was forced to rethink its structure after it had to fight off one of the biggest takeovers ever proposed in 2017. Unilever swiftly rejected the offer and Kraft walked away in a matter of days but the incident was enough to force the company to pledge to improve its operations. 
Chief Executive Polman had used the incident to argue that British companies should have stronger tools to fight off takeovers. 
Some analysts point out that Dutch takeover law is more protective and speculate that a Dutch-headquartered Unilever could more easily fend off unwelcome suitors in the future.
NOT ABOUT BREXIT
As part of the restructuring, Unilever will create three divisions with Beauty & Personal Care and the Home Care units being headquartered in London. The Foods & Refreshment division will be based in Rotterdam. 
""This secures nearly 1 billion pounds per year of continued spend in the UK, including a significant commitment to R&D,"" it said.
Finance Director Graeme Pitkethly told Reuters that its continued inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index was still to be determined because it had not yet engaged with the index providers. 
Unilever's shares could be hit if it was no longer in the FTSE Index because tracker funds would be forced to sell.
Unilever had held talks with the governments of both countries in the run-up to its decision and the move will be seen as a blow to Prime Minister May who is locked in talks with Brussels over the country's departure from the EU on March 29, 2019.
In recent months, speculation had grown that Unilever would choose the Netherlands after Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, himself a Unilever veteran, proposed a tax change seen as benefiting Anglo-Dutch multinationals. 
The British government said however it welcomed Unilever's long-term commitment to Britain and the protection of jobs. 

""Its decision to transfer a small number of jobs to a corporate HQ in the Netherlands is part of a long-term restructuring of the company and is not connected to the UK's departure from the EU,"" a government spokesman said.

(Reuters) - IHeartMedia Inc (PK:IHRT) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Thursday as the largest U.S. radio station owner reached an agreement with creditors to more than halve its $20 billion in debt.
The company said the agreement it ‚Äçreached with holders of more than $10 billion of its outstanding debt would restructure its balance sheet by transferring 94 percent of the stock in the reorganized company to its lenders. 
IHeartMedia has struggled with debt that was taken on to finance a $17.9 billion leveraged buyout, or LBO, in 2008 of what was then Clear Channel Communications Inc. That deal led by Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP closed just as a financial crisis began to undermine the U.S. economy.
In the years that followed, the operator of 849 radio stations has faced intensifying competition for advertisers and listeners from internet platforms such as music streaming services.
""The LBO put this massive debt on the balance sheet that the company was supposed to grow into,"" a lawyer for iHeartMedia told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Marvin Isgur at a hearing in Houston on Thursday. ""We‚Äôre here to right-size the balance sheet.""
The company traces its roots to the 1972 purchase of KEEZ-FM in San Antonio, Texas, where it is currently headquartered. It said it would fund the business and bankruptcy process from cash on hand and cash generated from operations.
It said in a statement it was seeking to maintain business as usual during the bankruptcy, and to ""uphold its commitments"" to its staff. It employs 12,400 people, according to court records.
The filing comes less than four months after Cumulus Media Inc, which operates 445 U.S. radio stations, filed for Chapter 11.
DEBT-CUTTING DEAL
IHeartMedia had $3.58 billion in revenue in 2017 and reaches 271 million radio listeners, which the company says gives it a wider reach than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's (O:GOOG) Google. The company also sells advertising on digital platforms, at live concerts and on syndicated programs featuring personalities such as Rush Limbaugh and ""American Idol"" host Ryan Seacrest. 
However, the company spent $1.4 billion on interest payments last year and has more than $8 billion in debt maturing by the end of 2019. 
The company's lawyers told the court iHeartMedia was on the cusp of having enough support from creditors to impose its plan on hold-outs.
Under the company's debt-cutting deal, holders of secured loans and secured notes, who are owed nearly $13 billion, agreed to accept about $5.6 billion in new debt and 94 percent of the equity in a reorganized iHeartMedia, according to court documents. 
These creditors also will receive iHeartMedia's 89.5 percent stake in  Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc  (N:CCO), the world's largest billboard company, which did not file for bankruptcy.
IHeartMedia also proposed that junior debt holders, who are owed more than $2 billion, will receive their pro rata share of 5 percent of the equity in the reorganized company and $200 million in new secured notes.
Existing shareholders would receive 1 percent of the stock in the reorganized company, according to court documents.
IHeartMedia faces a legal challenge from a group, led by investment fund Angelo, Gordon & Co, which holds $190 million of junior debt, according to the company. 
Their lawyer said at Thursday's hearing they plan to file a lawsuit to challenge the contention that they are low-priority unsecured creditors, and Isgur said he wanted a hearing on that dispute before April.

IHeartMedia has drawn interest from John Malone's Liberty Media Corp (O:FWONA), which proposed on Feb. 26 a deal to buy a 40 percent stake in a restructured iHeartMedia for $1.16 billion. The deal would unite iHeartMedia with Liberty's Sirius XM Holdings Inc (O:SIRI) satellite radio service.

The documents also show that Amazon's U.S. audience for all video programming on Prime, including films and TV shows it licenses from other companies, was about 26 million customers. Amazon has never released figures for its total audience.
The internal documents compare metrics that have never been reported for 19 shows exclusive to Amazon: their cost, their viewership and the number of people they helped lure to Prime.

Core to Amazon's strategy is the use of video to convert viewers into shoppers. Fans access Amazon's lineup by joining Prime, a club that includes two-day package delivery and other perks, for an annual fee.
The company declined to comment on the documents seen by Reuters. But Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has been upfront about the company's use of entertainment to drive merchandise sales. The world's biggest online retailer launched Amazon Studios in 2010 to develop original programs that have since grabbed awards and Hollywood buzz.
""When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes,"" Bezos said at a 2016 technology conference near Los Angeles. He said film and TV customers renew their subscriptions ""at higher rates, and they convert from free trials at higher rates"" than members who do not stream videos on Prime.
Video has grown to be one of Amazon's biggest expenditures at $5 billion per year for original and licensed content, two people familiar with the matter said. The company has never disclosed how many subscribers it won as a result, making it hard for investors to evaluate its programming decisions.
The internal documents show what Amazon considers to be the financial logic of its strategy, and why the company is now making more commercial projects in addition to high-brow shows aimed at winning awards, the people said.
For example, the first season of the popular drama ""The Man in the High Castle,"" an alternate history depicting Germany as the victor of World War Two, had 8 million U.S. viewers as of early 2017, according to the documents. The program cost $72 million in production and marketing and attracted 1.15 million new subscribers worldwide based on Amazon's accounting, the documents showed.
Amazon calculated that the show drew new Prime members at an average cost of $63 per subscriber.
That is far less than the $99 that subscribers pay in the United States for Prime; the company charges similar fees abroad. Prime members also buy more goods from Amazon than non-members, Bezos has said, further boosting profit.
AMAZON'S SECRET MATH
Precisely how Amazon determines a customer's motivation for joining its Prime club is not clear from the documents viewed by Reuters.
But a person familiar with its strategy said the company credits a specific show for luring someone to start or extend a Prime subscription if that program is the first one a customer streams after signing up. That metric, referenced throughout the documents, is known as a ""first stream.""
The company then calculates how expensive the viewer was to acquire by dividing the show's costs by the number of first streams it had. The lower that figure, the better.
(For a graphic on how Amazon evaluates its TV shows, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2FkFGHg http://tmsnrt.rs/2FkFGHg)
The internal documents do not show how long subscribers stayed with Prime, nor do they indicate how much shopping they do on Amazon. The company reviews other metrics for its programs as well. Consequently, the documents do not provide enough information to determine the overall profitability of Amazon's Hollywood endeavor.
Still, the numbers indicate that broad-interest shows can lure Prime members cheaply by Amazon's calculations. One big winner was the motoring series ""The Grand Tour,"" which stars the former presenters of BBC's ""Top Gear."" The show had more than 1.5 million first streams from Prime members worldwide, at a cost of $49 per subscriber in its first season.
The documents seen by Reuters reflect Prime subscribers in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Austria and Japan, where Amazon's programs were available before Prime Video rolled out globally in December 2016.
Analysts estimate that 75 million or more customers have Prime subscriptions worldwide, including about half of all households in the United States.
BIGGER BETS
About 26 million U.S. Prime members watched television and movies on Amazon as of early 2017. Reuters calculated this number from the documents, which showed how many viewers a TV series had as a percentage of total Prime Video customers.
Rival Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) had twice that many U.S. subscribers in the first quarter of last year. It does not disclose how many were active viewers.
For years, Amazon Studios aimed to win credibility in Hollywood with sophisticated shows beloved by critics. Its marquee series ""Transparent,"" about a transgender father and his family, won eight Primetime Emmy Awards and created the buzz Amazon wanted to attract top producers and actors.
Yet ""Transparent"" lagged Amazon's top shows in viewership. Its first season drew a U.S. audience half as large as that of ""The Man in the High Castle,"" and it fell to 1.3 million viewers for its third season, according to the documents.
Similarly, ""Good Girls Revolt,"" a critically-acclaimed show about gender inequality in a New York newsroom, had total U.S. viewership of 1.6 million but cost $81 million, with only 52,000 first streams worldwide by Prime members.
The program's cost per new customer was about $1560, according to the documents. Amazon canceled it after one season.
Amazon is now working on more commercial dramas and spin-offs with appeal outside the United States, where Prime membership has far more room to grow, people familiar with the matter said.
The effort to broaden Amazon's lineup, long in the works, will be in the hands of Jennifer Salke, NBC Entertainment's president whom Amazon hired last month as its studio chief. Amazon's Bezos has wanted a drama to rival HBO's global hit ""Game of Thrones,"" according to the people.
In November, Amazon announced it will make a prequel to the fantasy hit ""The Lord of the Rings."" The company had offered $250 million for the rights alone; production and marketing could raise costs to $500 million or more for two seasons, one of the people said.
At half a billion dollars, the prequel would cost triple what Amazon paid for ""The Man in the High Castle"" seasons one and two, the documents show. That means it would need to draw three times the number of Prime members as ""The Man in the High Castle"" for an equal payoff.

780,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo faces sanctions for auto insurance payouts - sources,"By Patrick Rucker
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are preparing to sanction  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) for receiving commissions on auto insurance policies it helped force on more than half a million drivers, people with direct knowledge of the probes told Reuters.
In July, Wells Fargo blamed a third-party vendor for wrongly layering insurance policies on its auto borrowers. Wells Fargo did not explain that it received payouts when those policies were written.
The fact that Wells Fargo stood to profit from the insurance program will form the backbone of fresh sanctions against the bank, said people with knowledge of the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.
Those penalties would be the latest in a long-running scandal over how the nation's third-largest lender treated its customers.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Wells Fargo's primary regulator, is asking the bank which executives knew about the payments and whether they should have been stopped sooner, said the sources.
Wells Fargo does not comment on regulatory matters, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Catherine Pulley said. The bank received commissions from insurance partners in a program ended in 2013, she said.
""We are sorry for any harm caused and are focused on the important work to complete our remediation process,"" said Pulley.
Wells Fargo's auto insurance woes stem from a policy drivers must carry when they borrow money to buy a new car. It pays out to the bank when a car is stolen or destroyed.
Wells Fargo required drivers to carry their own policies, but had a right to ""force-place"" a policy on borrowers who let insurance lapse. Insurers working for Wells Fargo pushed policies onto 570,000 customers who already had coverage and then delivered profits for the bank.
Wells is investigating auto insurance abuses back to 2005 and estimates it will need to refund $145 million to borrowers, and adjust account balances by another $37 million, according to securities filings. That is up from its initial cost estimate of $80 million.
In September 2016, the OCC joined other regulators in ordering Wells Fargo to pay $190 million after its employees created phony customer accounts to artificially boost sales figures. That settlement launched more than a year of official scrutiny and revelations of other customer abuses.
A top regulator for personal finance, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), was ready to sue Wells Fargo over improper mortgage fees last year but the agency's current chief put the lawsuit on hold, Reuters previously reported.
A settlement over auto insurance abuse would likely be another joint action among regulators, said people familiar with the probe. The CFPB's mortgage case could be folded into that joint action and the resolution will likely involve financial penalties though the amount has not been settled, they said.
The OCC does not comment on supervisory matters, spokesman Bryan Hubbard said. A CFPB official declined to comment for this story.
In explaining the problems with auto insurance last year, Wells blamed the issue on an unnamed third-party vendor that mistakenly believed those borrowers' insurance had lapsed.
""We had a vendor that was providing insurance,"" Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan told investors in September. ""We should have caught that and we should have dealt with it.""
National General, an insurance company, has monitored the ""force-placed"" coverage for Wells Fargo since 2015, the bank has said. Previously, the program was run by companies including QBE Insurance Group Ltd, Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and defunct Countrywide Financial.

In 2014, Wells Fargo agreed to pay mortgage borrowers who were wrongly pushed into extra flood and wind protection. QBE Insurance managed the bank's force-placed insurance program at the time and was part of the settlement.

781,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 06:49AM ET</span>",Investors still in love with growth stocks risk losing out on value,"By Caroline Valetkevitch
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A long rally in technology stocks has left investors thirsting for more, but that could be a mistake as the strengthening U.S. economy points to better value in other stocks.
Heavyweights like Apple (O:AAPL), Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Facebook (O:FB) have especially helped growth indexes in the past year rise more than value indexes, which right now are heavily weighted in financials.
Tech so far in 2018 is the best-performing sector too, leading the recovery from the market's steep selloff in early February, with the Nasdaq hitting record highs again in recent sessions.
That's reflected in the performance of major benchmarks for portfolio managers, including the Russell 1000 growth index (RLG), up 6.1 percent so far this year, compared with the Russell 1000 value index (RLV), down 0.5 percent since Dec. 31.
But some money managers are betting that trend may have gone on for too long. They argue that value stocks, which tend to have lower valuations, will look especially appealing relative to growth as the economy accelerates above its historic growth rates.
""That growth has continued for as long as it has and as lopsided as it is doesn't mean the world has changed. It means we're overdue for the pendulum to swing back to value,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York.
Growth and value are two classic approaches to investing, with growth investors typically searching for companies that have higher profit growth and margins, while value investors look for stocks that seem undervalued.
A shift from growth to value could come slowly.
Based on Thomson Reuters Lipper data, so far in 2018, U.S. fund investors have been pulling more money out of value funds than growth.
CLS Investments Chief Investment Officer Rusty Vanneman, who has already shifted to favoring value over growth, said investors tend to chase performance, and ""tech names have been the glamor names.""
To be sure, many tech stocks do well when the economy improves, and every sector has stocks in both value and growth.
Katz thinks banks, energy and some stocks in health care, including Gilead Sciences (O:GILD), make good value buys right now.
Helping the argument for value, some strategists say, is a robust economic expansion in the United States. The economy is also being given additional fiscal stimulus through sweeping changes to the tax law approved by Congress late last year, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate.
Growth stocks mostly have outperformed value since the bull market began nine years ago and far outpaced them last year, when the S&P technology index (SPLRCT) rose nearly 37 percent compared with the S&P 500's gain of 19.4 percent.
In 2017, the Russell growth index rose 28.4 percent versus a gain of 10.9 percent in Russell value.
""It's definitely more difficult to find the proper risk-reward ratio in growth right now,"" said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., an investment advisory firm, based in Toledo, Ohio. 
(GRAPHIC: Russell 1000 growth vs value since late 2007 - http://reut.rs/2Hy6X5v) 
The price-to-earnings ratio for the Russell growth index last year hit its highest since 2002. The index is now trading at about 20 times forward earnings, down slightly from recent levels. The value index is trading at less than 15 times earnings, its lowest since 2016, according to Thomson Reuters DataStream data.
(GRAPHIC: Russell 1000 growth PE vs value PE - http://reut.rs/2p8TKJS) 
""It's a valuation argument. Growth has done phenomenally and the valuations reflect that,"" said Ernesto Ramos, head of quantitative equity strategy at BMO Global Asset Management.
Multiples have risen ""across the board,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. But, he said, ""if everything is expensive, value offers a higher margin of safety.""
Financials, which benefit from higher interest rates and would get a boost from reduced regulations that are expected under the Trump administration, have the biggest weighting in the Russell value index, accounting for about 28 percent of the index, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Technology as a sector has the biggest weighting in the Russell Growth 1000 index, accounting for roughly 39 percent. 
JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM), Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa),  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM), Bank of America (N:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) represent the biggest weightings in the Russell 1000 value index, while Apple, Microsoft (O:MSFT), Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Facebook and Alphabet are the biggest weightings in Russell 1000 growth.
Besides telecommunications, financials have the lowest valuation of any S&P 500 sector, trading at about 13.9 times forward earnings compared with technology, which has among the highest, at 19.2 times forward earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data. The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) is trading at 17.3 times forward earnings.

With value, ""you're basically trading tech exposure for financials exposure,"" Ramos said.

782,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 05:26AM ET</span>",Walmart patents hint at future where its drones tend the farms,"By Nandita Bose and Tom Polansek
NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's patent filings hint that it may see a future where farmers use its drones to not only spot crop problems but selectively apply chemicals or even disperse pollen to bring shoppers the freshest and cheapest food possible.
The world's largest retailer applied for six patents last year on drones that aim to prevent damage to crops, control pest attacks on farms and cross-pollinate plants, according to U.S. Patents and Trademark Office documents that were made public last week and seen by Reuters.
Groceries make up 56 percent of the company's total revenue and Walmart may see drone technology as one way to get food from farms to store shelves faster and more cheaply to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), following its purchase of Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ:WFM) last year and the expansion of discount chains like Aldi and Lidl.
In one application, Walmart seeks to patent a system that would use drones to identify crop-damaging pests and then dispense insecticides on the critters. Another suggests the use of drones carrying pollen dispensers to successfully pollinate crops.
Using technology to precisely apply pesticides rather than spraying entire fields can benefit the environment and save money for farmers. As part of a sustainability push in recent years, Walmart has also worked with suppliers to reduce the amount of fertilizer used to grow crops because it can pollute the environment.
Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company always looks for new ways to serve shoppers better but had no comment on the filings. The retailer applies for dozens of patents a year and many do not result in commercial products.
Walmart previously applied for a patent involving drones that could monitor crops' growing conditions and send data to stores about when and from where produce might arrive, said Zoe Leavitt, a senior analyst from data intelligence firm CB Insights, which analyzes corporate patent filings. The series of six applications indicates Walmart is looking into farming more seriously, she said.
Walmart has so far applied for 46 patents for using drone technology, mostly to facilitate its delivery and logistics operations, or for use within warehouses to do things such as track inventory, according to data from CB Insights. 
In U.S. agriculture, drones are most often used to survey farms that can span hundreds of acres. The devices fly above fields and take photos that help growers estimate the size of upcoming harvests or identify problems, such as weed infestations and nutrient deficiencies.
Other industries have also turned to drones, with AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) using the devices to look at cellphone towers in Texas last year after Hurricane Harvey. Insurers such as Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) use them to assess property damage. ""The technology is very powerful and using that to control the supply chain as far out as possible will offer Walmart a distinct advantage over rivals,"" said Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail consultancy Brick Meets Click. 
The market for agricultural drones will top $1 billion by 2024, up from about $338 million in 2016, according to research firm Global Market Insights. However, Walmart's patent applications stand out because they indicate the company sees greater potential to address problems on farms, rather than simply spot them, said David Dvorak, chief executive officer for Field of View, a U.S. company that sells drone camera systems. ""It sounds like Walmart is trying to develop a complete system that can actually do something about it,"" Dvorak said. 
The patent push involving agricultural technology harks back to McDonald Corp's efforts in the 1960s to patent the processing of potatoes into French fries so it could reliably deliver consistent quality fries at the lowest cost in massive volumes. 
""Companies like Walmart for a long time have created sustainability initiatives and this is really where the rubber is meeting the road,"" said Jayson Lusk, head of agricultural economics at Purdue University.
Such environmental-focused initiatives can be attractive to consumers, Lusk said. Eventually Walmart, which is courting more urban, higher income and health conscious shoppers for their online grocery business, could require suppliers to buy food from farmers who use agricultural technology to reduce chemicals to produce crops, he said. 

""A way how this might come down is the imposition of standards on their suppliers,"" Lusk said.

783,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2018 10:09AM ET</span>",India's PNB uncovers more fraud at troubled Mumbai branch,"By Devidutta Tripathy and Neha Dasgupta
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) (NS:PNBK) has uncovered another credit-guarantee fraud within the Mumbai branch at the center of a similar scam worth over $2 billion, according to a complaint filed with the federal police.
The alleged embezzlement of around 91 million rupees ($1.40 million) involved executives of a company called Chandri Paper and Allied Products, according to the complaint filed by PNB with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
The newly uncovered scam raises fresh doubts about whether more such cases involving fraudulent guarantees lurk on the books of PNB, the second biggest state-run lender, or other government-owned Indian banks.
The new case came to light after India's central bank ordered all state-run lenders to provide it with details of all letters of undertaking - a form of credit guarantee used to orchestrate the alleged $2 billion fraud - issued by them in the past several years.
Separately, top executives from state-run lenders, including market leader  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI), on Thursday sought to reassure investors and vowed to strengthen systems and practices at the banks that account for two-thirds of India's banking assets.
BANKERS RESPOND
Each bank has already scanned their credit-guarantee transactions involving letters of undertaking and found all to be genuine except those already reported, the group of bankers told a news conference in New Delhi.
The bankers' comments come a day after a strongly worded speech by the Indian central bank chief Urjit Patel, who said the Reserve Bank of India did not have enough authority over the government-owned banks, which are also regulated by the government.
In its latest regulatory clampdown after the PNB fraud, the RBI, which has faced criticism for not being able to police the banks, this week barred banks from issuing letters of undertaking.
In what has been called India's biggest banking fraud, PNB has accused jeweler groups headed by diamond tycoon Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi of colluding with bank employees to get fraudulent letters of undertaking, which helped them raise credit of about $2 billion from overseas branches of Indian banks.
Through their lawyers, Modi and Choksi have denied any wrongdoing.
SAME BANK OFFICIALS
In the latest case that came to light on Thursday, PNB told the CBI that two officials at its Brady House branch in Mumbai ""entered into a criminal conspiracy"" with directors of Chandri Paper in April 2017 to fraudulently issue two letter of undertaking for the company to raise the money.
According to the complaint, the same set of bank officials were allegedly involved in the cases involving both the jewelers and Chandri Paper. The two officials - one of them already retired - were arrested last month. They have denied any wrongdoing in the case involving the jewelers.
A PNB spokesman had no immediate comment on the Chandri paper case. Chandri Paper could not immediately be reached for comment.

PNB shares closed 0.8 percent down in a Mumbai market that fell 0.5 percent.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank of Australia (AX:CBA) Chief Executive Ian Narev knew that a system of financial incentives to reward mortgage brokers could hurt customers but failed to act, an inquiry into Australia's financial sector heard on Thursday.
A confidential letter penned by Narev in 2017 and disclosed on the third day of the financial sector Royal Commission criticized the practice of paying brokers more for bigger loans, an incentive still widely in place including at CBA.
Instead of ordering changes to remuneration practices to protect customers from taking out loans they could struggle to pay off, CBA chose to protect ""volume"" in the bank's highly lucrative mortgage business, a CBA executive said.
""We agree ... that while brokers provide a service that many potential mortgagees value, the use of loan size linked with up-front and trailing commissions for third parties can potentially lead to poor customer outcomes,"" wrote Narev, who is stepping down as CEO next month after a series of scandals at the bank.
Under questioning, CBA's executive general manager home buying, Daniel Huggins, said that although Narev supported changes to incentives, nothing was done to unwind the broker commission system because the bank would lose business to rivals.
""I think we have acknowledged there is a conflict in the commission structure,"" Huggins said under questioning at the public inquiry in Melbourne.
""There is a first-mover problem, in that the (bank) who moved first would likely lose a lot of volume.""
Broker payments, particularly trailing commissions paid over the life of a loan, are a sensitive topic for Australian financial institutions as the four biggest banks derived A$51.77 billion ($40.8 billion) from mortgage agents in the September quarter of 2017, according to the inquiry. 
As the country's biggest lender, CBA attracts about 40 percent of new home loans from brokers.
The year-long Royal Commission has extensive powers to subpoena documents and can recommend criminal or civil prosecutions and legislative changes, potentially forcing changes to broker incentives. 
The center-right government agreed to call an inquiry after years of scandals in Australia's financial sector, which included poor financial advice, interest-rate rigging, and accusations of money-laundering.
CBA is the second bank to be scrutinized after National Australia Bank (AX:NAB), which conceded on the opening days of the inquiry that its system of bonuses and incentives encouraged bankers to engage in fraudulent lending practices.
LACK OF COMPETITION 
In another blow to the banks, the competition regulator said in a separate report released on Thursday that there was ""less-than-vigorous price competition"" between Australia's ""Big Four"" - CBA, NAB, Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC) and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (AX:ANZ). 
""We do not often see the big four banks vying to offer borrowers the lowest interest rates. Their pricing behavior seems more accommodating and consistent with maintaining current positions,"" Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.
While the Royal Commission has so far focused on poor lending practices, the push for an inquiry was fueled by concerns banks were using out-of-cycle mortgage rate rises to boost profits, to the detriment of consumers.
Out-of-cycle rises refer to increases in mortgage rates even when the central bank has not raised the cash rate. Australia's big banks are often criticized for uniformly opting for out-of-cycle rises, leaving borrowers with little choice but to pay more.

785,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 11:00PM ET</span>",Shareholder Revolt Emerges as Key Risk for Noble Group Debt Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- A revolt by Noble Group Ltd.‚Äôs shareholders has emerged as one of the major threats to the struggling trading house‚Äôs $3.5 billion restructuring deal after it agreed terms with a group of hedge fund creditors.
If shareholders vote against the deal, the company will seek to implement the restructuring as a prepackaged administration in the U.K., an action that would effectively concede the company‚Äôs insolvent, Noble said on Wednesday as it announced an agreement on the terms of the restructuring with 46 percent of its senior creditors.
Noble is teetering on the brink of collapse following a crisis that started three years ago when then-unknown Iceberg Research began publishing critiques of the company‚Äôs accounting. Since then, the company‚Äôs been battered by losses and its stock driven to near two-decade lows while asset sales have reduced it to a shadow of its former self.
Any insolvency process driven by the courts would be ""very damaging indeed"" for the company‚Äôs trading business, which relies on the ongoing confidence of suppliers and buyers from Indonesian coal miners to Chinese steel mills, Chairman Paul Brough told investors last month.
If Noble‚Äôs counter-parties, including coal miners and steelmakers, are able to claim it equates to a so-called credit event under their contracts, they may be able to walk away from their long-term deals with Noble.
That gives shareholders, whose claims on the company are the most junior in its capital structure, unusual power. What‚Äôs more, several of the largest shareholders held talks with the company‚Äôs advisers last week and expressed their concerns with the deal, an outline of whose terms were published in January, according to people familiar with the matter.
Biggest Stakes
The largest shareholder is Richard Elman, the company‚Äôs founder, who still sits on its board. The next biggest are Orbis Allan Gray,  Prudential  (LON:PRU) Plc, China Investment Corp., and Goldilocks Investment Co., and the four collectively hold 38.4 percent of the company, according to Bloomberg data. The deal will require the approval of at least 50 percent of shareholders voting at a meeting planned for late April or early May.
In a tacit recognition of the shareholders‚Äô importance to the restructuring, Noble has marginally sweetened the deal for them from an original plan in January.
First, the company increased the amount of equity in the restructured company that could go to shareholders, at the expense of the share for management. As before, existing shareholders and management would initially get 10 percent each of the restructured company‚Äôs equity. But, in a change from the preliminary deal announced in January, management would have to offer to split a further 15 percent that it can gain through purchases and an incentive scheme with the company‚Äôs shareholders.
Second, shareholders who approve the deal will get a stake in the restructured company, even if the shareholder meeting as a whole votes against the deal, according to the terms of the agreement published on Wednesday -- an extremely unusual clause in for a restructuring deal.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd plans to begin building a new memory chip production line in China in late March, a spokesman said on Thursday, as the tech giant ramps up efforts to boost NAND flash technology to meet future demand. 
The tech giant said in August last year that it expected to invest $7 billion over the next three years to expand its NAND memory chip production in China's northwestern city of Xi'an, but had not specified a future schedule. 
The rapidly growing data center market, which needs more memory capacity to handle increasing data traffic, is expected to underpin revenue growth and margins for Samsung's NAND Flash business in 2018, research provider Trendforce said. 
Samsung's revenue from NAND in the fourth quarter of 2017 rose 9.8 percent from the previous quarter to $6.17 billion, Trendforce said, as demand from both smartphone and server markets lifted shipments and average price. 
Samsung will formally begin the process near month-end at Xi'an, earmarked for NAND flash production, the spokesman said, but did not give any other details. 
Samsung Electronics shares have risen about 13 percent from early March on an improved outlook for the memory chip market, putting to rest concerns that the recent boom might end, analysts said. 
""Memory chips are solid. For DRAM chips, server demand is very strong,"" said Kwon Sung-ryul, an analyst at DB Investment & Securities. 
""NAND flash chip shipments and price movements are moving within expectations, but there's a chance that supply will become tighter again in the second half of 2018 due to rising demand."" 

The expansion is not expected to affect memory chip supply until 2019 at the earliest, analysts said.

""Exporters have been a bit weak and you can see there are some worries about whether other countries will retaliate ... but you really have to stick to the economic outlook and, in fact, we think the economic outlook remains very good.""
The trade tensions hadn't gone off the boil completely. 
China's widely read state-run tabloid the Global Times said the United States was trying to play the victim with its claims of trade imbalances while Europe's export powerhouse Germany warned that a trade war could ""cause tangible damage"".
The big bond market safety plays -- U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds -- steadied after a brief early European sell-off. If they manage a fourth day of gains it will be the longest winning streak since November. 
Larry Kudlow, incoming director of the White House national economic council, had said on Wednesday that China had earned a tough response on trade, even though he has previously criticized ""blanket"" tariffs.
He also said he would like to see the dollar a ""wee bit stronger than it is currently"". 
In an ominous sign for Trump's Republicans eight months before national mid-term elections, a moderate Democrat candidate looked to have won what should have been a shoo-in congressional election for Republicans in Pennsylvania.
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the grrenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.2 percent at 89.698 ahead of U.S. trading and at $1.2345 against the euro (EUR=), having fallen almost 1.5 percent this month.
Just before the U.S. opened, data showed another fall in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. 
For inflation watchers such as the Federal Reserve, U.S. import prices also rose more than expected in February.
JAPAN HOLDING UP
Asian trading had been mixed.
Shanghai lost 0.3 percent (SSEC) whereas Hong Kong's Hang Seng (HSI) ended flat and Japan's Nikkei (N225) erased early losses to finish just about up despite a stronger yen and an ongoing scandal surrounding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso.
Abe has denied wrongdoing by himself or his wife, and Aso has denied instructing any cover-up in a row over the discounted sale of state-owned land to a school operator. 
Japan's equity market ""has been holding up relatively well"" but will have to decline if U.S. shares deepen their losses, said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo.
There was brighter news elsewhere in the region as China's President Xi Jinping offered encouragement for South Korea's initiative to nurture peaceful engagement with North Korea, and Russia also expressed support.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has also begun a rare two-day visit to Sweden, which represents the United States diplomatically in the isolated country, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.
The Norwegian crown rose to its highest in four months after the country's central bank signaled that its first rate rise in seven years will come earlier than previously expected.
Sterling, though, was back below $1.40 as Britain and Russia continued to trade barbs a day after the UK said it would expel 23 Russian diplomats over the poisoning of a former Russian spy living in Britain.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused London of behaving in a ""boorish"" way with the expulsions and that Moscow's response would come ""very soon"".
There was also more Brexit stress for the pound. France's markets watchdog said the European Union's system for granting financial market access would have to be toughened up after Brexit. 
Britain's third-biggest company  Unilever  (LON:ULVR), meanwhile, said it was scrapping its London corporate headquarters. 
In metals markets, safe-haven gold lost some of its appeal, with spot prices dipping 0.1 percent to $1,326.16 an ounce .
Oil prices held steady, though, with Brent crude futures (LCOc1) at $64.91 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) fractionally higher at $61.05.

The market is being supported by healthy global demand, but that is being offset by a relentless rise in U.S. production that is undermining OPEC-led efforts to cut supplies and prop up prices.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The head of a Mexican congressional committee on Tuesday called for an investigation of an investment by state workers' pension fund PensionIssste, after Reuters reported it spent millions on shares in a company spiraling toward bankruptcy.
PensionIssste spent around 400 million pesos ($21.5 million) buying the largest stake in builder ICA (MX:ICA), even after its shares had fallen by more than half in the previous year, three people with knowledge of the investment told Reuters. 
It stands to lose almost all its investment in a restructuring.
Monday's report angered many people in Mexico, where the opaque use of resources by public entities has been a recurrent theme during the six years of President Enrique Pena Nieto's government. 
""They can't play with workers money like this, it's not their money, it's the people's money,"" Araceli Damian, president of the Social Security Committee in Mexico's house of deputies told Reuters late on Tuesday after the story was widely reprinted and commented on in Mexican media.
""It's not normal, they invested in a company that was clearly in a situation that put workers savings at risk.""
Damian, who is from presidential frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's Morena party, said that Mexico's Public Administration Ministry SFP, the government‚Äôs main anti-corruption auditor, should investigate how the decision was made to invest the money. 
Issste, the government workers' social security body, said in a statement on Tuesday that PensionIssste's investment decisions were made in strict accordance with the law and that its portfolio was ""extremely conservative.""
Issste did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Damian's call for an investigation.
Regulator Consar said that it looked at the purchases and found they complied with the rules.
But Gustavo De Hoyos, head of prominent business chamber Coparmex, said the situation was worrying and that there must be checks made that no investment rules were broken.
""We are owed a clear, conclusive, unequivocal explanation on whether, in the investment process, the rules were scrupulously observed,"" he told reporters on Tuesday on the sidelines of an event.
Several of Mexico's leading national newspaper columnists have written about the report. One columnist at Mexico's Excelsior newspaper said ""There are some stories that just make you angry. This is one of them.""

792,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 09:26PM ET</span>","Toys 'R' Us plans to close all U.S. stores; 33,000 jobs at risk: source","By Tracy Rucinski 
(Reuters) - Bankrupt Toys 'R' Us Inc is preparing to sell or close all 885 stores in its U.S. chain, risking up to 33,000 jobs, after failing to reach a deal to restructure billions of dollars in debt, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
With shoppers flocking to online platforms like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and children choosing electronic gadgets over toys, Toys 'R' Us has struggled to service debt from a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms KKR & Co LP (N:KKR) and Bain Capital and real estate investor  Vornado Realty  Trust (N:VNO) in 2005.
Toys 'R' Us had been closing one-fifth of its U.S. stores as part of efforts to emerge from one of the largest ever bankruptcies by a specialty retailer.
But creditors decided they can get more from liquidating assets of the toy seller, the largest in the United States and one of the best known in the world, rather than finding a way to keep the business alive, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private negotiations.
A Toys 'R' Us spokeswoman declined to comment. 
The company is expected to make a filing with the bankruptcy court late on Wednesday, the person said.
The planned closure in coming months is a blow to generations of consumers and hundreds of toy makers that sold products at the chain, including Barbie maker  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT), board game company  Hasbro Inc  (O:HAS) and other large vendors such as Lego.
In Britain, the remaining 75 Toys 'R' Us shops will close within six weeks, joint administrators for the retailer said earlier on Wednesday, after they were unable to find a buyer for all or part of the business, resulting in the loss of about 3,000 jobs.
The Wall Street Journal earlier on Wednesday reported that Toys 'R' Us Chief Executive David Brandon told U.S. staff about the likely closures on a conference call.
Efforts to restructure collapsed this month after lenders decided, absent a clear reorganization plan, they could recover more by closing stores and raising money from merchandise sales, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
""It's a relentlessly difficult retail environment for mall-based retailers. There just aren't the same feet coming through the doors,"" said Brian Davidoff, a financial restructuring lawyer.
More than 8,000 U.S. retail stores closed in 2017, roughly double the average annual store closures in the previous decade, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Toys 'R' Us is also likely to liquidate in France, Spain, Poland and Australia, Brandon said, according to The Wall Street Journal. It quoted Brandon as adding that the retailer also planned to sell operations in Canada, Central Europe and Asia.
Toys 'R' Us was already working with liquidators Tiger Capital Group LLC, Great American Group LLC, Hilco Merchant Resources LLC and Gordon Brothers Retail Partners LLC on previously announced store closures, and the four are expected to continue with the additional closings, sources said. 
The future of the retailer's big-box shops, many located in strip centers, was uncertain.
The disappearance of Toys 'R' Us in the United States and the UK leaves a void for hundreds of toy makers that relied on the chain as a top customer alongside WalMart Inc (N:WMT) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT).
Shares in Mattel, the world's largest toymaker, and No. 2 U.S. toymaker Hasbro tumbled last week on liquidation reports. Both companies rely on Toys 'R' Us for roughly 10 percent of their revenues, according to their 2016 annual reports.
The liquidation will be more painful for small, independent toy makers that relied on the chain as a major showcase, said Lutz Muller, president of consultancy Klosters Trading Corp. 

""A large number will go to the wall,"" Muller said.

793,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 05:50PM ET</span>",Automakers knew earlier of Takata air bag issues: court documents,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) knew of problems with Takata air bag inflators and should have moved faster to recall vehicles, according to company documents cited on Wednesday by owners suing the automakers.
Amended class-action complaints filed in U.S. District Court in Miami say the four automakers knowingly misrepresented their vehicles as safe. The lawsuits, which claim economic losses, cite internal company documents that suggest the automakers knew of issues earlier than previously known - and well before issuing recalls.
""These auto manufacturers were well aware of the public safety risks posed by Takata's airbags long ago, and still waited years to disclose them to the public and take action,"" said Peter Prieto, a lawyer for the owners.
At least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries worldwide are linked to the Takata inflators that can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June.
GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson said there were no ruptures of GM inflators at issue. ""The lawsuit is baseless and without merit and misstates a host of material facts.¬†We intend to defend it vigorously,"" he said.
Fiat Chrysler and Volkswagen declined to comment. Daimler said in a statement it regarded ""the accusations as unfounded.""
Takata said in June it had recalled, or expected to recall, inflators in about 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States in vehicles built by 19 automakers.
Other automakers have settled economic loss cases that are part of the same legal battle in Florida, worth more than $1.2 billion in total. In September, Honda Motor Co (T:7267) agreed to a $605 million settlement.
A federal judge in Miami previously approved settlements with Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Subaru Corp (T:7270), BMW AG (DE:BMWG), Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and Mazda Motor Corp (T:7261) totaling $650 million. A similar suit against  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) is pending. 
The settlements covered several forms of economic damages linked to the inflators, including claims that vehicles were inaccurately represented to be safe, and that buyers had overpaid for cars with defective or substandard air bags.
All but two of the 22 deaths occurred in Honda vehicles. The remaining two deaths occurred in 2006 Ford pickup trucks.
In 2017, Takata pleaded guilty to criminal wrongdoing and paid nearly $1 billion to resolve a U.S. federal investigation into its inflators.

A U.S. Senate panel will hold a hearing next Tuesday on the Takata recalls.

Earlier this month, Wells Fargo said it was examining its wealth and investment management business for possible customer abuse, including overcharging and inappropriate referrals, after inquiries from government agencies.
Sloan took over the top job in October 2016 after former CEO John Stumpf was forced to resign in the wake of the scandal. 
Some $15 million of Sloan's 2017 pay consists of stock awards, Wells Fargo said in a regulatory filing

1. Traders Eye Data on Labor Market, Manufacturing, Consumer Confidence
A deluge of data awaits market participants on Thursday as regional U.S. manufacturing reports, consumer confidence and an update on the labor market is expected to be closely monitored.
Economists forecast the Philly Fed manufacturing index for March to show a reading of 23.2, slightly below the 25.8 reading in the previous month. While the New York Fed‚Äôs Empire State manufacturing index ‚Äì a gauge of New York-area manufacturing ‚Äì is expected to show a rise in March compared to the previous month.
The Labor department releases its weekly count of the  number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended March 9, expected to show a drop to 230,000 from 231,000 the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are expected to have increased to 1.9 million for the week ended March 9 from 1.870 million.
The Bloomberg Consumer Confidence Index ‚Äì which measures views on the condition of the U.S. economy, personal finances and the buying climate ‚Äì will also be closely monitored after an uptick to a reading of 56.8 last week.
The dollar traded flat against a basket of major currencies Wednesday after retail sales fell for the third-straight month for the first time since April 2012.
2. Natural Gas, IEA Monthly Report In Focus 
The International Energy Agency (IEA) releases its monthly report at 05:00 a.m. ET,  outlining key developments impacting oil market trends.
Market participants are likely to monitor the IEA‚Äôs forecast on U.S. production closely after the energy watchdog in February said ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù growth in U.S. shale oil could soon force OPEC to take action.
Crude oil prices settled 25 cents higher at $60.96 a barrel on Wednesday after a massive draw in gasoline supplies offset a rise in crude stockpiles.
The Energy Information Agency‚Äôs releases weekly natural gas storage data expected to show natural gas fell by 96 billion cubic feet last week. Natural gas prices fell by 1.69% to $2.74 on Wednesday.
3. Kudlow Replaces Cohn as White House Economic Adviser
President Donald Trump on Wednesday confirmed that television commentator and economic analyst Larry Kudlow will replace Gary Cohn as the top White House economic adviser.
Mr Kudlow ‚Äì a free trade advocate ‚Äì insisted on Wednesday that China has been guilty of skirting the rules on international trade, earning the right for a ‚Äútough response‚Äù in trade.
""China has earned a tough response not only from the United States,"" Kudlow told CNBC.
Kudlow‚Äôs tough stance on China, however, is unlikely to ease investor fears over the prospect of a trade war.
U.S. stocks tumbled after the White House said it would increase its efforts to trim the US trade deficit with China by $100 billion. Traders feared that any attempt to impose trade restrictions will lead to a tit-for-tat trade war between the world‚Äôs two largest economics.
The Dow jones plunged nearly 250 points to close at 2,4758.12 on Wednesday, weighed by 2.5% slump in shares of Boeing (NYSE:BA), as the aircraft manufacturer would likely come under pressure should China decide to retaliate against U.S. tariffs."

808,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 04:40PM ET</span>","Google, Apple face EU law on business practices","By Julia Fioretti
(Reuters) - Online platforms such as Google (O:GOOGL), Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN) face new European Union rules on their commercial practices with smaller businesses that use their services, as Brussels seeks to curtail their huge market power.
The European Commission is drafting a new regulation specifically targeting online platforms such as e-commerce sites, app stores and search engines that will require the companies to be more transparent about how they rank search results and why they delist some services.
The proposal seeks to address potentially harmful trading practices by online platforms and a lack of effective redress mechanisms for smaller businesses that use them to reach consumers.
""Online intermediation services can hold superior bargaining power over their business users, enabling them to behave unilaterally in a way that is capable of harming the businesses using them,"" the draft regulation, seen by Reuters, says.
Tech companies have faced significant regulatory pressure from Brussels, be it over their handling of swathes of user data, how much they pay in taxes or the proliferation of extremist content on social media.
The proposal was initially meant to exclude search engines such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft's Bing (O:MSFT), but these will now be included given the impact a business's ranking in search results can have on its revenues.
The EU's antitrust chief in June hit Google with a record 2.42 billion euro ($2.99 billion) fine for favoring its own shopping service over those of rivals.
Under the proposal, operators of search engines, app stores as well as e-commerce sites such as eBay (O:EBAY) will have to specify upfront the ""most important parameters determining ranking"", such as ""specific signals incorporated into algorithms"" and adjustment or demotion mechanisms.
The proposal will not force companies to disclose their algorithms but just provide descriptions at a general level explaining ""how and to what extent the relevant ranking mechanism takes account of the quality of the products and services offered"".
Online platforms will also have to implement a notice period of at least 15 days for changes to their terms and conditions as well as provide businesses with an ""individualized"" description of the reasons for which they have been de-listed or suspended - for example from Apple's App Store or Google Play.
Where companies have their own services competing with other businesses on their platforms - for example Google's own comparison shopping service in Google search results - their terms and conditions will have to include a description of any preferential treatment they give to their own service including access to consumer data and ranking.
The proposal is expected to be published in April, after which it will have to be agreed by national governments and the European Parliament.

(Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc's (N:CMG) chief marketing and strategy officer has resigned, the company said on Wednesday, just nine days after former Taco Bell head Brian Niccol took the helm at the troubled U.S. burrito chain.
Mark Crumpacker will leave Chipotle on March 15, according to a regulatory filing. Crumpacker could not be reached immediately for comment.
Chipotle in a statement thanked Crumpacker for his role in shaping and defining the brand since joining the company in January 2009, and said it would continue its marketing plans while finalizing plans for a new chief marketing officer. 
Investors expect Niccol, who demonstrated menu and marketing prowess at Yum Brands Inc's (N:YUM) Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, to tap his professional network for talent. 
Chipotle, which used its ""Food with Integrity"" tagline to build a loyal following, disappointed some investors in September 2016 when it reinstated Crumpacker just months after he was charged with multiple counts of cocaine possession.
He pleaded guilty to cocaine possession in January 2017. Prosecutors agreed to dismiss the case if he received treatment for a year and stayed out of trouble.
Crumpacker's efforts, particularly food giveaways aimed at wooing back customers after a series of reputation-crushing food safety lapses in late 2015, were costly and failed to resonate with customers amid fierce competition from rival restaurant operators. 
Some campaigns left customers and rival marketers scratching their heads. For example, Chipotle's June 2017 buy-one-get-one-free advertisement for nurses showed a foil-wrapped burrito ""dressed"" in blue scrubs and a stethoscope. The text read ""Code Burrito"" - leaving some viewers to think of ""Code Blue"" medical emergencies. 
Chipotle disclosed in a January filing that it had signed retention agreements of $1 million for Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung and $600,000 for Crumpacker that would reward them for staying one year after a new CEO was appointed. 
A Chipotle spokesman said Crumpacker will receive previously negotiated post-employment payments, including his retention bonus.
Hartung's and Crumpacker's retention agreements included several scenarios for payment upon their early departures - including reductions in duties and moving primary work locations by more than 30 miles. 
Niccol took the helm from Chipotle founder Steve Ells on March 5 and is based at Chipotle's Denver headquarters. 

Ells and Crumpacker work from Chipotle's New York office and Hartung is based in Chicago.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) on Wednesday agreed to a long-awaited experiment to test the effects of lowering stock exchange fees following criticism the current pricing system ultimately hurts investors.
The pilot would force exchanges to lower the fees they charge for matching buy and sell orders and the size of rebates they pay market makers, allowing the SEC to analyze if the current system distorts traders' decisions about where to send orders.
Consumer advocates say the current pricing regime creates conflicts of interest by giving incentives for brokers to send their customers‚Äô orders to the exchanges with the biggest rebates rather than to exchanges that would obtain the best result for the end clients.
Currently, the fees exchanges can charge for trades they execute are capped at 30 cents per 100 shares. Rebates, which not all exchanges pay, are generally in line with the fee cap.
The so-called access fee pilot, first proposed in July 2016 by a committee of market experts picked by the SEC, would require all exchanges to test capping fees lower than their current levels across different buckets of stocks, reducing the amount of funds available to pay rebates.
One bucket would offer no rebates at all.
On Wednesday, the Commission voted unanimously in favor of the proposal for the transaction fee pilot.
""The transaction-fee pilot should give the Commission significantly more robust data than we have now to assess how fees and rebates affect order routing, execution quality, and market depth,"" Commissioner Robert Jackson said in a statement.
The three main U.S. exchange operators had strongly opposed the plan, saying it would make stocks harder to trade. Those operators are the New York Stock Exchange, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, Cboe Global Markets Inc, which owns No. 2 U.S. stock exchange Bats, and Nasdaq Inc 
The bourses collectively pay around $2.5 billion a year in rebates, which they have said compensate market makers for the risks of providing liquidity. Without that additional liquidity, investors, listed companies and exchanges would all suffer, they say.
The exchanges also said that without the ability to pay rebates, it would be harder for them to compete with private broker-run trading venues, known as dark pools, which have fewer regulatory burdens.

The full details of the SEC pilot proposal will be released at a later date and subject to industry feedback.

""Falling demand for diesel vehicles will mean that residual values may fall substantially short of initial expectations,"" Moody's said in a note on Wednesday.
Diesel registrations as a percentage of the German auto market dropped from 48 percent in 2015 to 32.5 in February 2018, Moody's said.
Under most leasing and financing contracts, automotive banks and dealerships remain on the hook for guaranteeing the residual value of the used car when customers return the vehicle upon contract expiry.
At present, around 75 percent of German new registrations are supported by a financing contract, predominantly by leases or balloon loans that only partly amortize during the contract term, Moody's said.

The number of days used diesel vehicles remained with dealers as inventory has risen from 80-85 days in the second quarter of 2016, on a par with petrol cars, to above 90 throughout 2017 and above 100 days since October 2017, Moody's said.

836,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 02:01PM ET</span>","Kudlow's Best, Worst Calls: No 2007 Recession to Trump Bump","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Donald Trump says he is ‚Äúvery strongly‚Äù considering hiring CNBC commentator Larry Kudlow as the director of his National Economic Council, replacing Gary Cohn. Kudlow told the Wall Street Journal that he accepted Trump‚Äôs job offer and that an announcement could come Thursday.
Kudlow‚Äôs media career, including a column called ‚ÄúKudlow‚Äôs Corner,‚Äù leaves a long trail of forecasts for the U.S. economy, some of which proved accurate and others that fell short. He‚Äôs supported much of Trump‚Äôs agenda but criticized some key elements of it.
Here‚Äôs a collection of key comments:
Kudlow on the 2007-09 Financial Crisis:
In 2005, he said ‚Äúall the bubbleheads‚Äù looking for a housing-price crash in Las Vegas and Naples, Florida, and the wider economy, would be proven wrong.
By December 2007, the month the National Bureau of Economic Research later dated the start of the recession, he was arguing there was no recession and that the ‚ÄúBush boom continues.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe pessimistas are a persistent bunch,‚Äù he said.
Kudlow on Inflation:
He predicted in 2010 that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen would spur higher inflation, which didn‚Äôt happen.
In 2014 he argued lower oil prices are unambiguously good -- versus the Fed‚Äôs and most economists‚Äô view that there are winners and losers to lower oil prices as the U.S. has become a bigger producer.
Kudlow on Economic Growth:
Echoing Trump, Kudlow in 2015 said the U.S. should have a 5 percent growth target, which is more than most economists think is realistic. The Fed‚Äôs long-term growth estimate is less than 2 percent. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin sees the U.S. economy expanding by 3 percent or faster because of tax and regulatory reforms.
In 2016, Kudlow predicted a business recession looms. Profits did decline before recovering.
Kudlow on Tax Cuts:
In December, he said Trump‚Äôs tax overhaul will lead to 3 percent to 4 percent growth, more optimistic than most forecasts, and said the president is on the side of the ‚Äúgrowth angels.‚Äù
He said in February that a recovering economy could push long-term interest rates beyond 3.5 percent.
Kudlow on Immigration:
In 2015, he called for a halt to immigration, changing his position he said because of national security concerns: ‚ÄúSeal the borders,‚Äù he wrote.
Kudlow on Trade:
He criticized Trump‚Äôs trade agenda before his election and more recently labelled his tariffs as tax hikes and prosperity killers.
He‚Äôs joined other economists in warning they put at risk 5 million jobs in industries that use steel.
Kudlow on the Dollar:
He has argued Trump needs to embrace a strong dollar policy.
Kudlow on the Trump Market:
He predicted the stock market would go up if Trump was elected. Contrary to a lot of commentators, he was right.

Last week activist fund Elliott Advisors said it had taken a stake in  Telecom Italia  (TIM) and was ready to replace board members in a drive to improve strategy, value and governance.
The spokesman said Vivendi CEO and TIM Chairman Arnaud De Puyfontaine was ready to consider suspending his executive functions at the phone incumbent during the period devoted to this strategic debate.
""Elliott Management repeatedly attacks States and companies... and is known for its financial approach focused on short term gains, most probably leading in this case to dismantling TIM,"" the spokesman said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors withdrew billions from domestic stocks during the equity market's tariff tantrum, the Investment Company Institute (ICI) said on Wednesday, adding turbulence to a market that has shed its carefree attitude.
Some $11 billion was liquidated from U.S.-based domestic stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the seven days ended March 7, according to the trade group, as U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum.
Fears of inflation stoked by rising wages, a falling dollar or a trade war sparked by the tariffs have kept markets on edge. Not only does inflation erode the value of cash, it could also force the U.S. Federal Reserve to further raise rates and tighten monetary policy, slowing the economy.
That stew of concerns has made fund investors jumpier, with demand for domestic stock funds deteriorating overall and growing more fickle from week to week in 2018 compared to last year, the ICI data shows.
""We don't seem to be in a phase where people are buying the dips when the market trades off. They seem to be more cautious,"" said Janet Johnston, portfolio manager for TrimTabs Asset Management LLC.
""This is the bull market that no one loves.""
Johnston said the nine-year-old bull market is still on strong footing, with U.S. tax cuts adopted last year plumping corporate profits.
Overall, stock funds posted $6.5 billion outflows for the week, with some of the domestic equity withdrawals offset by continuing demand for international equities. Bond funds took in just $1.5 billion, ICI said, also weaker than their trend this year. Funds invested in commodities took in $206 million, marking their 8th straight week of inflows.

LONDON (Reuters) - One of the biggest bitcoin exchanges has struck a rare deal which will allow it to open a bank account with Britain's  Barclays  (L:BARC), making it easier for UK customers of the exchange to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, the UK boss of the exchange said on Wednesday.
Large global banks have been reluctant to do business with companies that handle bitcoin and other digital coins because of concerns they are used by criminals to launder money and that regulators will soon crack down on them.
San Francisco-based exchange, Coinbase, said its UK subsidiary was the first to be granted an e-money license by the UK's financial watchdog, a precursor to getting the banking relationship with Barclays.
The Barclays account will make it easier for British customers. Previously, they had to transfer pounds into euros and go through an Estonian bank. 
""Having domestic GBP payments with Barclays reduces the cost, improves the customer experience...and makes the transaction faster,"" said Zeeshan Feroz, Coinbase's UK CEO.
The UK is the largest market for Coinbase in Europe, and the exchange said its customer base in the region was growing at twice the rate of elsewhere.
Feroz said that it took considerable time to get a UK bank on board, partly because Barclays needed to be sure that Coinbase had the right systems in place to prevent money laundering.
Regulators across the globe have warned that cryptocurrencies are used by criminals to launder money, and some exchanges have been shut down. 
""It's a completely brand new industry. There's a lot of understanding and risk management that's needed,"" Feroz said.
Despite growing interest in both digital currencies and the technology behind them, some big lenders have limited their customers ability to buy cryptocurrencies, fearing a plunge in their value will leave customers unable to repay debts. 
In February, British banks Lloyds (LON:LLOY) and Virgin Money (LON:VM) said they would ban credit card customers from buying cryptocurrencies, following the lead of JP Morgan and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C). 

Coinbase said it had also become the first crypto exchange to use Britain's Faster Payments Scheme, a network used by the traditional financial industry.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp (CIC) has sold its equity holding in Blackstone Group LP (N:BX), the U.S. private equity firm said in a filing, ending an 11-year investment. 
The original agreement with Beijing Wonderful Investments - the legal entity set up by CIC to invest in Blackstone - was struck in May 2007, just before the private equity firm's initial public offering a month later. 
The pact allowed the sovereign wealth fund to own up to 9.99 percent of the private equity firm. In 2008, the wealth fund raised its stake in Blackstone to 12.5 percent, Reuters reported at that time.
CIC's exit from Blackstone comes amid growing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington since U.S. President Donald Trump took office just over a year ago.
Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecoms sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said on Tuesday.
""As of February 22, 2018, Beijing Wonderful Investments no longer owned any non-voting common units,"" Blackstone said in its annual report filed with the securities regulator earlier this month. It did not give details.
Beijing-headquartered CIC told Reuters late on Wednesday it ""gradually divested"" its stake in Blackstone according to ""changes in the market"" and as part of ""a normal adjustment of its portfolio"".
The sovereign fund, whose assets had surpassed $800 billion by the end of 2016 thanks mainly to stronger returns from its overseas portfolios, said the firm achieved ""positive returns"" from its investment.
CIC and Blackstone continue to cooperate in real estate and hedge funds, as well as direct investments, it said.
A Blackstone spokesman said in a separate emailed statement on Wednesday that the U.S. private equity firm continues ""to expand this important relationship as one of CIC's major asset managers,"" despite the stake sale. 
The financial details of the stake sale were not immediately clear, and a person familiar with the matter said the sovereign fund had been gradually selling its shares over the last few years.

CIC, which was founded to help China boost returns on its foreign exchange reserves, had about a 4.5 percent stake in Blackstone at the end of last year, said the person, who declined to be named as the information is not public.

HERZOGENAURACH, Germany (Reuters) - Shares in German sportswear firm Adidas (DE:ADSGn) soared on Wednesday after it announced a big buyback, gave an upbeat outlook for 2018 and lifted its 2020 profitability forecast, while conceding it would be hard to match rival Nike's margins.
Adidas said late on Tuesday it plans to buy back up to 3 billion euros ($3.7 billion) of its shares, or almost 9 percent of its share capital, by 2021 on top of a higher-than-expected 2017 dividend of 2.60 euros per share.
The company's online sales leaped 57 percent in 2017 to 1.5 billion euros, or about 7 percent of sales.
The company's shares, which had fallen 15 percent in the past six months as sales growth cooled, were up 10 percent at 1206 GMT, the top gainer on Germany's blue-chip index <.GDAX>.
""(20)18 will be a good year for us...ensuring we get the right balance of market share growth and margin growth...to get us closer to where some of our competitors are,"" Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told a news conference.
After a tough few years, Adidas has returned to form under Rorsted, taking market share from bigger rival  Nike  (N:NKE) in North America and selling its underperforming TaylorMade golf and CCM Hockey brands.
Since taking over in 2016, Rorsted has put a sharper focus on improving profitability, which still lags Nike.
Finance chief Harm Ohlmeyer, who used to lead the Adidas ecommerce business, told the news conference it would be hard to close the gap completely given Nike's dominance of the U.S. market, but he said online sales were helping margins. 
Rosted said there was still huge potential to increase online sales further given that ecommerce accounts for about 15 to 20 percent of sales for the global sporting goods market. 
Adidas forecast currency-neutral sales would rise around 10 percent in 2018, with an operating margin of between 10.3 and 10.5 percent, up from 9.8 percent in 2017. Nike reported an operating margin of 13.8 percent for its 2016/17 fiscal year.
WORLD CUP BOOST
Adidas expects a boost from the 2018 soccer World Cup, although Rorsted noted that the event has less impact than before as soccer now accounts for less than 10 percent of sales. 
He said the company had no plans to boycott the tournament despite rising political tension between the West and Russia: ""Isolation is not the best way to resolution,"" he said.
Adidas lifted its forecast for the operating margin to hit 11.5 percent by 2020, up from a previous forecast of 11 percent. Rorsted highlighted steps to improve efficiency, such as more global purchasing, shared business services and fewer products.
Fourth-quarter sales rose 12 percent to 5.06 billion euros, missing analyst forecasts for 5.13 billion as sales in Russia and at its Reebok brand slipped.
It reported operating profit more than tripled to 132 million euros, beating analyst forecasts for 61 million, but recorded a net loss of 41 million after a tax impact of 76 million due to changes in the U.S. tax code.
Rorsted said a turnaround plan he launched for loss-making Reebok was bearing fruit, with the brand expected to return to growth in North America in 2018. 
""While the slowdown in organic growth is going to raise some questions today, confidence on the profitability progression implies a continued superior growth potential,"" said  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts, who rate the stock ""equal-weight"".

895,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 09:57AM ET</span>",Everything is going exactly right for one group of stocks poised to smash record highs,"When market sell-offs hit, it's usually the smaller, less liquid stocks that get hurt the most.
But last month, when the stock market suffered its first 10% correction in years, the opposite happened. Large-cap companies actually fell more than their small-cap counterparts, bucking conventional wisdom.
And if they didn't already have enough going for them, small-caps proceeded to beat their larger peers on the way back up. Now, the group's double dip of resilience and good fortune has it poised to shatter records.
So how did small-caps find themselves in this situation? The Bank of America Merrill Lynch equity strategist Dan Suzuki has identified three main drivers.
First, he notes that the relative illiquidity seen in small-caps actually benefited them during the early-February market meltdown, which was worsened by forced selling in volatility products. Since small-caps are more thinly traded, they weren't as vulnerable to sharp, sudden price movements.
Second, Suzuki highlights the new tax law as having an outsize positive impact on small-caps. He says the group, on average, paid higher taxes before the cuts and would therefore see a bigger profitability boost.
Third, he argues the escalating prospect of a global trade war will favor more domestically focused companies, such as small-caps. It's a dynamic that has already played out since President Donald Trump first announced tariffs on steel and aluminum, with small-caps outperforming broader indexes.
Beyond those three factors and looking forward, Suzuki says small-caps are more appealing on a valuation basis. He bases this on how much small-cap prices have contracted since November, noting that both mid- and large-cap indexes have seen more moderate pullbacks, making them expensive by comparison.
Don't believe Suzuki? Well, he has company on Wall Street, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) also espousing the positive characteristics of small-caps. In the weeks following February's 10% correction, Goldman highlighted small-caps as one of the two best stock market bets, on an investment-factor basis.
""We maintain our tactically bullish stance on small-caps over large-caps given the accelerating economic and corporate profit outlook,"" Suzuki wrote in a client note. ""The near-term risks appear firmly to the upside."""

898,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 05:18PM ET</span>","All Toys ""R"" Us shops to shut in Britain","(Reuters) - Toys ""R"" Us stores will disappear from Britain's shopping streets within six weeks, joint administrators for the retailer said on Wednesday, announcing plans to close the group's remaining 75 shops.
The administrators said in a statement they had not been able to find a buyer for all or part of the business, resulting in the loss of about 3,000 jobs.
The retailer's U.S. parent company is also suffering in its home market with reports it is preparing for potential liquidation, six months after filing for bankruptcy.
The toy chain, however, is working on a proposal that will keep about 200 U.S. stores open for business even after the liquidation, CNBC reported https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/14/toys-r-us-is-exploring-a-plan-that-could-keep-200-stores-open-even-after-liquidation.html, citing people familiar with the situation. 
The company is working on a plan where it could sell its stronger Toys R Us Canadian business, along with roughly 200 of its most profitable U.S. stores, to a new buyer, according to the report. 
Toys ""R"" Us declined to comment on the CNBC report. 
The toy store chain, which has 800 operating stores in the United States, is already in the process of closing about 180 of them. 
The UK arm of Toys ""R"" Us entered administration, a form of creditor protection, in February, sunk by weak consumer sentiment, the growth of online sales and currency swings as a result of Brexit.
In Britain, the administrators had been trying to sell parts of the business.
""This process attracted some interest, but ultimately no party has been able to move forward with a formal bid prior to the expiration of the stated deadline,"" joint administrator Simon Thomas, a partner at corporate advisory and restructuring firm Moorfields said in a statement. 
Seventy-five stores will be closed over the next six weeks, on top of the 25 outlets that have already closed or are about to shut under an earlier plan. 

The administrators said they remained open to interest from potential buyers.

The company said it has also withdrawn its slate of independent director nominees for Qualcomm's annual shareholder meeting.
Broadcom, however, expects to continue with its plan to redomicile to the United States.
""Although we are disappointed with this outcome, Broadcom will comply with the order,"" the chipmaker said.
Sources had told Reuters on Tuesday that Broadcom was ready to scrap its bid for Qualcomm.
Broadcom's board met late on Tuesday to formalize plans to move its base to the United States, at a cost of about $500 million a year under a higher tax rate, the sources said.
Being based in the United States as opposed to Singapore should make it easier for Broadcom to make acquisitions of U.S. companies without falling under the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).
Shares of Broadcom were untraded, while those of Qualcomm were up marginally before the opening bell.

The Japanese automaker and its partner  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) also named key members of senior management teams that will focus on deepening convergence in areas including engineering and purchasing, as the group seeks to leverage its combined scale to raise efficiencies and reduce costs.
The closer partnership comes as the two automakers discuss plans for a closer tie-up in which Nissan would acquire the bulk of the French state's 15 percent Renault holding, Reuters reported last week. 
Munoz, who previously led Nissan's strong growth in the United States, will replace Jun Seki, currently head of China operations. Seki becomes a senior vice president of production engineering, and will join a senior management team focused on increasing cooperation between Nissan and Renault in manufacturing and production operations.
Munoz will remain chief performance officer at Nissan.
The move follows Nissan's announcement last month that it and its Chinese joint venture partner Dongfeng Group plan to invest 60 billion yuan ($9.50 billion) in China over the next five years to boost sales volumes by more than 70 percent to 2.6 million vehicles a year by 2022.
The Nissan-Renault group's organizational change comes into effect on April 1, and is designed to accelerate cooperation between the two automakers and Mitsubishi Motors Corporation (T:7211). 
Hadi Zablit, who joins the alliance from Boston Consulting Group in Paris, will head a team dedicated to new transportation services, venture projects and the development of a manufacturing platform for ultra-compact cars to be shared across the group. 
His team will include Ogi Redzic, senior vice president of the alliance's connected vehicles and mobility services operations. 
Together, the three automakers plan to achieve annual synergies of 10 billion euros by 2022 while boosting global sales by roughly one-third to 14 million units by that date.

(Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed more than 250 points on Wednesday as U.S. manufacturers continued to suffer from concerns over the impact of new tariffs on trade.
Boeing's (N:BA) 4 percent fall contributed to about 100 points drop in the blue-chip index, with traders citing continuing fallout from Tuesday's reports that U.S. President Donald Trump could impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports.
""Governments in general are in a wait-and-see mode to find out what is going to be the outcome of the negotiations,"" said Paul Springmeyer, investment managing director at U.S. Bank Private Wealth Management.
The Trump administration is pressing China to cut its trade surplus with the United States by $100 billion, a White House spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
""There's every situation that's being looked at now, whether it's tariffs or not with a new eye, in terms of how one would deal with United States moving forward.""
Major U.S. manufacturers have been the heaviest hit since Trump trailered and then announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports earlier this month.
The issue overshadowed China's report that its factory output grew much faster than expected at the start of the year, suggesting the world's second largest economy may be picking up speed.
By 11:51 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was down 257.31 points, or 1.03 percent, at 24,749.72. The S&P 500 (SPX) fell 0.46 percent to 2,752.71 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 0.32 percent to 7,487.06.
The third straight monthly fall in retail sales pointed to slowing U.S. growth but cooled concerns of Federal Reserve raising interest rates at a faster pace in 2018.
Following the data, J.P. Morgan analysts lowered their first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimate to 2 percent from 2.5 percent.
Financial stocks (SPSY) fell 0.37 percent, tracking a decline in U.S. bond yields on the back of soft retail sales data.
Shares of department store operators Kohl's (N:KSS) fell 2.9 percent, while Macy's (N:M) and Nordstrom (N:JWN) dropped more than 1 percent. 
Shares in Qualcomm fell about 3 percent and those in rival Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) declined 0.5 percent after the Singapore-based chipmaker formally withdrew its bid for  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) but said it would pursue other targets.
Signet Jewelers (N:SIG) fell about 17 percent after the company reported lower same-store sales in the fourth quarter.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,454 to 1,293. On the Nasdaq, 1,506 issues fell and 1,197 advanced.

934,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 07:50AM ET</span>","A shadow of former self, RBS investment bank starts comeback","By Emma Rumney and Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - After a decade of deep cuts to rein in a division that nearly bankrupted its parent, Royal Bank of Scotland's (L:RBS) investment bank is attracting new business once again, according to executives and a review of industry data. 
The investment banking division, NatWest Markets, helped propel RBS's meteoric rise from a small Scottish lender to a behemoth with assets outstripping British GDP in 2008, almost derailing the economy when it emerged much of them were toxic. 
Since then the unit has slashed its product lines from 28 to three: interest-rate products; currencies; and financing, which helps corporate and institutional clients raise debt and acts as a market maker for their bonds. 
The investment bank is beefing up financing, the smallest of its three business areas, with one focus being rebuilding relationships with financial customers like banks or insurers that were lost when the bank yanked teams from a host of geographies. 
It has risen to eighth place in the league tables of euro-denominated bond sales for financial institutions in 2018 so far, according to Thomson Reuters data, up from 15th place in 2016 and 2017, and 20th in 2015. By comparison, the investment bank was in sixth place in 2008. 
Growth at NatWest Markets could be crucial for RBS, which relies on the unit for almost a tenth of its revenue, as it looks to restart dividends and faces a multi-billion-dollar settlement with U.S. authorities for mis-selling mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis.
Harsh Shah, who is leading the drive as head of financial institutions origination and solutions, told Reuters his team had been reopening dialogue with clients but declined to provide an example of where this had been successful. 
NatWest Markets' narrow, European focus diverges from the rest of the industry, which tends to also offer equities and services like M&A and have a more global reach. 
This proved an advantage over the past year, as it benefited from comparative volatility in sterling-denominated debt after the Brexit vote while the rest of the industry was struggling with subdued global markets.
But it is too early to predict the fortunes of the investment bank.
Its losses narrowed by almost 900 million pounds ($1.26 billion) in 2017 to 977 million pounds, but it is still wrestling with its past: restructuring and conduct costs accounted for almost 70 percent of that loss.
NatWest Markets is far from being back in the big league because it is now a sliver of the size of its rivals as a result of the cuts. Its 1.05 billion pounds in total revenue in 2017 is dwarfed by the 9.9 billion pounds at Barclays' investment bank (L:BARC) and $15.1 billion in net operating income at HSBC's (L:HSBA) investment bank.
'QUIETLY' GROWING
Once emblematic of RBS's penchant for risk taking and ill-judged expansion, culminating in the bank's 45.5 billion pound bailout in 2008, NatWest Markets' streamlined ambitions reflect its parent's drive to concentrate on key markets.
""It is starting to quietly grow market share again in the markets we like,"" RBS Chief Executive Ross McEwan said at the bank's annual results presentation last month in response to a question from Reuters on plans for NatWest Markets.
He added that there were no ""major"" plans for expansion. 
However NatWest Markets has made a small number of significant hires in financing, including Shah, who was hired in 2016, and two other senior people that were added to its financial institutions team last year. Its government and public organization debt team has also been expanded in recent months.
NatWest Markets acted as joint lead bookrunner or manager on 74 debt transactions by financial institutions last year, up from 49 in 2016, according to information compiled by financial data provider Dealogic and provided to Reuters by RBS. 
Even throughout the cuts, NatWest Markets maintained its role as a ""primary dealer"" for governments, tasked with buying their debt and selling it on to investors. It is a high-profile role that helps banks win other lucrative business in those countries. 
For example, after primary dealing for Greece throughout its crisis years, in recent months NatWest Markets has been appointed to manage bond sales by the National Bank of Greece, Eurobank Ergasias and Alpha Bank. 
Shah said future growth in its financial institutions business would come from a push into dollar-denominated deals, as well as ongoing strength in euros and sterling. 
""We're focused on growing market share further,"" he said.

Atlantia and ACS agreed to create a 7-billion-euro holding company in which the Italians will take 50 percent, plus one share, ACS will take 30 percent and Hochtief the remainder.
ACS said it would subscribe to a 6.43-million-share capital increase by Hochtief at 146.42 euros per share. It will then sell Hochtief shares to Atlantia worth up to 2.5 billion euros, giving the Italian group an almost 25 percent stake.

940,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",EU Commission proposes measures to speed up offloading of banks' bad loans,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday new measures to make banks set aside more money for new loans that turn bad and facilitate the offloading of the existing non-performing loans, in a move meant to reduce risks in the banking sector.
Under the proposal, banks will have two years to fully cover potential losses from new loans that are not backed by a collateral. 
For secured loans, lenders will have eight years to fully cover losses with gradual increases from a minimum 5 percent coverage in the first year to 27.4 percent in the fourth year and 75 percent in the seventh year.
""In case a bank does not meet the applicable minimum level, deductions from own funds would apply,"" a Commission document said.
The EU executive is also proposing measures to facilitate the offloading of the existing stock of bad loans that, although decreasing, still amount to 910 billion euros ($1.1 trillion), Commission data showed.
Under the Commission plan, which needs approval by EU states and lawmakers, banks in all 28 EU countries will be able to agree with corporate borrowers an accelerated out-of-court mechanism to recover the collateral in case loans turn bad.
This is meant to avoid lengthy judicial procedures that slow banks' recoveries in several EU countries.
The Commission is also proposing to further develop secondary markets for bad loans by creating a single EU market in a bid to increase the number of buyers of bad loans and raise their price closer to banks' valuations.
To further help lenders offload their bad debt, the Commission published non-binding guidelines to set up bad banks or asset management companies that would buy the loans, allowing lenders to focus on their core lending activities.
The guidance clarifies that state aid to set up these entities is allowed, but under precise conditions and as ""an exceptional solution"".
Governments could provide ""market-conform"" guarantees to securitize bad loans and can provide funds only if they operate as market agents, the Commission said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) will expand its grocery home delivery services to reach more than 40 percent of U.S. households, or 100 metro areas from an existing six, as the retailer steps up a fight against rival Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
The extra cost may hit Walmart's bottom line, but increased spending on grocery delivery is seen as essential in the fierce battle for online orders for food and household staples.
""It is an absolutely necessary step for them to take in terms of their ability to compete with Amazon in particular,"" said Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics.
Walmart said on Wednesday the service would be rolled out by the end of the year. Deliveries will cost $9.95 with a minimum $30 order and companies like Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] will provide transport. Other delivery companies will be added later this year.
The move will complement Walmart's rollout of curbside grocery pickup, which is currently available in 1,200 stores and will be added to a 1,000 more stores this year. It also allows Walmart to compete with Amazon's two-hour Prime Now service for shoppers of its loyalty program.
The expanded service should help the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer to get more of its store shoppers to buy items online, where they spend twice as much. 
Intense competition is sweeping the grocery market, following Amazon‚Äôs purchase of Whole Foods last year.
Rivals are also expanding delivery options. Amazon recently debuted free two-hour Prime Now grocery delivery from Whole Foods in four cities, free for its annual $99 Prime subscribers.
 Kroger Co  (N:KR), the nation's largest supermarket operator, has home delivery from more than 872 stores across the United States, and this week expanded its partnership with delivery company Instacart.
Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market, mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts.
Walmart is No. 2 with 9 percent, followed by Ahold USA's (AS:AD) Peapod with 7 percent, FreshDirect with 6 percent and Instacart at 5 percent.

Online revenue growth slowed at Walmart in the most recent quarter, causing some analysts to question its strategy to compete with Amazon. Company officials said Walmart was still on track to increase its e-commerce sales by 40 percent this year.

TOKYO (Reuters) - KKR & Co (N:KKR) is selling its first yen bond, seeking to raise around $280 million in a deal to price on Thursday, bankers close to the deal told Thomson Reuters DealWatch.
The U.S. private equity firm is selling 30 billion yen ($281.58 million) worth of five-, seven- and 20-year debt in securities targeted at Japanese investors, said the bankers. Overseas regulations will be applicable to the securities.
A KKR representative declined to comment. The bankers asked not to be identified because they are not in a position to speak to media.
The firm is likely to keep the bond proceeds in yen and wants to become a regular issuer of debt in the Japanese currency, one banker said. Bankers declined to discuss why the firm is raising money in Japan, but KKR has been expanding its Japanese operations.
Last year it bought two units from Hitachi Ltd (T:6501) in deals worth about $3 billion, as the conglomerate tries to streamline operations.
KKR bid for the chip unit of Toshiba Corp (T:6502) but lost out to a consortium led by rival Bain Capital.
Mizuho Securities and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc are managing the sale.
KKR has about $5 billion bonds outstanding, none in yen, according to Thomson Reuters data.

LONDON (Reuters) - In the face of a fresh protectionist move from the United States causing Asian shares to fall overnight, European stocks managed a modest gain on Wednesday thanks to strong results from Adidas and robust mining stocks. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 0.2 percent, pushed higher by consumer staples and basic materials. Spain's IBEX (IBEX) lagged peers, down 0.5 percent after disappointing results from Zara fashion chain owner  Inditex . 
German sports fashion company Adidas (DE:ADSGn) shone at the top of the STOXX, jumping 8.6 percent after announcing a share buyback of up to 3 billion euros and lifting its 2020 profitability target.
Berenberg analysts said strong sales growth surprised the market after ""a lot of chatter"" about the stock recently.
""Despite the wide-ranging concerns, adidas has delivered a good set of results,"" said Berenberg's Zuzanna Pusz, adding that the share buyback program showed adidas' focus on shareholder returns.
Technology stocks were the biggest drag on the index after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports, targeting tech and telecommunications in particular. 
""We have got some protection in portfolios, which is a nod to the fact we think sentiment is totally overrun and valuations are very high,"" said Rory McPherson, head of investment strategy at Psigma Investment Management.
""Clearly the potential trade war would cause us to ramp up that protection, but at the moment we think it's a tail event.""
Basic resource stocks (SXPP) climbed 1.1 percent after data showed Chinese industrial production expanded at a much faster pace than expected. 
On the flipside of the retail sector to adidas, Zara owner Inditex (MC:ITX) was the top Spanish faller, down 2.6 percent after its results. UBS analysts said the dividend was lower than expected. 
German chemicals firm Symrise (DE:SY1G) tumbled 6 percent after 2017 results disappointed the market with slow margin growth.
Peer Brenntag (DE:BNRGn) also dropped after results.
UK insurer  Prudential  (L:PRU) was a notable gainer, up 5 percent as investors cheered its plan to spin off its British and European business.
Top faller was Belgian postal service Bpost (BR:BPOST) which dropped 18.7 percent after delivering a weak profit guidance for 2018. 
German online advertising firm  Axel Springer  (DE:SPRGn) tumbled 4.5 percent after Berenberg analysts cut their rating on the stock to ""sell"", saying the company was not delivering as much as digital peers. 
Psigma's McPherson has a neutral position on European equities and slightly underweight on the UK, while his biggest underweight is U.S. stocks. ""None of them are screamingly cheap,"" he said, adding U.S. stock valuations are much higher.
Analysts expect earnings to grow around 20 percent this year in the United States, while expectations for European earnings growth are around half that, Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data shows. 
""To deliver on those earnings is much more achievable,"" said McPherson.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 06:01AM ET</span>","South Korea fuel oil imports soar as coal, nuclear plants shut","By Roslan Khasawneh and Jane Chung
SINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's move to shut coal-fired generators to control air pollution at the same time as nuclear reactors are going into scheduled maintenance is resulting in surging fuel oil imports, as utilities burn the dirty feedstock to meet power demand.
South Korea's trade ministry said in February it would suspend five coal-fired power plants, with a combined capacity of 2.32 gigawatts (GW), from March to June, part of a broad campaign to reduce pollution.
That plan may backfire, at least in the short-term. A cold winter has raised power and heating demand, forcing utilities to burn more fuel oil in order to meet demand.
A by-product of the crude oil refining process, fuel oil's biggest use ahead of power generation is as a shipping fuel.
""In the near-term, fuel oil imports will increase to make up for the shortfall in coal-fired generation capacity,"" said Pat Markey, managing director of consultancy Sierra Vista Resources.
Fuel oil imports by power producers into Asia's fourth largest economy have jumped to 200,000 tonnes in March so far, up from 92,000 tonnes in February, tender data compiled by Reuters showed. 
First-quarter fuel oil imports are expected at 417,000 tonnes, up 28 percent from a year ago and already more than 60 percent of the 660,000 tonnes taken for all of last year. 
Burning fuel oil for power results in lower carbon dioxide emissions than coal-fired plants, but releases more toxic particles into the air. 
""Pollutants generated during combustion of fuel oils are nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, greenhouse gases, volatile compounds (like unburned hydrocarbons) and toxic trace metals,"" according to the U.S. Commission for Environmental Cooperation.
An official from a South Korean state-owned utility, said the increased fuel oil demand was partly a result of the government's decision to halt coal-fired plants temporarily due to pollution and reduced nuclear power because of planned maintenance. 
The official, who declined to be identified as he is not unauthorized to speak to the media, said some 110,000 tonnes of fuel oil would¬†be needed in April. 
Only two of South Korea's major utilities, Korea East-West Power Co Ltd (EWP) and Korea Western Power Co (WP), issue tenders for fuel oil for power generation, mostly during peak summer and winter demand, data on Thomson Reuters Eikon shows. 
The two utilities declined to comment. 
Coal power generates about 40 percent of South Korea's total electricity needs, nuclear around 30 percent, and natural gas meets 20 percent. The rest comes from oil and renewables. 
Even with the increase in fuel oil purchases, South Korea will have to raise imports of other fuels to meet demand as nearly half of its nuclear power plants are down for maintenance. 

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is the most likely to fill the gaps. Thomson Reuters Eikon data shows South Korea's LNG shipments reached nearly 12 million tonnes between January and March 14, up 1.5 percent from the first quarter of last year.

962,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 05:32AM ET</span>",Qualcomm Outspent Broadcom About 100 to 1 in Washington Lobbying,"(Bloomberg) -- Well before Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. confronted a hostile takeover bid from Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd., the San Diego-based chipmaker laid the groundwork for support in Washington by outspending its rival by nearly 100 to 1.
Qualcomm spent $8.3 million in 2017, while Broadcom spent $85,000, according to federal lobbying disclosures. Qualcomm disclosed spending on issues including immigration, international trade, taxes and antitrust, among others, showing how it amassed clout in Washington. It‚Äôs unclear how much of Qualcomm‚Äôs money paid for lobbying against Broadcom‚Äôs bid.
Qualcomm spent about $2 million a quarter, according to the disclosures, increasing slightly in the fourth quarter. Broadcom‚Äôs unwanted advances started in November. Qualcomm‚Äôs widespread lobbying operation marked a sharp contrast with the effort made by Singapore-based Broadcom, which instead sought to curry favor with President Donald Trump and offered to move its headquarters to the U.S. That was in exchange for winning approval for its purchase of Brocade Communications Systems Inc., a substantially smaller deal.
Cornyn Concerns
Senator John Cornyn of Texas is sponsoring a bill to expand the authority of a national security panel to further restrict foreign investments viewed as threats. In February, he wrote to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin saying Broadcom‚Äôs bid to win control of Qualcomm‚Äôs board at a March shareholders meeting should be examined by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., according to a copy of the letter obtained by Bloomberg.
Treasury chairs the secretive CFIUS panel, which reviews acquisitions of American firms by foreign investors for national security concerns. Six House Republicans sent another letter to Mnuchin March 1, also citing national security risks raised by the deal. Cornyn‚Äôs office continued to pressure Treasury, noting that his bill, which has bipartisan and full administration support, would put the Broadcom deal under CFIUS jurisdiction without question, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Cornyn has been concerned about the national security implications of foreign investment, with China his primary focus, for some time. FEC records show that neither Qualcomm‚Äôs employees nor its PAC have been big donors to Cornyn. He‚Äôs received $12,000 in campaign contributions from them since 2007, a small fraction of the $26.3 million he raised over the same period.
Pressure Campaign
The second-most powerful Senate Republican and six House Republicans came to Qualcomm‚Äôs defense in the nick of time. The pressure campaign set an unprecedented chain of events into motion, prompting a CFIUS order last week to postpone Qualcomm‚Äôs shareholder vote and culminating with President Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order blocking the deal Monday.
Broadcom and Qualcomm declined to comment on their lobbying around the deal.
Just months earlier, Trump had feted Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan at the White House, calling his company ""a really great, great company"" in announcing Broadcom‚Äôs decision to move its headquarters from Singapore to the U.S.
As CFIUS moved to delay Qualcomm‚Äôs shareholder vote, Broadcom sped up its plan to move its headquarters to April from May. That would make Broadcom a U.S. company and sidestep CFIUS‚Äôs authority. It proved to be too little, too late. Just hours after Tan met with U.S. officials at the Pentagon Monday seeking to salvage the deal, Trump issued the order blocking it.
White House Access
Broadcom‚Äôs access to the president may have led it to underestimate what was needed to win the approval process. When CFIUS came after it, Broadcom launched a last-ditch legal and public relations campaign to try to win support for the deal. Late last week, the company signed S-3 Group, a Republican-allied public affairs and lobbying firm, to help bolster its case, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Broadcom was already working with its own roster of Washington insiders on the deal, including CFIUS expert Ted Kassinger of O‚ÄôMelveny & Meyers LLP, a former deputy secretary and senior adviser at the Commerce Department. Broadcom had also enlisted communications firms CLS Strategies and Beacon Global Strategies.
Top-100 Spender
Qualcomm, which has been a top-100 lobbying spender in every quarter since the end of 2014, had 19 more lobbyists at the end of last year than the year before, including three former members of Congress, according to a Bloomberg Government analysis. Qualcomm also spent more than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM). last year.
Broadcom spent most of its $85,000 last year on a Republican strategist based south of Austin, Texas, who was the company‚Äôs only active lobbyist in the fourth quarter after Broadcom hired him in October. Three more lobbyists at another firm did less than $5,000 worth of lobbying work on intellectual property disputes earlier in the year, according to the disclosures. Before that, the company hadn‚Äôt disclosed any federal lobbying since mid-2014.
While Broadcom‚Äôs Tan has won plaudits from investors for his thriftiness, this time it may have cost him his prize as Washington turned against him. The failure to anticipate and navigate the city‚Äôs changing political currents tripped up Broadcom, just as it was on the cusp of winning the takeover battle. Its nominees for Qualcomm‚Äôs board were ahead in proxy voting before CFIUS halted that process and Monday‚Äôs White House order removed them from the nomination slate.
Lobbying strength won‚Äôt solve all of Qualcomm‚Äôs problems. The chipmaker is facing an antitrust investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which is looking into whether it illegally used its strength in mobile phone chips to charge hefty licensing fees. That action mirrors similar moves around the world by other governments that have cost Qualcomm more than $4 billion in fines.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 11:28AM ET</span>",Volkswagen brand says profitability drive faces climate cost risks,"WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) core VW autos division said on Wednesday that EU requirements on curbing emissions and other climate-related demands would cause profitability to stall between 2018 and 2020.
Profits would be hit even as earnings, sales and deliveries at the German firm were forecast to hit new records this year, VW brand executives told a media briefing.
The European Union has proposed tougher vehicle emissions targets for 2025 and 2030 to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. Carmakers, which are racing to develop electric vehicles (EVs), can be fined for violating the limits.
The VW brand shoulders the bulk of Volkswagen group's development spending, as well as costs related to the ""dieselgate"" emissions scandal.
VW finance chief Arno Antlitz said VW faced ""heavy financial demands"" due to bottlenecks expected from introducing so-called WLTP lab tests related to car emissions and fuel consumption, regulations to curb CO2 emissions and EV development costs.
""The CO2 fleet targets will certainly pose the greatest challenge for us as a company until the year 2020,"" VW brand chief executive Herbert Diess said.
Carmakers are working on new EV models to meet emissions goals. VW aims to sell more than 1 million cars powered solely by batteries by 2025, after selling just 43,000 electric models in 2017. 
The VW brand, Volkswagen's largest division by sales and revenue, more than doubled its return on sales to 4.1 percent on the back of cuts in research and development spending, lower production costs and rising sales of sport utility vehicles, which deliver higher margins.
The carmaker said its operating margin might come in between 4 and 5 percent this year, a range it said it would also maintain in 2020, the year before a new lower limit of 95 grams of CO2 per km takes effect.
""This year and over the next few years, the brand will face severe challenges despite its improved competitiveness,"" VW said.
But Diess said VW expected to benefit from further cost savings, expansion of modular production and growing demand for its new vehicle models in the Americas.

HONG KONG (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) has called on Hong Kong to reconsider planned limits on how much equity company founders can hold when the city introduces dual-class shares, warning they could dent the city's competitiveness versus major centers like New York.
The new rules, due to take effect by mid-year, are designed to give greater voting rights to founding shareholders as part of efforts to attract Chinese tech and other new economy firms as Hong Kong seeks to counter New York's success in attracting headline-grabbing Chinese companies.
But under the proposals company founders seeking a dual-class listing cannot hold more than 50 percent of the firm when it floats. 
Ken Hitchner, chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs' Asia-Pacific operations told a regulatory conference that ""not limiting the amount of equity that founders can hold at the time of an IPO"" could help attract more Chinese companies to the Hong Kong market.
""There will likely be innovative companies looking to go public where the founder owns 80% or 90%. If that founder wanted to do a dual-class listing in Hong Kong, he or she would have to sell down to 50 per cent,"" Hitchner told Reuters separately.
""That doesn't seem in line with what Hong Kong is trying to do here and it could hurt competitiveness versus New York.""
Notwithstanding Hong Kong's role as the world's biggest equity capital-raising center for four of the last 10 years, it has fallen well behind New York, its arch-rival, in the battle for hot tech stocks and other growth sectors. Just 3 percent of Hong Kong listings in the past decade, by market value, have been so-called ""new economy"" companies, compared with 47 percent for the New York Stock Exchange, according to a discussion paper published by the HKEX in June.
EYES ON GOVERNANCE
Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HK:0388), the city‚Äôs bourse, is currently consulting on the detailed rules for introducing dual class shares, which will upend a strict 30-year adherence to a one-share-one-vote principle and has upset corporate governance advocates.
Hong Kong is hoping that easing rules for primary listing of companies with dual-class shares will help revitalize its IPO market, which has been dominated by Chinese state firms, financial companies and property groups.
Hong Kong's rules are also being closely watched by governance experts for the safeguards and limits the city includes.
While New York, which has allowed dual-class shares for decades and operates a system based on extensive disclosures of share structures, Hong Kong has typically included tougher rule-based protections for minority shareholders.
""The US, which is the major competitor, doesn't actually have any rules - it‚Äôs a rules-free situation there,"" said Ashley Alder, chief executive of the Securities and Futures Commission, speaking at the same conference, which was organized by the SFC. ""What Hong Kong is about to implement is basically the world's first set of rules for weighted voting rights."" Bankers have largely backed dual-class shares and report potential listing candidates are actively debating the proposed system.
""These are real discussions in the bake offs, in the pitches that we're involved in,"" said Goldman's Hitchner.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Prudential  (L:PRU) is to spin off its British and European business from its international operations, breaking up the 170-year-old insurer to refocus on faster-growing markets in the sector's latest major shake-up.
British insurers have been changing strategy to reduce exposure to capital-intensive products following the introduction of rigorous European solvency rules two years ago, while also seeking ways to deal with growing fee pressure.
Prudential said it is splitting off savings and investment-focused M&G Prudential, which will be based in London, leaving Prudential plc focused on life insurance and asset management in the rapidly expanding markets of Asia and Africa and the United States, which is less tightly regulated than Europe.
Its shares were up 5.1 percent to 19.19 pounds at 1027 GMT on Wednesday, taking it to the top of the FTSE 100 index. 
The international business will also remain headquartered and listed in London and be led by chief executive Mike Wells.
""We're not looking to get rid of all of our capital-intensive products, we're looking to grow the piece that's capital-light,"" Wells said of M&G Prudential, adding that it would be ""competing domestically"" for people and capital.
Prudential will also move the legal entity for its Hong Kong insurance subsidiaries to Asia from Britain, further reducing exposure to European capital rules. 
The industry is wrestling with the rising cost of regulation and pressure on fund management fees and Prudential's move follows Standard Life's (L:SLA) merger with Aberdeen Asset Management in 2017 which led to the sale of the bulk of its insurance business to Phoenix Group (L:PHNX) last month. 
Anglo-South African financial services group  Old Mutual  (L:OML) is also in the midst of a four-way split.
""Imitation is the greatest form of flattery,"" Old Mutual chairman Patrick O'Sullivan said of the Prudential announcement. 
(Graphic: Britain's largest insurer Prudential outperforms rivals - http://reut.rs/2Hyvl7j)
FTSE FIXTURES 
Once the proposed split is complete, Prudential said it expects both companies to be big enough to feature on Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 stock index and it is not planning to sell any of the British business, Wells told a media call.
One banker told Reuters a bid for M&G Prudential was unlikely before the deal completes, while two major shareholders welcomed the plan.
Ben Ritchie, senior investment manager at top-15 shareholder Aberdeen Standard Investments, told Reuters that M&G Prudential was likely to have good cashflow and would be capable of paying a reasonably high and recurring dividend.
John Foley, who heads M&G Prudential, will steer that business through the demerger and investors will hold shares in both when the spin-off is completed, although the timing has not yet been set. 
As well as the demerger, Prudential disclosed the sale of a 12 billion-pound UK annuities book to Rothesay Life. M&G Prudential still has around 20 billion pounds in annuities, Foley said, but was not planning to sell more.

Prudential also posted results for 2017, which showed a 6 percent rise in operating profit to 4.7 billion pounds, beating market expectations of 4.6 billion pounds.

976,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 01:10AM ET</span>","In hunt for yield, Japan insurers bet on project finance","By Taiga Uranaka
TOKYO (Reuters) - Project finance investment by Japan's top insurers jumped nearly fivefold in the year to the end of March as they sought higher returns after years of persistently low interest rates.
Their¬†foray into the $230 billion global loan market for infrastructure and energy projects underscores¬†the¬†challenge they face. Years of massive economic stimulus in Japan¬†has¬†suppressed yields on¬†the insurers' staple investment diet¬†of¬†Japanese government bonds (JGBs).
Reuters calculations¬†based on data provided by the companies¬†show that project finance investment by Japan's top four life insurers¬†has jumped nearly fivefold in the financial year¬†to March 31 to about 160 billion yen ($1.5 billion).
The four are Nippon Life Insurance Co, which made up the bulk of the overall project finance dealmaking, Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co (T:8750), Meiji Yasuda Life and Sumitomo Life.
Lenders in project finance rely on cash generated by the projects for returns, making it a riskier investment than conventional corporate loans.
Shinji Kuge, general manager at Nippon Life Insurance Co's structured finance department, said project finance does ""take time and effort. But returns in proportion to risks taken are good.""
He said average project finance loans have margins of 150-200 basis points over benchmark LIBOR rate, or London inter-bank offered rate (LIBOR).
That would compare with single-digit basis-point margins over LIBOR on typical corporate loans, industry officials said, and a 30-year JGB currently yielding just 0.76 percent.
As Japan's largest private-sector life insurer, with $700 billion in assets, Nippon Life has committed to about 10 overseas project finance deals totaling 120 billion yen¬†this¬†financial year.¬†They include a A$176 million loan to a desalination project in Australia.
Dai-ichi Life, Japan's second-largest¬†private-sector¬†life insurer has been investing in overseas project finance since 2014. This financial year though, it is participating for the first time in project finance loans in primary syndication, as opposed to buying existing loans in secondary market.
""Given tight credit spreads, we are looking for fields where not many investors have entered yet,"" said Akinao Nishio, general manager at Dai-ichi Life structured finance group.
Its deals include loans to the UK High Speed 1 railway line project, a 109-km (68-mile) high-speed rail line to connect London's St Pancras International station with the Channel Tunnel linking Britain and France.
The insurer has announced four project finance deals totaling about 25 billion yen ($236 million)¬†this¬†financial year. New deals are¬†likely to be closed soon, Dai-ichi officials said.
A¬†Sumitomo Life spokesman¬†said the company was diversifying its investments.
""We would like to step up efforts in the area,"" he said.
A Meiji Yasuda Life spokesman¬†said ""secondary deals are likely to be our main focus in the next financial year (starting in April) but we would consider primary deals if there are good ones.""
Insurers do not disclose their annual investments but their financial statements show their total portfolio allocation. The biggest portion of their funds remains in Japanese bonds at 30-40 percent.

Nippon Life has said its overall investment portfolio in the current financial year is likely to increase by about 1.5 trillion yen, out of which 120 billion yen is being directed to project finance.

977,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 04:48AM ET</span>",Corporate America's undertakers prepare for feast after lean years,"By Jessica DiNapoli
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the era of cheap money gradually draws to a close and rising inflation and interest rates cast a shadow over Wall Street's nine-year bull market, one corner of the financial industry is cheering.
Debt restructuring experts are gearing up for a pickup in business, expecting more debt defaults and more financial stress in general ahead, an ominous sign for investors already rattled by last month's stock market sell-off.
Restructuring advisors at several firms told Reuters they were more optimistic now than at any time since the 2008 financial crisis, and have started preparing for a wave of debt overhauls that could begin in earnest as early as 2019 and last for years.
""We are recruiting heavily, junior people, MBAs, operational people... We are seeing significant growth and significant hiring,"" said Lisa Donahue, global leader of the turnaround and restructuring practice at consulting firm AlixPartners LLP. 
That confidence reflects the view that rising interest rates will make it harder for struggling companies to borrow more or roll over their debt, as the era of abundant cheap credit fueled by the Federal Reserve's zero-rate policy and its asset buying draws to a close.
Restructuring professionals also point to outflows from the junk bond market, a key funding source for less creditworthy borrowers, and creeping inflation, which slowly results in an across-the-board rise in costs for companies. U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs announced earlier this month could exacerbate these inflationary fears. 
At one of the corporate restructuring industry's biggest annual gatherings last month in Las Vegas, many participants spoke of reaching a turning point after several lean years.
""I think it's starting to turn,"" Michael Goodman, managing director at investment bank SSG Capital Advisors LLC, told Reuters after the conference of the Turnaround Management Association and the Commercial Finance Association.
""In the last five years, if companies had a credit issue, they solved the problem with new debt. They won't be able to do that anymore, and the outcomes are debt restructurings and (distressed) sales,"" he said.
This optimism stands in stark contrast with the apprehension in other parts of Wall Street. Investment bankers advising companies on mergers and acquisitions have been cheering on the buoyant markets as good for their business. For restructuring specialists, however, the years of cheap credit were the lean times.
As companies took advantage of record-low borrowing costs to refinance hundreds of billions of dollars in junk-rated corporate debt in the last six years, the number of announced debt restructuring deals nearly halved to 144 deals last year from 282 in 2009, according to Thomson Reuters data.
(Graphic: U.S. restructuring market since the recession. http://tmsnrt.rs/2FjHhMz )
There is no industry-wide employment data, but membership in professional associations tumbled. The number of the Turnaround Management Association members fell 23 percent to 6,190 in 2016 from its peak in 2009, according to its most recent data.
The Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Advisors saw its membership plunge by 40 percent to 1,403 last year from its high in 2010. 
While those numbers have yet to recover, a pickup in enrollment in professional courses is an early sign that the industry is on the mend.
Tom Morrow, who is executive director of the Association of Insolvency and Restructuring Advisors, and one of the top providers of training courses for the industry, said attendance jumped by 28 percent last year to 299 students, recovering from a post-recession trough.
""Firms are starting to hire again,"" he said.
STRAIN BEGINS TO SPREAD 
The industry made it through the lean times thanks energy sector debt defaults brought by a 2014 slump in oil prices followed by a wave of retail bankruptcies caused by the rise in online shopping and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's expansion. 
Now signs of strain begin to emerge in other sectors. Community hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc saddled with about $14 billion in debt, faces significant annual maturities over the next few years, as interest rates begin to rise. Miner Murray Energy Corp, which weathered a rout in coal prices, has seen its 2021 bonds dip nearly 20 percent from earlier this year to about 44 cents on the dollar.
In another promising sign for the restructuring business, U.S.-based junk bond funds have been experiencing net outflows for eight straight weeks, the longest such streak since 2007. So far this year, outflows have reached $13.73 billion, up from only $743 million a year ago. 
The average yield on junk bonds has risen to 6.2 percent from 5.4 percent in October 2017, though that is still below the double-digit levels seen in February 2016 after the energy market rout, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) data.
To be sure, not all ailing companies will be on the hook right away. While some, such as Claire's Stores Inc, face significant debt maturities in 2019, other have refinanced their debt pushing payments as far back as 2024 and 2025, according to Eric Rosenthal, senior director of leveraged finance at Fitch.
However, some already seek help in revamping their businesses to avoid a full-blown debt crisis later on.

""There is a willingness to say 'hey, we need to get out in front of the curve, we need to make sure we are not the example in our industry that doesn't make it,'"" said Brian Fox, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal Holdings LLC, which serves as operational consultants.

The ad hoc group of creditors that signed a binding restructuring support agreement holds 46 percent of its senior debt, Noble Group said in a Singapore stock exchange filing Wednesday.  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) has also signed up to the plan, while ING Bank NV is in process of acceding to it. Both lenders own 4 percent of the senior claims, it said.
With the agreement in hand, Noble Group could solicit consent from other senior creditors. The ad hoc group is in talks with another batch of creditors holding about 15 percent of its senior claims, who have indicated their broad support for the plan, the filing shows. Noble Group has also improved the terms for shareholders and perpetual note holders after their opposition to the deal.
The agreement marks a step toward survival for Noble Group, which is teetering on the brink of collapse in a saga that started three years ago when then-unknown Iceberg Research began publishing critiques of its accounting.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Commodities merchant Noble Group (SI:NOBG) has finalised a restructuring agreement with a group of senior creditors holding 46 percent of its debt, and is in talks with others, as it races to launch a deal crucial to its survival. 
The embattled firm has been negotiating a $3.4 billion debt-for-equity swap for months, after selling billions of dollars of assets, taking hefty writedowns and cutting hundreds of jobs over the past three years. 
Singapore-listed Noble, once Asia's biggest commodity trader, also said it would move its ""center of main interests from Hong Kong to the United Kingdom,"" to support the restructuring. It did not provide details. 
Noble's Restructuring Support Agreement (RSA) has been signed by creditors known as the Ad Hoc Group and the firm is seeking support from another senior creditor,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), and trade finance provider, ING Bank, Noble said in a statement on Wednesday.
Joseph Swanson, senior managing director at Houlihan Lokey, financial advisor to the Ad Hoc Group, said the signing of the RSA was a landmark moment for Noble, and the Ad Hoc Group was looking forward to getting consent from creditors outside the core group. 
Noble said the Ad Hoc Group was also in contact with other senior creditors who were holding an additional 15 percent of claims and had indicated their broad support for the deal.
Noble is seeking to halve its senior debt and hand over 70 percent of the restructured business to the Ad Hoc Group. It said on Wednesday that existing equity holders could be diluted to 15 percent, marking an improvement for equity holders from earlier discussions of the deal. Company management could end up owning 15 percent. 
Noble's debt restructuring deal has been opposed by some bondholders and shareholders such as Goldilocks Investment Co, an Abu Dhabi Financial Group equity fund.
IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication, reported that the restructuring proposal requires a vote of senior creditors holding at least 75 percent of its debt, of which 75 percent must vote in favor for the measure to pass. 
Founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who rode a commodities bull run to build one of the world's biggest traders, Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its books. Noble has defended its accounting.
Noble's market value has fallen to just S$217 million ($166 million) from $6 billion in February 2015. The company has a $379 million bond that matures on March 20.
The company said its move to the United Kingdom would facilitate an alternative restructuring if one is needed.
Noble said Deutsche Bank has signed the RSA, and ING Bank was in the process of signing it. Together, they represent 4 percent of Noble's claims. 
Noble plans to launch its restructuring this month and said senior creditors keen to participate in the trade financing deal had to sign up by April 6.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. airlines will carry an all-time high number of passengers this spring, an industry trade group forecast on Wednesday, as increased competition and persistently lower fares make flying more accessible to the general public. 
Airlines for America (A4A) said it expects carriers to fly 150.7 million passengers, 2.47 million per day, between March 1 and April 30, in a 4 percent increase from the year-ago period.
Despite a number of seasonal challenges, including a rash of late-winter storms, U.S. airlines are generally off to a successful start of 2018, with some carriers having raised their first-quarter outlooks in the last week based on better-than-expected performance. 
""An expanding economy, employment gains and surging household net worth are also contributing to the growth in demand for air travel,"" A4A Chief Economist John Heimlich said in a statement. 

The seasonal period includes several potential travel peaks, including U.S. college spring breaks, Easter and Passover.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Corp said on Wednesday it is likely to resume paying corporate tax in Australia only in 2021, after recouping billions of dollars in investments made in the country in the past decade.
The oil giant was grilled at an Australian Senate hearing on tax avoidance, after having paid no tax since 2013, despite reporting billions of dollars in income from operations in the country. The hearing is part of a broader inquiry in corporate tax avoidance in resource-rich Australia.
The country's tax authorities are battling major miners BHP Billiton (LON:BLT) and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) as well as oil and gas giants over booking income in countries like the Netherlands and Singapore, where tax rates are lower.
""The only reason we're not paying tax at the moment is because we just invested A$21 billion ($16.5 billion),"" ExxonMobil Australia Chairman Richard Owen told the Senate panel.
The company said it is in a tax loss position in Australia as it soaks up the cost of investing heavily in new gas production in the Bass Strait and the huge Gorgon gas project off Western Australia, both ramping up since 2017.
It expects to start paying A$600 million a year in corporate tax from 2021, the company's tax manager, Stuart Brown, said. Gorgon is unlikely to start paying petroleum resource rent tax until the mid-2030s, he said.
However, over the past decade ExxonMobil Australia had an effective tax rate of more than 50 cents in every dollar, including income tax and the petroleum resource rent tax.
ExxonMobil is undergoing an Australian tax audit regarding one inter-company, or related party, loan. But even if the Australian Taxation Office prevails in the dispute, it would have a ""very, very small impact on our tax losses"", Brown said.
The government won a landmark case against  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) last year over a contested tax bill of A$340 million ($267 million) stemming from a related party loan at an abnormally high interest rate that lowered the oil giant's taxable income in Australia.
ExxonMobil said the facts in its loan under audit were very different from Chevron's. Interest rates on the loan were set at around 3-5 percent, it said.
The Senate probe into corporate tax avoidance, which began in 2014, is due to issue a final report by the end of May.

However, the increase is less than the 3,000 yen demanded by its union. Toyota, considered a bellwether in the country's annual wage negotiations, will announce the figures later on Wednesday.
A Toyota spokeswoman declined to say by how much the automaker planned to raise workers' monthly pay, but added it was considering raising wages and other benefits, such as family allowances, so that all unionized workers would on average get a 3.3 percent -- or 11,700 yen -- boost in monthly payment.
Big Japanese companies will announce annual wage hikes on Wednesday, and while workers will probably get more than last year's 2 percent, and possibly the most in years, they will likely fall short of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's goal of a 3 percent hike.
The results of the ""shunto"" spring wage negotiations between corporate managements and unions, announced by the big automobile and electronics companies, will set the tone for wage hikes across the nation and could provide hints about future consumer spending. 
Abe has been campaigning for a 3 percent gain to spur consumption and banish the deflation that has dogged Japan's economy for nearly two decades. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has also urged a 3 percent raise to nudge up inflation to the BOJ's long elusive 2 percent target.

985,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 09:31PM ET</span>",Goldman's Solomon sets out to prove bank's revenue engine can roar again,"By Catherine Ngai and Greg Roumeliotis
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Before  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) operating chief David Solomon takes the next step in his career, the 56-year-old banker will have to prove that a strategy he has championed to increase annual revenue by $5 billion can actually work.
Solomon, who is now effectively the chief executive officer-in-waiting after his rival in the succession race decided to leave the Wall Street bank, is trying to get dealmakers and traders to work together to produce more revenue. He is also pushing for growth in businesses like asset management and consumer lending, where Goldman does not have a long track record of success.
Since the strategy was unveiled in September, Wall Street has been rife with skepticism that Goldman, whose annual revenues have remained stuck below $40 billion since 2010, can make it happen. Analysts have repeatedly questioned management's underlying assumptions for the $5 billion target in research reports and on public conference calls.
Privately, many bankers and traders scoff at the idea that Solomon can get competing sides of the house to cooperate.
""I have been with Goldman for 20 years and have been hearing this idea for as long as I have been here,"" one dealmaker told Reuters about the cross-selling plan. ""I never in my 23 years here been asked by a client to be introduced to our stock brokers,"" said an investment banker at a rival firm.
Like several others, those bankers spoke about Solomon and the revenue strategy he helped engineer on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.
But associates who spoke to Reuters about Solomon described a direct, decisive leader who has proven he can convince clients to do more business with Goldman Sachs, and who can also get a team motivated behind an untested strategy. 
For instance, as co-head of Goldman's investment bank from 2006-2016, Solomon is credited with bolstering the debt financing business. 
NOT HOPING TO GO BACK A DECADE
Goldman had historically avoided putting its balance sheet to work to support deals because the bank usually represented acquisition targets rather than acquirers. But Solomon, who spent the early part of his career in debt markets, saw big opportunities for Goldman to be a lender at a time when low interest rates were prompting companies to borrow at an unprecedented rate.
His decision helped the broader investment banking unit's revenue soar 70 percent during the time Solomon was one of its leaders. That helped offset a sharp decline in trading revenue that has plagued Goldman since 2009. 
A $5 billion increase would represent growth of around 15 percent over Goldman's 2017 net revenues of more than $32 billion. In 2016 revenues of $30.6 billion were down more than $3 billion from 2015. The firm reported $45.17 billion in revenues in 2009, second only to its record revenues of $45.99 billion in 2007.
""We don't sit around hoping that 2007 or 2009 will happen again and that the world will go back to where we were a decade ago,"" said Stephanie Cohen, chief strategy officer. ""David is a leader who embraces the future without forgetting the past. And he's got a strong heritage within one of our strongest businesses.""
More recently, Solomon has been encouraging investment bankers to go beyond the CEOs they typically pursue for M&A transactions, and also to develop relationships with corporate treasurers and executives who oversee operations like hedging. The idea is to convince those who choose which banks to borrow from and trade with to use Goldman Sachs instead of powerhouses like JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) or  Citigroup  Inc (N:C).
Solomon is not shy about getting personally involved, associates said, leading client meetings and giving feedback. He has also been a big proponent of cross-selling for many years. When he ran investment banking, he made a particular effort to connect people within the investment banking and investment management divisions to share expertise and ensure better client coverage. ¬†
""David has got everyone in a room talking about collaboration a lot more,"" another executive said. 
Solomon clearly has some level of support internally ‚Äì including from his boss, CEO Lloyd Blankfein, who told Goldman's board of directors last month that Solomon was his top pick as a future successor, a person familiar with the matter said. That decision prompted Harvey Schwartz, the other co-chief operating officer, to announce this week that he will leave the bank in April. 
But Solomon still has work to do in winning over Wall Street, where investors and analysts remain skeptical of management's revenue plan.
Instinet analyst Steve Chubak took a close look at assumptions behind Goldman's plan to produce $5 billion more in annual revenue by 2020 in a November report titled ""All That Is Goldman Does Not Glitter."" He concluded that management's view on the profit potential of consumer lending was too rosy and that, overall, the new business will not make up for high-margin trading revenue that has evaporated.
Others expressed similar doubts in interviews this week.

""Lloyd Blankfein is a master of markets...and those are tough shoes to fill,"" said  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo.

986,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 14, 2018 05:47AM ET</span>","Renewed trade war fears pummel world shares, dollar","By Sujata Rao
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares slipped for the second straight day and the dollar held near one-week lows after U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to slap $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports reminded investors of the threat to world economic growth.
Equity markets were attempting to recover after Tuesday's hefty losses, heartened by robust Chinese factory data, but struggled to overcome fears of a global trade war as well as the prospect of political uncertainty in the United States.
""As long as the threat of protectionism and a trade war remains, markets will remain vigilant,"" Rabobank analysts told clients.
The tariffs, reportedly targeting Chinese tech, electronics and telecoms, were revealed by sources hours after Trump abruptly fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Tillerson's exit follows that of economic advisor Gary Cohn, a strong free trade proponent.
Since Trump took office in 2017 as many as 35 senior officials from his administration have walked out, including Tillerson, according to Citi.
""The market probably correctly viewed this move as weakening internal White House opposition to some of Trump‚Äôs less market-friendly policies, in particular the President‚Äôs trade policy,"" Daiwa strategist Mantas Vanagas said.
That news had sent the dollar skidding, pushed world stocks lower and bond prices higher. The moves accelerated after news broke of the planned tariffs, with Wall Street closing some 0.6-1 percent lower and hefty losses across Asia, led by technology shares (N225) (HSI) (KS11).
The negative momentum faded somewhat in Europe, with a pan-European equity index up 0.24 percent after falling one percent on Tuesday (STOXX). That left MSCI's all-country equity index down 0.12 percent (MIWD00000PUS), its second day in the red.
(For a graphic on the MSCI and Nikkei chart click http://reut.rs/2sSBRiD) 
The dollar was flat after three days of losses while U.S. Treasury yields were trading just off one-week lows touched earlier in the session (DXY) (US10YT=RR).
German 10-year government bond yields (DE10YT=RR) approached one-month lows and currently stand 20 basis points below this year's peak at 0.60 percent.
Futures signaled a slightly firmer open for Wall Street, reversing their earlier direction (ESc1).
GROWTH 
The trade war fears eclipsed strong economic data from China which showed industrial output expanding at a surprisingly faster pace at the start of the year. Fixed asset investment also beat forecasts, while retail sales improved.
The data helped Brent oil futures up almost half a percent (LCOc1) after two days of declines while copper futures jumped almost one percent. 
""(China's) economy is well placed to weather any increase in U.S. tariff rates. In fact, the Chinese statistical bureau is tipping 'relatively fast growth' for both exports and consumption in 2018, "" said Craig James, Sydney-based chief economist at CommSec. 
The data highlighted the relatively robust picture of China's and also the global economy - the latter is slated to grow this year by 3.9 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund's forecast in January.
(For a graphic on MSCI global equities index through the year click http://reut.rs/2Dqy4wO)
But with inflation remaining subdued, markets do not see U.S. interest rates rising faster than currently priced in while European and Japanese rate rises remain a distant prospect.
While a rate rise by the U.S. Federal Reserve next week is already priced in, Tuesday's data which showed annual U.S. core inflation steady at 1.8 percent did not persuade markets the Fed could raise rates more than three times this year [nL1N1QU184].
That, along with the trade war fears, is keeping the dollar from strengthening much against a basket of currencies (DXY) and failed to make any headway against the yen to which it had briefly hit three-week highs around 107 yen.  
Central banks in Japan and the euro zone also stuck with their dovish message to markets. 
The former revealed in its previous meeting's minutes that most of its policymakers believed it should ""persistently"" pursue powerful monetary easing. 
The euro slipped 0.2 percent against the dollar, inching off an overnight one-month high (EUR=) after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the ECB needed more evidence that inflation was rising towards its target.
Draghi warned however of risks stemming from ""possible spillovers of the new trade measures announced by the U.S. administration.""

987,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 08:08PM ET</span>",Bank fee potential slashed as Trump ends Broadcom's Qualcomm takeover,"By Lynn Adler and Michelle Sierra
NEW YORK (LPC) - A dozen banks that signed on to provide a record US$100bn bridge loan to back Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) Ltd's planned US$117bn takeover of Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc will earn starkly less than planned for extending credit to the chipmaker after US President Donald Trump on Monday blocked the deal over national security concerns.
Broadcom in February detailed the jumbo loan, the biggest committed credit package since global brewer AB InBev's US$75bn loan in 2015 that backed its purchase of rival SABMiller (LON:SAB), for what would be the technology sector's largest deal ever. The loans represented a huge windfall for bankers eager to put money to work and rake in related fees.
""Broadcom‚Äôs 12 bridge lenders now stand to split a total pool of just US$20m to US$40m in fees,"" said Jeff Nassof, a director at Freeman Consulting Services. ""Had the transaction closed, fees for the proposed long-term debt financing package could have reached 10 times this amount.""
The whittled down fees that will be earned include money paid upfront and ticking fees accrued from the time the loan opened, he said. The lost fees include those that would have been taken in by underwriting roughly US$31bn in permanent bond financing that the company said it would issue to reduce the bridge.
The original 12 banks were in the process of downsizing their risk by expanding the bank group when the White House announced it was blocking the bid.
RECORD LOAN THAT WASN'T
The bank financing package included a US$20bn, one-year cash flow bridge facility; a US$4.477bn, two-year term loan; a US$19.679bn, three-year term loan; a US$19.679bn, five-year term loan; and a US$5bn, five-year revolving credit facility, LPC previously reported.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), JP Morgan, Mizuho, SMBC, MUFG,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Scotiabank, BMO Capital Markets, Royal Bank of Canada and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were lead arrangers and joint bookrunners on the syndicated loan.
The banks were either unavailable to immediately comment, or declined to comment.
Silver Lake, KKR and CVC had also agreed to provide US$6bn of convertible bond financing to Broadcom.
With this milestone loan going away, based on administration worries that the merger would give China an upper hand in mobile communications, bankers will have plenty of lending capacity to apply to other situations. The decision to scuttle the deal was based on concerns that the US advantage would be lost to China if Singapore-based Broadcom took over San Diego-based Qualcomm, according to a White House official.
""There is no issue with capacity in the market, full stop,‚Äù said a banker not involved in the deal. ‚ÄúBanks are looking to do business. People would be disappointed with this going away.""
Initial margins are 100bp over Libor on the cash flow bridge, 112.5bp on the two-year term loan, 125bp on the three-year term loan and revolver, and 137.5bp on the five-year term loan, Thomson Reuters LPC previously reported. The revolver pays an initial commitment fee of 12.5bp.
In syndicated loans for investment grade credits, a portion of the bridge fees is usually paid at the announcement of the deal. The other portion is paid at 90 days.
The first dozen banks only got to cash in on the first part.
‚ÄúIf you get an executive order that the deal is not going to happen the (loan) deal goes away,‚Äù the banker said.
Qualcomm, which has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd in the sector, making it a prized asset, has consistently rebuffed Broadcom's acquisition efforts.
Broadcom said in a statement that it was reviewing the presidential order and ""strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns.""
Potential benefactors of the freed up lending capacity generated by the failed Broadcom takeover include US health insurer  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI), which is supporting its roughly US$52bn acquisition of pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co with a US$26.7bn 364-day senior unsecured bridge loan facility.

The company, in announcing its merger last Thursday, had said it had obtained committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley and MUFG.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors (NYSE:GM) chairman and chief executive Mary Barra met on Tuesday with U.S. regulatory chiefs, weeks before the Trump administration plans to decide whether to revise landmark fuel efficiency standards through 2025.
After Reuters learned of the meetings, GM spokesman Pat Morrissey confirmed Barra had met the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department.
At the meeting, the GM CEO ""reconfirmed our priorities for modernizing fuel economy standards, which is the need for one national set of requirements and the need to comprehend new technology developments like increased shared and autonomous electric vehicles,"" Morrissey said.
Automakers are pressing the administration to reach agreement with California to maintain a nationwide set of fuel efficiency requirements.
California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols said in January the board does not believe the standards should be lowered but is willing to discuss modifications if warranted. ""Absent any such evidence, we will certainly resist any changes,"" Nichols said.
Car companies hope to avoid a potential legal battle between federal regulators, many state attorneys general and environmental groups that could leave them in limbo about future rules.
The manufacturers also want rule changes to address lower gasoline prices and a shift in U.S. consumer preferences to larger, less fuel-efficient vehicles.
Industry executives have not publicly asked for specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the Obama administration in 2011, that aimed to double average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025.
The Obama administration said the rules would save motorists $1.7 trillion in fuel costs over the life of the vehicles but cost the auto industry about $200 billion over 13 years.
Auto officials say the Trump administration is considering proposing a significant reduction in the requirements. Any changed regulation will not be finalized until next year.
California's emissions rules are followed by a dozen states including New York and Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia that account for about 40 percent of U.S. vehicle sales. 
Other automakers also have been holding meetings with regulators in recent weeks as have environmental groups as others. A meeting is planned this week between EPA officials and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co's top environment and safety officer, officials said.
The EPA is expected to announce by April the existing 2022-2025 requirements are ""not appropriate,"" but it is unclear precisely when EPA and the Transportation Department will unveil proposed reductions in the requirements.
Two administration officials and several automakers told Reuters the timing of proposing reductions in the requirements or new flexibilities for automakers remained in flux. EPA officials suggested a proposal could come in late May or June, while the Transportation Department is pushing for a speedier unveiling of a proposal, automakers say.
In June, New York state‚Äôs attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, and 12 other top state law enforcement officials said they would mount a court challenge to any effort to roll back vehicle emission rules.
The Obama administration sought to ""lock in"" the rules by announcing in January 2017 the completion of a ""midterm review"" to determine the feasibility of the 2022-2025 model year rules ahead of an April 1, 2018 deadline.

In March 2017, Trump announced he would reopen that review and suggested he would soften the mandates. ""The assault on the American auto industry is over,"" he told autoworkers in Michigan.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>","Honda, Ford to testify at U.S. Senate Takata hearing: aides","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Executives from Honda Motor Co (T:7267),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and Key Safety Systems will testify at a March 20 hearing on the ongoing massive  Takata Corp  (PK:TKTDQ) air bag inflator recalls of more than 60 million vehicles, committee aides briefed on the matter said Tuesday.
A Senate Commerce subcommittee is holding a hearing on the largest-ever recall in automotive history that some lawmakers say is moving too slow.
The hearing will include National Highway Traffic Safety Deputy Administrator Heidi King; John Buretta, the independent monitor of the Takata recall program,; Honda North America Executive Vice President Rick Schostek and Desi Ujkashevic, global director of Ford's automotive safety office.
Takata said in June that it has recalled, or expected to recall, about 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States in vehicles built by 19 automakers.
At least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries worldwide are linked to the Takata inflators that can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June.
Under the bankruptcy plan, Takata is selling its non-air bag inflator businesses to Key Safety Systems, a unit of China‚Äôs Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (SS:600699). Joe Perkins, chief financial officer of Key Safety Systems, will also testify at the Senate hearing, as will David Kelly, a former NHTSA official who is director of a coalition testing Takata inflators.
Last month, Ford warned 33,000 owners of older pickup trucks to stop driving them until Takata inflators can be replaced after a second death in a 2006 Ford Ranger caused by a defective Takata inflator was reported. The other 20 deaths have occurred in Honda vehicles. Honda issued a similar directive for some vehicles in 2016.
The office of Senator Jerry Moran, the Republican who chairs the subcommittee, said last week the hearing would review recall completion rates, the Takata bankruptcy and other efforts to get unrepaired recalled vehicles fixed.
Takata and Honda did not immediately comment.
Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said the automaker appreciated the opportunity to testify and customer safety was a top priority.
NHTSA says just over half of the 40 million inflators recalled to date have been replaced.

Takata pleaded guilty in 2017 to a single felony count of wire fraud to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation and agreed to a $1 billion settlement.

992,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 05:40PM ET</span>",Activist investor sees Diebold Nixdorf shares doubling with new CEO,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Alexander Roepers recently boosted his firm's stake in Diebold Nixdorf Inc and said the share price could double within 18 months now that there is a new chief executive at the helm of the automatic teller machine maker.
Roepers' $1.2 billion Atlantic Investment Management owns 6.1 million shares, or 8 percent, of the North Canton, Ohio-based company, after buying more stock in February when Diebold traded near $15 a share, a recent regulatory filing shows.
Atlantic first invested in Diebold Nixdorf in late 2016, after the U.S. company acquired Germany's Wincor Nixdorf. It bought a 5.1 percent stake when the stock was trading closer to $23, an earlier filing shows. 
After watching his investment dip last year, Roepers, whose taste runs to old-economy companies and working with management behind the scenes instead of making splashy public demands, now expects to see gains. 
""The newly combined company is now set up for success,"" said the Dutch-born investor, who launched Atlantic in 1988 almost 20 years after the first ATM was installed. He said the share price could increase by 50 percent to 100 percent within 18 months from its current level of around $17. The stock closed at $17.45 on Tuesday.
One reason for optimism may be Gerrard Schmid, who was named chief executive in February. He replaced Andreas Mattes, who exited late last year after running the company since 2013. ""There is a new CEO and we are supportive of him,"" Roepers said. 
Mattes oversaw the $1.8 billion takeover of Wincor Nixdorf in 2016, but Diebold Nixdorf reported a loss in the third quarter last year. Its stock price fell from $34.64 in December 2014 to $16.35 in December 2017.
New U.S. tax cuts turning into windfalls for banks and some of the funds are being earmarked for capital investments, which could help Diebold. JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), for example, said in January that it plans to open 400 new U.S. branches, citing both tax breaks and an improved business climate for the expansion.
""When they open the new branches they won't be putting in old ATMs,"" Roepers said.
Also, older ATMs are being upgraded to appeal to customers, including millennials, who like the new machines' sleeker look and their ability to dispense more cash at one time.
Atlantic's Cambrian Fund Ltd returned 14.12 percent last year and the Cambrian Global Fund gained 17 percent. The funds have returned an average 16 percent and 12 percent a year over their lifetimes and the Cambrian Global Fund is up 5 percent this year.

1. Retail Sales To Rebound, Wholesale Inflation To Cool 
Ahead of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision on interest rates slated for March 21, investors will turn to a duo of reports on the retail sales and wholesale inflation for clues on the underlying the strength of the U.S. economy.
Inflation at the wholesale level as measured by the producer price index is expected to have cooled to 0.2% in February from 0.4% in the prior month. The expected slowdown in wholesale inflation comes despite the latest ISM survey showing manufacturers saw input costs increase at the fastest pace in seven years.
Retail sales growth is forecast to rebound in February after a surprise slump in the previous month.
An above forecast reading could help life sentiment on the U.S. economy, helping the dollar recover some of its losses against a major basket of currencies Tuesday after turmoil in Washington weighed on sentiment.
2. OPEC Monthly Report, U.S. Crude Supply Totals To Confirm Bearish Outlook For Oil Prices?
OPEC is slated to release its monthly report Wednesday at 7.20 a.m. ET, outlining its estimates on global oil demand growth and output. 
Non-OPEC output is expected to garner added investor attention after OPEC in its previous report February, revised upward its estimates for non-OPEC output. The US made up more than half of the non-OPEC upward revision.
A fresh batch of inventory data, meanwhile, from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday at 10.30 a.m. ET is expected to show that U.S. crude stockpiles rose for the third straight week.
Analysts forecast crude inventories rose by about 2.023 million barrels in the week ended March 9.
Crude oil futures settled sharply lower on Tuesday at $60.71 a barrel after the U.S. Energy Information Administration released a monthly report, forecasting shale output in April to rise to an all-time high.
3. All Eyes on Washington Turmoil, U.S. Tariffs 
U.S. President Donald Trump showed no sign of easing his stance on tariffs amid a Reuters report Tuesday that the president is seeking to impose tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese imports, targeting the technology and telecommunications sectors.
This comes as Politico reported earlier that Trump had rejected proposals for tariffs on $30 billion of Chinese imports.
The threat of additional U.S. tariffs could stoke fears of a global trade war and weigh on investor appetite for risker assets at a time when investors are concerned over turmoil in Washington.
President Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday amid differing views over the best course of action on the Iran nuclear deal.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 06:14PM ET</span>","DoubleLine's Gundlach sees U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rising, weighing on stocks","By Trevor Hunnicutt and Jennifer Ablan
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jeffrey Gundlach, the chief executive of DoubleLine Capital and known on Wall Street as the ""Bond King,"" said on Tuesday the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note will likely move higher and pressure riskier assets including equities and junk bonds. 
Gundlach, on an investor webcast, said massive U.S. Treasury supply to fund the ballooning U.S. budget deficit this year along with ""Quantitative Tightening"", or unwinding of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, will lift bond yields. 
""What's unusual is that the deficit is expanding even though we are late cycle,"" in the economic recovery, said Gundlach, who oversaw over $118 billion in assets as of December 31. Gundlach projects the U.S. federal budget deficit to rise to over $1.2 trillion - $1.3 trillion in 2019. 
Gundlach said the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rising above 3.0 percent would almost certainly hurt risk assets, such as equities and high-yield junk bonds. 
More importantly, Gundlach says conviction is high that the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index return will be negative in 2018.
""My conviction on that is actually higher than my conviction right now on whether bond yields are going to break to the upside or downside,"" Gundlach said. 
On Tuesday, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury was trading at 2.84 percent. 
Gundlach said it is ""disconcerting"" that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin does not recognize signs of inflation. Last month, Mnuchin said the economic policies of President Donald Trump and his administration could successfully lift the wages of American workers without triggering overall higher inflation.
""Of course, inflation is inflationary. Of course, rising wage inflation - all things being equal - is inflationary. Yes, it's possible that some other sector of the economy could be incrementally deflationary and offset the rising wage inflation. But I don't see any reason to believe that that's the base case. We don't see any deflationary patterns right now,"" Gundlach said. 
""And if we raise tariffs, if we raise prices on goods, that as well is inflationary,"" he added. 
Overall, he said, Bitcoin is a good precursor for stock market movements. ""Bitcoin is part of the Rosetta Stone to understand what is happening with the social mood,"" he said. 
""We went from an easy investing environment to a tough investing environment,"" Gundlach added. 

Regarding the U.S. dollar, Gundlach said DoubleLine is ""neutral"" on the greenback but ""the next big move on the dollar is lower.""

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 05:49PM ET</span>",Investors challenge Tilton's U.S. bankruptcy plan for her Zohar funds,"By Tom Hals
WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - A lawyer for investors in Lynn Tilton's distressed debt empire told a U.S. judge on Tuesday that his clients plan to challenge her plan to use a bankruptcy filing to end years of legal battles over her private equity portfolio.
The comments kicked off the first hearing after Sunday's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by three Zohar funds, which raised about $2.5 billion from investors to acquire equity and loans to companies that Tilton was trying to turn around.
An attorney for the Zohar funds told Judge Christopher Sontchi that bankruptcy would provide the best forum for resolving years of litigation that has dogged Tilton, the Zohar funds and her Patriarch Partners private equity firm.
The Chapter 11 filing was aimed at halting litigation in eight different venues and bringing more than a dozen parties to one court, according to Zohar attorney Michael Nestor. With the various strands of litigation on hold, Tilton planned to sell or refinance some of her portfolio companies and use that money to pay off in full the investors in the Zohar funds.
An attorney for holders of Zohar notes, however, warned that Tilton and the Zohar funds had to resolve who actually controlled the equity of the portfolio companies, which includes MD Helicopters, Stila Cosmetics and Rand McNally, a map company.
""The truth is the equity ownership does matter and it goes to the heart of what this case will be about, and that goes to control,"" said Brian Lohan, a Sidley Austin attorney who represents holders of Zohar notes. He said the bankruptcy filing was ""very surprising,"" a point echoed by others, who said they had no warning the company was considering Chapter 11.
Nestor told Sontchi the equity ownership did not matter investors would eventually be paid off, resolving their dispute with Tilton.
Management of Tilton's Zohar funds passed to an affiliate of advisory firm Alvarez & Marsal in 2016, as the portfolio companies struggled to pay off their loans. However, Tilton has argued that she retained voting rights for stock owned by Zohar, giving her control over the portfolio companies.

Since then, the investors and MBIA Inc, which insured the notes against default, have been locked in litigation, in part to determine who controlled Tilton's portfolio companies.

1035,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 03:20PM ET</span>","High-end art sales boom in 2017, but it's only a partial market rebound","By Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi
ZURICH (Reuters) - The works of great artists buoyed the art market last year and none did more than Leonardo da Vinci, whose 'Salvator Mundi' sold to great fanfare for $450 million in New York in November.
Global art sales grew 12 percent to an estimated $63.7 billion after two years of falling sales, said a report published by UBS and Art Basel on Tuesday.
That still fell short of the record of over $68 billion set in 2014 and below $66 billion achieved in 2007 before the art market plummeted during the financial crisis. 
""Industry-wide gains were driven by sales at the top end of the market,"" said cultural economist Clare McAndrew, who wrote the report.
Over the past decade, auction sales have fallen for works priced under $1 million, making investment purchases a risky gamble for the lower and middle price segments. 
But purchases of ultra-expensive artworks soared in value, with the study finding a 148 percent increase in total sales value of works sold for over $10 million at auction over the last ten years, and a 125 percent increase over just one year.
Indeed, the study found that just 1 percent of artists whose works were offered at auction accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total auction sales. 
Art experts remain wary of speculative purchases at a time when the world's wealthy, waylaid by political and economic uncertainty, are eager to place cash.
The research indicates that, like wealth -- half of which remained in the hands of the top 1 percent in 2017 -- the art market has become top heavy.
The Salvator Mundi painting was only recently rediscovered after being sold at auction for 45 pounds, attributed to one of Da Vinci's students, in 1958.
Art dealers took a gamble on the damaged and partially covered work, paying $10,000 in 2005 before restoring and verifying it for an $80 million resale in 2013. It was flipped to Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev for $127 million later that same year.
2017 also set a new record for the late American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat whose untitled painting sold to Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa for $110.5 million in May. A work by Roy Liechtenstein fetched $165 million in a private sale. TOP HEAVY ""Away from this premium segment, performance was not all positive, with many businesses coming under pressure,"" McAndrew said.
""This divergence in performance is a continuing concern, particularly as the majority of employment and ancillary spending comes from the very many other businesses in the art trade below the top tier,"" he said.
The largest art markets were also those with the highest numbers of millionaires, with the five largest markets accounting for two-thirds of the world's millionaire population.
Research by UBS, which banks half the world's billionaires, also found a growing engagement amongst the world's very richest with art. 
In a survey conducted with the bank's U.S.-based clients, the world's largest wealth manager found that over a third of the high net worth individuals ‚Äî or those with personal assets over $1 million ‚Äî were active in the art and collectibles market.
While only a third of the collectors placed emphasis on financial return in their collecting, that increased to nearly half for those with wealth over $5 million.
The rapid growth of China's economy and rising wealth over the last two decades helped fuel the art market, the report found, with China overtaking Britain as the second biggest art market following the United States.
Further growth in Asian economies could be expected to fuel more collecting over the next five years, it said.

LONDON/MADRID (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (N:GS) is moving one of its senior London-based dealmakers to Madrid as part of a plan to strengthen its European network ahead of Brexit, sources familiar with the matter said.
Jorge Alcover, a 43-year old managing director from Catalonia, is in the process of relocating to Madrid after serving the Wall Street bank for more than a decade out of its London office in Fleet Street, the sources said.
Alcover heads Goldman's debt capital markets operations for Spain and Portugal and he is also in charge of corporate and public sector derivatives in the region.
He moved up through the ranks by arranging some of Iberia's biggest government and corporate loans while being based in Britain and was named managing director in 2010.
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs confirmed that Alcover will move to Madrid in April but said the decision was not related to Brexit.
""We have a global strategy to grow and expand our footprint by getting closer to our clients,"" the spokesman said. 
""This really has nothing to do with Brexit as you can see with what we're doing in our regional approach in the U.S.,"" he said pointing to cities like Seattle and San Francisco where the bank has moved its client-facing financing teams closer to the companies they advise.
Goldman has about 15 investment bankers in Madrid, the sources said, and may see more Spanish nationals, currently employed in junior roles, shifting to the local office in the coming months.
""Having senior bankers based in Spain or Italy is really important to lure back young talents,"" one of the sources said. ""They would no longer perceived it as a demotion if they see senior staff moving out of London.""
Alcover will work closely with three other managing directors in Spain, namely country head Olaf Diaz-Pintado - who also co-heads the investment banking division in Europe - Juan de Dios G√≥mez-Villalba and Santiago Bau.
Goldman has so far kept most of its European bankers on its British payroll but it is starting to shift some EU nationals to their home countries or to other financial hubs like Frankfurt to better serve its EU clients after Brexit, the sources said.
Such moves mark a shift away from a business model that allowed banks to streamline operations and costs by covering European markets out of Britain.
The sources said Goldman decided to accelerate its plans to decentralize its London-centric operations after British Prime Minister Theresa May ruled out retaining passporting rights for financial services.
The loss of passporting rights - which currently enable finance firms to offer financial, advisory and trading services to corporate clients across all EU states via just one local license - is a key concern for big international banks such as Goldman.
Goldman has recently put more than a dozen UK-based banking, sales and trading staff on notice to move to Frankfurt within weeks. Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) and Britain's  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) have also braced for similar job moves.

Last year, Goldman's co-head of Italy decided to relocate to Milan alongside a handful of Italian bankers. The bank signed a lease for a new office in Milan, near the cathedral, for more than 100 people, increasing its local headcount almost six-fold.

The European Commission charged the company with the pay-for-delay drug deal in July last year, after hitting Denmark's Lundbeck (CO:LUN), U.S. giant Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ) and French drugmaker Servier over similar practices in recent years.
""Teva has responded to the statement of objections robustly, and has attended the oral hearing today,"" the company said in a statement, referring to the EU charge sheet.
""We do not believe that Cephalon and Teva entered into any anti-competitive behavior,"" it said. 
Senior officials from the Commission and national competition agencies as well as rivals and consumer groups typically attend these closed hearings while companies try to reinforce their arguments. 
Teva, the world's biggest generic drugmaker, reached the deal with Cephalon as part of a settlement to end a lawsuit over alleged infringement of the latter's patents on the blockbuster drug. Teva subsequently acquired Cephalon in 2011.

The EU competition watchdog said the deal may have pushed up prices of the drug modafinil. It can penalize companies up to 10 percent of their global turnover for breaching EU rules.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two of Wall Street's largest Washington-based trade groups said on Tuesday that they were merging, as big banks rethink their lobbying strategies under the business-friendly administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.
The Clearing House Association (TCH) and the Financial Services Roundtable (FSR), which both count the likes of  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) among their members, will combine to form a single group to push policy changes in the nation's capital, they said in a joint statement.
Greg Baer, TCH's president, will serve as CEO of the new group, which has yet to be named. FSR announced in February that its chief, former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, would leave the organization this month.
The merger combines TCH's focus on research and regulatory issues with the FSR's experience in lobbying lawmakers, said one person familiar with the deal.
A payments company run by TCH to process transactions across the banking system will remain a separate entity after the merger, which should be completed within 60 days.
Big banks, long-reviled in Washington, have been beefing up and refocusing their external and internal lobbying operations in a bid to capitalize upon Trump's pledge to relax financial rules introduced following the 2007-2009 financial crisis.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) announced several new hires to its government relations team in January, including a new head of public policy, Beth Zorc, who previously had been acting general counsel at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
In July, JP Morgan Chase named Tim Berry as its new head of government relations. Berry had previously worked as chief of staff for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and as an executive at the media outlet Axios.
Commercial banks spent a record $66.6 million on lobbying in 2017, according to the political contributions database OpenSecrets.
""Everyone's really concentrating their power and their turf,"" said Paul Merski, an executive vice president at the Independent Community Bankers of America, which represents small banks. 

While big banks are hoping regulators picked by Trump will eventually ease rules imposed on them, they have yet to score any major victories, despite over a year with Trump in the White House and Republicans running Congress.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cracks have been surfacing in the junk bond market. 
Returns on leading high-yield indexes are down and cash outflows are rising, as are short interest bets against the asset class. In addition, investor protections have shown signs of improvement, suggesting junk bond issuers are being forced to offer better terms to attract interest. 
""Valuations are, in aggregate, stretched,"" Greg Peters, senior portfolio manager at PGIM Fixed Income, which has $709 billion in assets, said on Monday. ""We have definitely taken down our overall risk profile."" 
Bargaining power has long been in the hands of junk-bond issuers, which have been one of the biggest beneficiaries of ultra-low rates set by the Federal Reserve. 
Junk bonds are non-investment grade securities, rated Ba or below by Moody's Investor Service. The lower the rating, the greater the default risk. Some investors like them because in today's market there are not a lot of options for finding yield. 
Since 2011, investor protections, called covenants, have been deteriorating, according to the Moody's Covenant Quality Index (CQI). And yet, investors' insatiable appetite for yield has led them to high-yield bonds, where the average spread of those bonds collapsed to a new low of 331 basis points over U.S. Treasuries in late January, according to ICE Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) data. That collapse was bad for junk bond investors because the yield on bonds is now much lower, but it did provide a short-term benefit for those who were already holding junk because prices rose.
The situation on investor protections has been changing, however. 
With the Fed projected to raise interest rates at least three times this year as inflationary pressures brew, investors are demanding better premiums and covenant protections to hold speculative-rated corporate bonds.
The yield on the ICE BAML index that tracks U.S. junk bonds rose 28 basis points in February to its highest level since December 2016. It now stands at 3.53 percent. 
Research done by Martin Fridson, chief investment officer at Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors, shows a strong correlation between the yield on the ICE BAML index and better covenant scores. ""The index‚Äôs yield rose in February, so that implies some hope for improvement in covenant strength,"" said Fridson.
Covenants on bond issuances typically limit the amount of debt a company can take on, which reduces the risk of default and limits the losses of investors in the event of a default.
But investors were starved for yield in the low-rate environment after the financial crisis of 2008-09, which so increased demand for high-yield products that issuers could afford to offer increasingly worse deals. 
IMPROVING SAFEGUARDS
Though January‚Äôs score was worse than December‚Äôs, and remained in dire territory for the ninth straight month, there are several reasons why covenant quality nevertheless seems to be improving. 
The highest-rated junk bonds - double-B rated - typically have the worst covenant quality as they are less likely to default ‚Äì but the score for those bonds improved in January. Furthermore, those higher-rated bonds made up over half of all junk offerings in January, versus about a quarter in December, lowering the monthly score. 
Finally, the percentage of lowest-rated bonds ‚Äì those ranked from single-B to triple-C rated and which are most likely to default ‚Äì with weak covenants continued to decline in January. 
The spread to Treasuries from bonds rated single-B currently stands at 72 basis points over the benchmark yield. The spread for triple-C rated bonds and below is 495 basis points.
As the Fed has begun to withdraw liquidity, distressed companies become more likely to default. Offering better terms may signal an acknowledgement of that possibility. 
Covenants are not the only indication junk bonds are in for a rocky road. Nervous investors yanked $525 million out of high-yield bond funds the week of Feb. 26, the eighth straight week of withdrawals, according to Lipper. 
In 2018 alone, they have pulled $6.15 billion from the two most popular funds, the iShares iBoxx and SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) U.S. high-yield products. 
Short positions against the three largest junk bond ETFs rose to an all-time high of $7 billion in the last week of February, according to IHS Markit.
Still, the U.S. economy will have to soften before junk bonds deteriorate significantly. ""The junk rally may be over, but it's not clear how quickly spreads (between the yield on junk and on Treasury bonds) will widen,"" said Fridson. 
It may be sooner rather than later, if the rise of covenant-lite bonds, which have no investors protections at all, are an indicator of approaching recession. 
Before the 2008 crisis, covenant-lite issuances peaked. 
They now make up 34 percent of speculative-grade bonds, versus 11 percent in 2011, when Moody's first began recording the data.
If, during the next recession, those over-leveraged junk-rated companies are allowed to fail, investor protections could make a comeback. But if the Fed adopts its 2008 strategy of flooding the market with liquidity, investors will suffer.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AT&T Inc (N:T) can cite a voluntary commitment not to withhold content in licensing talks as a key part of its defense when an antitrust trial begins next week over the fate of the company's planned $85 billion merger with  Time Warner  Inc (N:TWX), U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said on Tuesday.
The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV and other products with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN, among many other channels. A trial is set to start on Monday. 
The government argues the merger would hike pay TV subscribers bills by 45 cents a month, citing an expert analysis.
AT&T contends that analysis is fatally flawed because it does not include its commitment for seven years to agree to binding arbitration over disputes with distributors like  DISH Network  Corp (O:DISH) or Comcast Corp (O:CMCSA) over licensing terms.
The commitment, AT&T and Time Warner said in a legal filing released on Tuesday, ""is a concrete assurance that this merger has never been about raising the price of Turner content.""
Time Warner's Turner owns CNN, TBS, TNT and other networks that air news, sports and other programming. Last year, the government demanded AT&T agree to divest Turner as one offer to approve the merger. 
The Justice Department had urged Leon to exclude the commitment, arguing the AT&T commitment was a ""unilateral promise"" that was not relevant to whether the transaction lessens competition. Leon rejected the Justice Department's argument that the issue would ""waste the court's limited time and confuse the proceedings.""
John Stankey, the head of AT&T's entertainment group who is set to head the combined company's media business, said in a deposition that the company would not withdraw the commitment. 
The government's analysis assumed the combined AT&T Time Warner would have ""bargaining leverage"" that it could use to compel distributors to pay higher prices for Turner networks, citing a model by an economist, AT&T said.
The Justice Department said 20 of 1,000 distributors had agreed to the arbitration offer made in November. AT&T said it modeled the commitment on a provision of the terms of the Comcast acquisition of NBCUniversal.

Leon also denied a request by 11 former Justice Department officials to reconsider his refusal to allow AT&T to demand communications between the White House and Justice Department about the merger probe.

The newspaper, which cited several people familiar with the process, added that one of the sources said a deal could still be a few weeks away.
Commerzbank, which has previously flagged that the unit was up for sale, declined to comment, as did Societe Generale.
The EMC unit includes Commerzbank's exchange traded funds (ETF) portfolio, equity derivatives and other market making businesses.
SocGen's asset manager Lyxor had $172.8 billion in assets under management and advisory as of end-January this year, $84 billion of which was placed in ETFs and indexing.
The unit's head told Reuters in an interview in September that Lyxor Asset Management was prepared to buy a rival provider of index funds to help it maintain its European No.2 market position, but had no plans to join a wave of large-scale deal-making within active fund management.

LONDON (Reuters) - One of soda-maker Dr Pepper Snapple's (N:DPS) largest shareholders has said it may sell its shares in the business ahead of a proposed merger with Keurig Green Mountain, questioning the logic of the deal. 
Keurig agreed on Jan. 29 to offer $18.7 billion in cash a stake in the enlarged company to combine with  Dr Pepper Snapple  and form a North American drinks company, with brands such as Green Mountain Coffee, 7UP, Snapple and Sunkist. 
But some investors have questioned the logic of combining the hot and cold drinks businesses. 
Michael Lindsell, co-founder of London-based Lindsell Train, Dr Pepper Snapple's 9th largest shareholder, said in a letter to investors he was considering selling the firm's stake valued at more than $380 million, according to Reuters calculations. 
""We are yet to be persuaded of the compatibility of the businesses. To us distribution of single serve coffee is very different from canned or bottled beverages,"" he said in his first comments since the deal was announced. 
""No doubt there are some scale benefits and in particular overlapping costs that can be eliminated, but we have yet to be persuaded that we want to be an enthusiastic holder of the combined business which has at least initially a huge overhang of debt."" 

Dr Pepper did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LONDON (LPC) - The European Commission has introduced proposals to bolster cross-border investing in alternative investment funds (AIF) to better improve financing options for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) across the continent.
Investors traditionally look domestically when allocating capital to AIFs, including private debt funds, a situation the Commission wants to change.
The investment fund market across Europe totals ‚Ç¨14.8trn according to the European Fund and Asset Management Association, but 70% of investment funds are registered for sale only in their domestic market.
AIFs, including private debt funds, are able to obtain passport rights under the EU‚Äôs AIFMD, which permits the marketing of investment products throughout the continent. Yet just 3% of AIFs are marketed to more than three member states, the Commission said.
Asset managers have complained that the costs of complying in other member states has prevented them from testing their funds in a new market. While regulators at both the EU and national levels have been concerned at a lack of a level playing field.
The Commission wants to boost competition among funds in Europe as part of its Capital Markets Union (CMU) program.
Among the key proposals is greater transparency for both specific national requirements and how much they charge as well as a European-wide harmonized definition of ‚Äúpre-marketing‚Äù.
Such changes are expected to streamline regulatory issues facing funds operating across Europe and reduce costs related to working within the existing legal framework. The Commission estimates that funds will save between ‚Ç¨306m to ‚Ç¨440m every year under the new proposals.
Further integration of the funds market is seen as a priority by the Commission as the UK leaves the EU. The UK has a huge investor base and the largest private debt fund market, there is a worry that if the market remains fragmented across Europe the overall market may become smaller as a result.
Valdis Dombrovskis, a Commission vice-president, said: ‚ÄúTo have a genuine CMU in Europe by 2019, we need to advance in three directions: European labels and passports for financial products, harmonized and simplified rules to deepen capital markets and more consistent and efficient supervision."" 
Across Europe there is a growing acceptance among authorities of private debt funds providing financing to SMEs.
At the turn of the year, France eased its banking monopoly laws and introduced an legal structure that allows funds to originate laws without the need of a fronting bank. And this month, Ireland's Central Bank permitted funds to expand their credit offerings to borrowers as of this month.
Jyrki Katainen, vice-president responsible for jobs, growth, investment and competitive, said: ‚ÄúWe want to make it easier and cheaper for companies, especially SMEs to get the financing they need.‚Äù

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union banks will have to set aside more capital against new loans that could turn sour as of Wednesday, when the European Commission will publish a proposal on larger backstops for bad debt, a draft document showed.
The European Commission document, seen by Reuters, said the new rules would apply to loans originated from the date of the adoption of the proposal, which is Wednesday, opening them up to potential challenges as banks could face obligations before the new rules take effect.
Banks will have to write down within two years new unsecured loans that turn bad, and secured bad loans within eight, via a gradual but non-linear reduction of their exposure, the document showed.
The revised provisioning requirements will not cover the huge amount of bad debt already on bank's balance sheets.
The commission had considered, but dismissed, the option of postponing the date at which new loans would be covered by the proposed stricter measures to when the proposal was approved by EU states and legislators, a process that could take several months.
Italy, whose banks are among the most affected by bad loan burdens, has long called for a more gradual offloading of soured debt, fearing lenders could face large capital holes if they were forced to write down such loans too fast.
However, the problem concerns mostly old loans. New credit has less of a tendency to turn bad because of better market conditions and banks' more cautious lending practices since the financial crisis.
Italy's outgoing finance minister Pier Carlo Padoan welcomed the commission's proposal on Tuesday, telling a news conference in Brussels that it would make sales of bad debt easier.
Among a package of proposals to be issued on Wednesday, the Commission will also include measures to speed up the sale of bad loans in the secondary market, which should facilitate the sale of existing bad stock at prices that are not very far from banks' valuations. 

EU states and legislators will have to approve the proposals, which will come a day before the European Central Bank releases guidelines on how to speed up the offloading of newly classified bad loans.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) has picked partners to provide battery cells and related technology worth around 20 billion euros ($25 billion) for its growing electric car program, adding further pressure on U.S. pioneer Tesla (O:TSLA).
Until its ""dieselgate"" emissions scandal was revealed two and a half years ago, Europe's largest automaker had been slow to embrace electric cars.
But the fraud prompted a strategic shift, while advances in batteries and a global fight against pollution are raising pressure on carmakers to adopt zero-emission alternatives.
Volkswagen (VW) said on Tuesday it had secured battery technology deliveries for Europe and China, where it sells 80 percent of its vehicles, and will select a supplier for North America soon.
While Tesla's much-anticipated Model 3 sedan has already missed some key production targets, VW plans to expand assembly of zero-emission cars to 16 plants globally through the end of 2022 from three at present.
""We have pulled out all the stops over the past months to implement the Roadmap E swiftly and resolutely,"" Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said at a news conference, referring to the electric vehicle (EV) program.
VW's emissions scandal, new Chinese quotas for electric cars and tightening rules on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Europe are causing automakers to focus on green cars and self-driving technology.
VW has a goal to sell 3 million electric cars per year across the group by 2025 and to offer an electric version of each of the group's 300 models by 2030.
LG Chem (KS:051910), Samsung (KS:005930) and Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) will deliver batteries to VW, which has no plans to start producing powerpacks by itself, Mueller said.
""Building up expertise and mastering the technology does not necessarily imply that we want to start large-scale assembly of batteries ourselves,"" the CEO said. ""Others can do it better than we can.""
Although grappling with billions of euros in costs and fines for dieselgate, VW has pledged to spend 34 billion euros on EVs, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022, one of the most ambitious plans in the industry.
Separately, the German carmaker reiterated guidance for higher vehicle sales and revenue this year and for a group operating margin of 6.5-7.5 percent after 7.4 percent last year.
In an interview with Reuters TV, Mueller denied top management had a pessimistic view on VW's business prospects in 2018, but said potential bottlenecks as carmakers rush to get models through new so-called WLTP lab tests for emissions and fuel consumption were causing uncertainty.
""We have to deal with WLTP this year,"" he said. ""It's simply too early to speculate whether this will be an especially good year or a normal year.""

Shares of the company, which missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates, were down nearly 5 percent at $31.
Dick's Sporting said last month it would not sell guns to people under age 21 and would stop selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines following the massacre at a Florida high school.
The company said it expected 2018 consolidated same-store sales to be flat to decline a low single-digit percentage, including the impact of the recent firearm policy changes.
Analysts were expecting same-store sales to grow 0.15 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""It's only been two weeks, and we've seen a bit of a difference in the hunt business, not an awful lot, but it's too early to tell how this is going to be impacted,"" Chief Executive Officer Edward Stack said on a post-earnings call with analysts.
The company forecast 2018 profit in the range of about $2.80 to $3 per share, while analysts were expecting $2.80.
Telsey analyst Joseph Feldman said he expected sales in other categories such as golf, athletic wear to make up for sales lost in the hunting gear business, pegging the latter's share in total sales at about 10 percent.
The retailer's fourth-quarter net sales rose 7.2 percent to $2.66 billion, but missed estimate of $2.74 billion.

The deal would have created a major competitor for the chipmaker.
Intel, which historically has not been a major player in mobile chips, has been  trying to grow its presence in the segment and even considered entering a competing bid for Qualcomm to stave off the threat of increased competition.
Together, the competing chipmakers had 2016 revenue of $14.77 billion from mobile chips, compared to Intel's $327 million in the same segment.
Intel's total adjusted revenue, most of which is from processing hardware not for mobile, was $62 billion in 2017. A combined Qualcomm-Broadcom company could theoretically create the third-largest chip company by revenue.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has recently entertained the idea of replacing its Qualcomm chips in iPhones for Intel hardware, a KGI Securities analyst  said in February. Qualcomm‚Äôs stock nosedived on the report.
For now, Intel is likely safe from any new international competition, at least until Wall Street fully processes all the ramifications from Trump‚Äôs citing of national security to block the merger.
""This decision hangs a huge ‚Äònot-for-sale‚Äô sign on just about every American semiconductor firm,"" Scott Kennedy, deputy director and chair of China studies at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington,  told Bloomberg News. ""A Chinese entity doesn‚Äôt need to be anywhere near a transaction now in semiconductors for the deal to be nixed.""
Trump has now blocked a total of nine takeover attempts by foreign companies, mostly from China, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

1104,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 11:07AM ET</span>",GOLDMAN SACHS: Stocks are at a key level and we expect 'one more leg to new lows',"The  volatility that rocked the markets earlier this year might have calmed down a bit, but Goldman Sachs warns the selloff may not be over just yet. 
The  S&P 500 tumbled more than 10% over a 10-day period in late January/early February, bottoming out at 2,532. It has since recovered most of its losses, rallying all the way back up to almost 2,800, where it is contending with a key level. 
In a note to clients sent out on Sunday, Goldman Sachs' technical team, led by Sheba Jafari, fingered this area as the level to watch in the S&P 500.
""This 2,789-2,793 area includes the interim high from late- February, a minor equality target from Mar. 2nd as well as 76.4% retrace off the January high,"" Jafari wrote. ""Given just how many pivots are converged there, should be an interesting one to watch for signal. Initial bias is to expect a top/turn.""
Jafari and her colleagues used technical analysis ‚Äî specifically the Elliott wave theory‚Äî to show the more than 10% drop that took place earlier this year likely has further to go. 
The Elliot Wave Principle identifies up-and-down trends in the market on charts. Its basic idea is that human behavior tends to move and then revert in recognizable cycles, especially when traders are acting like a herd; what goes up eventually comes down.
A complete cycle has eight waves ‚Äî the first five are impulsive, while the last three are corrective (A, B, C) ‚Äî and that's where we are now.
""Structurally speaking, the move since February qualifies as the B wave of an incomplete ABC pattern,"" Jafari says. ""There would need to be evidence of impulsive behavior (which hasn‚Äôt been seen yet) to override the expectation of one more leg to new lows (wave C).""
As to how far the S&P 500 can fall, Jafari doesn't give a target, but warns a retest of the recent lows could be in the cards. ""The 200-dma remains critical down at 2,570,"" Jafari wrote."
1105,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 11:02AM ET</span>",South Dakota urges Supreme Court to click 'buy' on internet sales tax,"By Lawrence Hurley
PIERRE, South Dakota (Reuters) - The woman walked into Cash Hogen's hardware store last fall to ask a single question about a KitchenAid mixer on display: What did the manufacturer call that color scheme?
‚ÄúTangerine,‚Äù replied Hogen. And with that, the woman walked out.
It is a kind of customer interaction that happens often these days, said Hogen, who has run his store in Pierre, South Dakota's downtown historic district since 1983.
People come in to look at a product, ask a question or two, then leave, presumably to search for it more cheaply online. Retailers even have a name for the practice: ‚Äúshowrooming.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a gut feeling that she‚Äôs not buying it from me,‚Äù he said.
One reason customers shop elsewhere, Hogen says, is that even when he can compete on price, he has to charge sales tax, which ups the ultimate price of his merchandise. The mixer, for example, normally has a $399.99 price tag in Hogen‚Äôs store, on top of which he has to charge $26 in state and local sales taxes. Some online retailers sell the mixer at the same price or lower, with no sales tax and free shipping.
That sales tax differential is at the core of a case that will come before the U.S. Supreme Court on April 17, and the stakes are high not only for store-keepers like Hogen, but also for online retailers, for state governments and for bargain-hunting consumers.
The case stems from a South Dakota law passed in 2016 by legislators at the state capitol building a few blocks from Hogen's store that requires out-of-state online retailers to collect state sales taxes.
The state enacted the law knowing it would be challenged, due to a 1992 Supreme Court ruling in the case of Quill Corp v. North Dakota, which held that states cannot require retailers to collect sales taxes unless they have a ‚Äúphysical presence‚Äù in the state.
Passing a law certain to draw fire was ""the nuclear option,"" said Republican state Senator Deb Peters, a prominent supporter of the measure, but legislators considered it necessary as internet sales continue to rise.
After the law was enacted, the state preemptively sued four online retailers.  Overstock.com  (NASDAQ:OSTK) Inc, Wayfair Inc and Newegg Inc contested the lawsuits, while the fourth company, Systemax Inc, decided not to. After losing in lower courts, South Dakota appealed to the Supreme Court, which announced in January it would hear the case.
The state will argue that the legal precedent dates back to the days of catalog sales and is no longer relevant in the internet age.
A ruling in favor of South Dakota could funnel up to $13 billion a year of new tax revenues into the coffers of affected U.S. state governments, according to a 2017 federal government report.
It would also make it harder for consumers to find deals online where they can avoid paying sales tax.
Hogen is following the Supreme Court action, but while a favorable ruling for the state might help him, he said, he knows a single court ruling cannot reverse the e-commerce trend.
""If this sales tax thing goes through, it‚Äôs not going to end internet shopping,"" he said. ""That‚Äôs here to stay.""
""PHYSICAL PRESENCE""
The rugged, rural, Republican-led state of South Dakota is notoriously stingy when it comes to spending taxpayer dollars. It has no income tax and relies heavily on sales taxes for revenue.
The state estimates it loses up to $50 million a year in sales tax on internet purchases, which now account for 8.4 percent of sales nationwide, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
The new law requires out-of-state online retailers to collect sales tax if they clear $100,000 in sales to South Dakota residents or have 200 separate transactions with customers in the state.
Wayfair, Overstock and Newegg did not respond to requests seeking comment. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), the dominant internet sales company, has not taken a position in the legal battle and declined to comment for this story.
Amazon has already agreed to collect sales taxes in all 45 states that impose them. The company has not generally collected taxes for items sold on its website by third party vendors, which constitute about half of total sales on the platform, although two states have now enacted laws to require it to do so.
The South Dakota law does not directly affect some other large online retailers, such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and Macy's Inc. (NYSE:M), because they have brick-and-mortar stores in the state and so were already required to collect sales tax.
Other states have also wrestled with how to collect out-of-state taxes from e-tailers, including New York, which passed a law in 2008 that sought to stretch the definition of ‚Äúphysical presence‚Äù without running afoul of the Supreme Court precedent.
The amount of money states stand to gain from taxing online sales is uncertain. A widely-cited 2009 study by the University of Tennessee, updated in 2012, estimated that $23 billion a year in state and local revenue was being lost nationwide to internet commerce in 2009 and would increase every year.
But data from states that have tried to capture online sales tax revenue suggest that number may be high.
In New York, for example, the state has said in court papers that between the 2008 passage of its law and February 2012, e-tailers remitted $360 million in sales tax. The University of Tennessee study had estimated that, by 2012, New York could collect nearly twice that amount in a single year by applying state and local sales taxes to internet purchases.
In fiscal 2017, South Dakota took in just over $1.4 billion in sales taxes, according to the state's Department of Revenue, which accounted for 71.7 percent of the state‚Äôs total revenue.
Only Washington state and Tennessee have a higher proportion of sales tax to total tax revenue, according to the Tax Foundation.
Despite South Dakota's predictions of major gains, Governor Dennis Daugaard acknowledged in an interview that ""it's really quite difficult to know"" exactly how much additional revenue the state will gain if it wins at the Supreme Court.
KENNEDY'S ROLE
The impetus for South Dakota's law came from one of the nine people who now hold its fate in their hands: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy.
In a 2015 opinion on a related issue, Kennedy questioned the continuing relevance in the internet age of the 1992 Quill ruling that only sellers with a physical presence in a state could be required to collect sales taxes. He urged those with a stake in the issue to ‚Äúfind an appropriate case for this Court‚Äù to reconsider the earlier precedent. A ruling in the case is due by the end of June.
Carl Szabo, general counsel of NetChoice, an e-commerce trade association urged the court to defer to Congress on the issue, stressing the complexities of allowing states to collect taxes nationwide.

""One of the fears I have is that there‚Äôs nothing to limit small businesses from being inundated by demand letters from tax collectors around the country,"" he said.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 10:50AM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank to refrain from selling DWS shares for six months after IPO,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has agreed not to sell any additional shares in asset management unit DWS for six months after the planned initial public offering (IPO) on March 23, DWS said in the prospectus for the deal published on Tuesday. 
Deutsche Bank set the price range for the planned IPO of DWS at 30 to 36 euros a share on Sunday, valuing the division at up to 7.2 billion euros ($8.9 billion).
That would raise proceeds of between 1.5 billion and 1.8 billion euros, less than the maximum the bank had initially hoped for as it repairs its balance sheet and restructures the flagship German bank.
Deutsche said in March 2017 it would list a stake in DWS as part of a broader overhaul to help it move on from a string of lawsuits and trading scandals. The IPO has been brought forward as the bank hopes to lock in stock market valuations ahead of any further market correction.
DWS will be overseen by a supervisory board of twelve with Deutsche's Chief Administrative Officer Karl von Rohr as chairman, as well as the lender's Chief Regulatory Officer Sylvie Matherat and Germany retail banking head Asoka Woehrmann.
Separately, DWS has enlisted Evonik (DE:EVKn) finance head Ute Wolf and former BASF (DE:BASFn) manager Margret Suckale to become independent members of the supervisory, alongside Aldo Cardoso, a non-voting member of Axa Investment Managers' board. ‚ÄçNippon Life Insurance Company, which acquired a 5 percent stake in DWS which it has vowed to keep for at least one year, will be represented by Hiroshi Ozeki, DWS said in the prospectus. 
March 23 is expected to be the new stock's first trading day on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

LONDON (Reuters) - The chief executive of U.S. firm Dana Incorporated (N:DAN) is in London meeting top GKN (L:GKN) shareholders in a drive to persuade the British engineer's investors to back a deal with Dana and reject a hostile bid by  Melrose  Industries (L:MRON). 
GKN agreed a $6.1 billion deal to merge its automotive division with Dana, an Ohio-based maker of axles and driveshafts, on Friday in a transaction it hopes will help to fend off an unwanted takeover approach by Melrose, a UK-based industrial turnaround specialist. 
Melrose responded to the Dana deal by raising its cash-and-shares bid for all of GKN on Monday, an offer that at the time valued the FTSE 100 engineer at 8.1 billion pounds ($11.3 billion) and which was declared ""final"", meaning it cannot be increased under Britain's takeover rules.
James Kamsickas, the Dana chief executive, is now in Britain to discuss the merits of the automotive deal with GKN's major shareholders, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Dana CEO is expected to spend most of the week in Britain meeting GKN shareholders, one of the sources added.
The battle for the future of GKN, a mainstay of Britain's engineering sector, is reaching its final stages. 
GKN shareholders have two options. They can choose Melrose's offer of 81 pence in cash for each GKN share plus 1.69 new Melrose shares, a deal that will hand them a 60 percent stake in the London-listed turnaround specialist. 
Or they can back GKN's plan, which would see them take a 47.25 percent stake in New York-listed Dana.

GKN, led by new CEO Anne Stevens, has also pledged to sell off its powder metallurgy business, which along with the Dana deal would leave the engineering group focused on the aerospace sector, supplying parts for aircraft including the Eurofighter Typhoon. ($1 = 0.7181 pounds)

1127,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 09:50AM ET</span>",Maersk's port business woos customers with new transport services,"By Stine Jacobsen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk's (CO:MAERSKb) is betting on winning new customers for its port division by becoming a one-stop shop that can transport goods from factory to retailers' shelves.
The move comes as Maersk, the world's biggest container shipper, is entering uncharted territory following its sale last year of most of its energy businesses. This marked a major shift of focus for the group towards transport and logistics.
Last month, Maersk said it aimed to expand its port and transport services, giving customers the chance to deal with one company when shipping goods from factory to shop shelf.
Maersk has said it aims to become a global integrator of container logistics and is looking to models similar to the courier express and package industry, where customers deal with just one company such as UPS (N:UPS) or FedEx (N:FDX). But Maersk has no plans to enter the courier and package business.
As part of the expansion, APM Terminals, the group's port division, which operates 74 port facilities and handled nearly 40 million containers last year, will expand onshore services to cater to companies like railway operators and freight haulers. 
""If we're going to optimise Maersk's entire end-to-end supply chain then of course we need to optimise one of the points that could otherwise be a bottleneck and that's the port,"" APM Terminal's chief commercial officer Henrik Lundgaard Pedersen said in an interview.
Pedersen said customers were increasingly asking for add-on services at the port terminals, which are the effective ""nerve centre"" for transporting cargo around the world.
He said customers' were looking to deal with ""fewer business partners to do the same or more types of services.""
The new services include streamlining the process of weighing, stripping and filling the shipping containers and improving trucker appointment systems for delivery and pick-up.
""In some parts of the world, truckers can wait hours outside our terminals,"" Pedersen said. The planning to reduce waiting time is becoming ""very, very critical,"" he said. 
As part of the plans, APM Terminals has set up landside facilities within customers' premises in Peru and Chile so it can take charge of a cargo before it even leaves the mine or plantation.
""We go all the way into where they grow the grapes, then we help them get them into the right container and all the way through the port to your dining table,"" Pedersen said.
In Mexico, for example, APM Terminals organizes train transport from the Pacific Coast to premises close to Mexico City.
Maersk captured synergies worth $100 million last year from integrating its transport and logistics business and targets total synergies of $600 million by 2019.
Pedersen declined to give details on what investments were expected, but said capital expenditure for handling equipment was ""much less"" than when taking cargo from ship to shore.
APM Terminals is the second-biggest division after Maersk Line, the world's largest container shipper, and it accounted for around 13 percent of revenue last year.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) has told police it has uncovered additional exposure of about 9.42 billion rupees ($145.2 million) in connection with a huge alleged fraud, according to a court filing seen by Reuters.
In what has been dubbed the biggest fraud in India's banking history, PNB, the country's second-biggest state-run lender, said last month it had been defrauded of about $2 billion.
The bank accused two jewelry groups - one controlled by diamond tycoon Nirav Modi and the other by his uncle, Mehul Choksi - of colluding with rogue bank employees to secure credit from overseas lenders using fraudulent guarantees.
Both men deny any wrongdoing. Police say they left India in January, before the initial complaint was filed, and their whereabouts are unknown.
In a court filing on Tuesday police said that, including a new complaint filed by the bank, the total amount Choksi's Gitanjali group of companies allegedly defrauded PNB of has reached 70.8 billion rupees ($1.09 billion).
A lawyer for Gitanjali group's head, Mehul Choksi, said he was unaware of the new allegations and declined to comment. 
Law enforcement agencies had previously attributed 61.38 billion rupees of the alleged fraud amount to Gitanjali, and nearly 65 billion rupees to companies controlled by Modi.
PNB has also alleged Modi's companies cheated it by a further 3.22 billion rupees, which it said was not used for the purposes for which the loans were given.
Tuesday's disclosure takes PNB's overall exposure in the still unraveling fraud case to well over the $2 billion mark.
PNB did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
WHO FOOTS THE BILL? 
The alleged fraud has shaken India's financial sector, leading to a government and central bank crackdown on lenders' systems and practices.
Banks also continue to debate who should assume liabilities from the fraud, with several lenders that have either lent to the jeweler groups based on the fraudulent PNB guarantees, or bought the so-called letters of undertaking from the secondary market, wanting PNB to compensate them.
PNB has said it will honor only ""bona fide"" commitments, arguing other banks that lent to the jeweler groups shared in the blame by not carrying out adequate checks.
The Economic Times daily, citing unnamed sources, reported earlier on Tuesday that PNB would honor claims by peer banks that issued credit to the jewelers, but with a few caveats.
Banking sources, however, said such an agreement was not yet a done deal.
""We are talking. But then we have not come to a conclusion,"" said a senior banker, who did not want to be named, adding that PNB had not yet provided concrete assurances of repayment.
Another said that, although they were hopeful of arriving at an ""amicable solution"" on who takes the liability, it would likely need intervention by India's central bank and the government.
Banks would need to make provisions for any potential losses from fraud when they report results for the March quarter, said the banker.

State bank shares rose on Tuesday after an easing in retail inflation allayed fears of a central bank interest rate increase in the near term, with the sector index (NIFTYPSU) gaining 2.3 percent.

1144,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 08:34AM ET</span>",What Solomon's Ascent at Goldman Signals About Its Future,"(Bloomberg) -- When  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).‚Äôs leaders unveiled their strategy six months ago to reshape the Wall Street powerhouse into a more traditional bank, it was trading veteran Harvey Schwartz who led the presentation.
Now, it‚Äôs his top rival in the race to become the next chief executive officer, David Solomon, who appears poised to carry out the plan.
The abrupt emergence this week of Solomon, 56, as heir apparent to CEO Lloyd Blankfein marked a dramatic turn in fates for the men who spent 15 months vying as co-presidents for the top job -- an outcome that will further a significant shift within the firm. Businesses such as investment banking and financing, which Solomon knows better, keep gaining ground on sales and trading, which long propelled Goldman earnings -- as well as Blankfein‚Äôs and Schwartz‚Äôs own careers.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs going to be a power shift, there‚Äôs no question about it,‚Äù said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, predicting it may affect the makeup of the powerful management committee. ‚ÄúSometime in 2020 is when you‚Äôre going to see the real struggle for resources develop‚Äù between those two sides, he said.
‚ÄòFresh Perspective‚Äô
Blankfein and the board were impressed, insiders say, by Solomon‚Äôs proven ability to build businesses, the strength of the dealmaking team he assembled and his efforts to recruit and retain talent. Those qualities became even more valuable as the bank decided it had focused too much on hedge funds as trading customers, at the expense of corporations.
In recent years, the firm has leaned more on investment banking and asset management amid an industrywide slowdown in the markets businesses that in 2017 contributed to the worst year for trading under Blankfein‚Äôs watch. The CEO had long sought to preserve the firm‚Äôs franchise, predicting activity would pick up.
‚ÄúPerformance within the trading division has faced clear headwinds over the past couple of years and we believe a change in leadership may provide fresh perspective,‚Äù UBS Group AG analyst Brennan Hawken wrote in a report Monday. He said the shift away from trading ‚Äúcould get a subtle boost under Mr. Solomon given his diverse background (i.e. not another trader).‚Äù
Goldman didn‚Äôt specify a timeline for Blankfein‚Äôs eventual retirement when it announced the shakeup of his lieutenants. Schwartz, 54, will leave the firm April 20, making Solomon the sole president and chief operating officer, the New York-based company said.
So for now, Solomon and Blankfein will jointly execute the strategy presented in September. The plan calls for boosting revenue by $5 billion in three years, in part by expanding operations previously seen as a sideline, such as lending to consumers through an online bank.
Big Clients
Solomon didn‚Äôt get an interview with Goldman Sachs after he graduated from Hamilton College in 1984. Instead, he joined more than a decade later, after earning respect as a competitor.
The offer came in 1999 while he was at Bear Stearns Cos. There, he jockeyed with Goldman‚Äôs team before the firms ended up collaborating to raise almost $1 billion of high-yield debt to help casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson build the Venetian resort in Las Vegas. Even back then, Blankfein advocated hiring Solomon, who arrived with the rank of partner -- a relatively rare feat. Over the years, he‚Äôs maintained client relationships with U.S. corporate leaders including Walt Disney Co.‚Äôs Bob Iger and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.‚Äôs Jeff Immelt and John Flannery, according to a person with knowledge of the business.
‚ÄúDavid was a very young guy at Bear Stearns, but it was very apparent he was a gifted manager even back then,‚Äù Alan Schwartz, chairman of Guggenheim Partners who worked with Solomon at Bear Stearns, said in an interview. ‚ÄúWhen he went to Goldman we were disappointed, but not at all surprised of the number of jobs and promotions he picked up over time.‚Äù
Solomon rose through Goldman‚Äôs financing operation and eventually ran the firm‚Äôs top-ranked investment-banking arm for a decade. During that time, Goldman Sachs decided to build out the debt capital markets business, largely territory dominated by the commercial banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). The unit now ranks among the largest lenders to M&A buyers.
Even as the bank‚Äôs bond trading results faltered, it kept growing in debt underwriting. Goldman earned a record $2.94 billion of revenue from that business last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That‚Äôs been helped by deals such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).‚Äôs purchase of Whole Foods Market Inc (NASDAQ:WFM)., where the bank provided short-term bridge loans.
Yet, it‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt know trading. His initial years at Goldman included stints running leveraged finance and a larger credit business. By 2002, he was a member of the fixed-income business‚Äôs operating committee, overseeing the Asian special-situations group, corporates, credit derivatives, credit research and leveraged finance.
Solomon is known for his adaptability, honing a wide range of skills professionally and in his personal life. He moonlights as an electronic music disc jockey, skis avidly, collects wine and eats out frequently, picking restaurants with the purposeful zeal of a food critic. The Society of Bacchus America once awarded him the title Mr. Gourmet 2010.
But his absence during last September‚Äôs presentation also underscored one of the banker‚Äôs weaknesses as a CEO candidate that matters for any company: Big shareholders didn‚Äôt know him. He set out to fix that in the months that followed, traveling the globe for more than two dozen one-on-one meetings with large investors. Just last week, he visited Boston to sit with Fidelity Investments and MFS Investment Management Co.
In notes on Monday, some analysts mentioned that they too had met with Solomon. Several welcomed his ascent because, strategy aside, it resolves uncertainty.
‚ÄúIt removes the risk that there could have been co-CEOs upon Blankfein‚Äôs retirement,‚Äù Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote in a note to clients. ‚ÄúThat structure can be unwieldy.‚Äù

""Almost half of outstanding mortgages will have an interest rate reset within the year, which will increase the strain on households' debt-servicing capacity,"" analyst Jason Mercer wrote in a report.
The Canadian economy added 15,400 jobs in February. On a year-over-year basis, employment rose by 282,500, or 1.5 percent, according to data from Statistics Canada.
The Bank of Canada has hiked rates three times http://reut.rs/2IjMYc2 since last July. The next rate hike is expected to come after July.
The proportion of uninsured mortgages, including lines of credit for home equity, has risen to 60 percent this year from 50 percent five years ago, the credit ratings agency said.
An average Canadian household owed a near-record C$1.67 ($1.35) for every dollar of disposable income in the first quarter last year, mainly because of mortgage debt. (http://reut.rs/2DlhUVv)
Insured mortgages in Canada have been on the decline due to the country's decision to restrict supply and increase premiums.
Moody's added that as debt-to-income levels rise, the banks will feel the impact on its unsecured credit card portfolios first and hurt the asset quality.
Credit card loans require no supporting collateral and have a lower repayment priority for financially strapped borrowers, making the losses on such loans more severe compared to losses on consumer lending, Moody's said.
Moody's said longer auto loans flag a growing risk as vehicle values fall faster than the loan is repaid.
""This shortfall is often rolled into the initial balance of a new car loan, compounding the negative equity and credit risk,"" Moody's said.

More than 2 million vehicles http://reut.rs/2Fy9D6y were sold last year in Canada, the highest ever in a year, and vehicles sales continue to be on the rise so far this year compared with a year earlier.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's collapsed Saad Group, led by businessman Maan al-Sanea, has called a meeting with creditors in a last-ditch attempt to end a dispute over 16 billion riyals ($4.3 billion) of claims, sources close to the matter said.
Advisers to the group have asked creditors to meet in Dubai over the next few days, seeking a deal before Saudi authorities start auctioning, from March 18, billions of dollars of assets, including machinery, real estate, vehicles, belonging to Maan al-Sanea and his company, the sources added. 
Maan al-Sanea, ranked in 2007 by Forbes as one of the world's 100 richest people, was detained in Saudi Arabia's Eastern province last October for unpaid debt. His case is separate from the dozens of Saudi businessmen and prominent figures who have been held in a corruption crackdown.
Saad Group defaulted together with Ahmad Hamad al-Gosaibi and Brothers (AHAB) in 2009, in what was Saudi Arabia‚Äôs biggest financial meltdown, leaving local and international banks with unpaid debt of about $22 billion.
Advised by Reemas, a financial consultancy, Maan al-Sanea has asked some of Saad's creditors to meet in order to appoint a steering committee to coordinate negotiations between lenders and debtors ‚Äì Saad Group and Maan al-Sanea himself ‚Äì ahead of a potential debt settlement, sources who have seen the term sheet that sets the framework for a deal told Reuters.
The proposal, sent to creditors on March 7, concerns 42 eligible banks that have obtained final non-appealable judgments against Maan al-Sanea, Saad Group, or both, from a court in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, the sources said, speaking anonymously due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Local, regional and international banks eligible for a settlement have claims totaling 16 billion riyals, with international banks such as  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) and Citi (N:C), and regional lenders such as Mashreq, having claims of over 1 billion riyals each, the sources said.
Some observers estimate Saad's total debt to be between 40 billion and 60 billion riyals.
The information sent to creditors does not include a settlement offer, but lists assets that could be discussed as part of a potential deal. 
These include 12.3 million riyals in credit balances with Saudi banks and an additional 22.2 million riyals with other financial companies, the sources said.
They also include a total of 1.57 billion riyals of shares in companies including National Commercial Bank, Kingdom Holding, Samba Financial Group and Riyad Bank; 3.21 billion riyals of real estate assets; stakes in four companies; and so-called ‚Äútop-up assets‚Äù to be contributed by relatives of Maan al-Sanea, the sources said. 
They said Saad Group and Maan al-Sanea would provide a list of such ""top up-assets"" to the creditors shortly and that there was no indication in the term sheet of their value.
A meeting between Saad Group representatives and creditors was scheduled for March 14, but to ensure full attendance it has been rescheduled for next week, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Some creditors said the urgency to hold the meeting was to ensure the value of the assets at stake could be preserved better than under a liquidation process.
But one source familiar with the matter said the Saad assets to be sold on March 18 as part of the liquidation process included items such as machinery and were not the principal assets used in Reemas' proposal, which are real estate and equities, and that the outcome of the sale would not have any significant impact on the proposed settlement talks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes fell on Tuesday as uncertainty in Washington stemming from the dismissal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson dragged down stocks across sectors.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired Tillerson after a series of public rifts over issues including North Korea and Russia. Steve Goldstein, a State Department undersecretary of state for public affairs, was also fired, soon after releasing a statement that Tillerson did not know why he was being pushed out.
Trump has tapped CIA Director Mike Pompeo, seen as loyal to the president, to replace Tillerson.
The influx of political news overshadowed earlier positive economic news earlier. The markets had opened higher after data showed U.S. consumer price growth slowed in February, an indication that an anticipated pickup in inflation probably will be only gradual.
""Pompeo is known to be a real hawk on trade and foreign policy,"" said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Hartland & Co in New York. ""There's nobody to be a check and balance on Trump. It's been unsettling to the market within the context of what we see now in the economy, which is a favorable backdrop.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 104.61 points, or 0.42 percent, to 25,074, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 13.7 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,769.32 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 62.19 points, or 0.82 percent, to 7,526.13.
Tech (SPLRCT) and financial (SPSY) stocks were the biggest laggards among the S&P 500's 11 major sectors. 
Shares of  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) and Alphabet Inc (O:GOOGL) fell between 1.3 percent and 2.3 percent.
""Technology rallied hard yesterday and last week, and there is profit-taking, but it's just a short-term pressure,"" said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.
Financial stocks were weighed as U.S. Treasury yields fell in response to the CPI data and Tillerson's exit.
Among individual stocks,  General Electric  Co (N:GE) fell 4.3 percent after J.P. Morgan cut its price target on the stock to $11 from $14, saying the industrial conglomerate was not a ""safety stock"" in a volatile market.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.55-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 43 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 173 new highs and 22 new lows.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 07:40AM ET</span>",India's solar financing may have peaked for now at $10 billion in 2017: consultancy,"By Krishna N. Das
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's solar industry more than doubled its fund raising to $10 billion in 2017, clean energy consultancy Mercom said, but activity is likely to slow this year as New Delhi plans to slap high tariffs on imports.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of raising India's solar power generation to 100 gigawatt (GW) by 2022, five times current levels. The government says India will need to raise at least $125 billion to reach its goal of generating 175 GW of energy from all renewable sources in five years.
New large-scale and rooftop solar installations in India jumped to 9.63 GW last year, compared with the addition of 4.31 GW in 2016, Mercom said, but predicted additional installations will fall by 22 percent to 7.5 GW this year.
""The lower forecast reflects a smaller pipeline of projects scheduled for commissioning in 2018,"" Mercom said. ""Auction activity was not very robust in 2017 and though there was a surge in activity at the end of the year, most of the projects that were tendered are not likely to be commissioned until 2019.""
Mercom called a proposal by India's safety watchdog to impose a 70 percent duty on imports of solar equipment from China and some other countries, to protect domestic manufacturers, as an ""unexpected and aggressive recommendation that has brought the industry to a standstill"".
Any duty would hurt big project developers in India such as SoftBank (T:9984)-backed SB Energy but would be good for local solar component makers such as Indosolar (NS:INDL) and Moser Baer (NS:MOSR), which have struggled to compete with Chinese companies such as Trina Solar and Yingli (N:YGE).
Reuters also reported in January that solar modules worth more than $150 million were stuck at various Indian ports due to a dispute over their classification and the import tax applicable to them.
Most of the modules come from China, but several consignments were held up because customs officials demanded that some of them be classified as electric motors and generators, attracting a 7.5 percent duty, not as diodes, transistors and similar semi-conductor devices with no duty.
India aims for renewable energy to make up 40 percent of installed power capacity by 2030, compared with 18.2 percent at the end of 2017, and the ministry of new and renewable energy said in January it was looking to address issues facing solar companies.

""The imposition of any additional duties would make solar more expensive and potentially scare away financially strapped distribution companies who are looking to procure the cheapest power generation source available,"" Mercom said.

LONDON (Reuters) - A former  Barclays  (L:BARC) trader lost an appeal against his conviction over Libor benchmark interest rate rigging at London's Court of Appeal on Tuesday.
Alex Pabon, a 39-year-old American former derivatives trader, was jailed in 2016 alongside three other former Barclays traders for conspiracy to defraud in relation to the manipulation of Libor (London interbank offered rate).
But Pabon, who was released last March after serving just under a year in prison, brought an appeal after new evidence came to light about the expertise of one the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) prosecutor's key banking witnesses in the case. 
Judges at London's Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. But in a strongly-worded judgment, they also criticized SFO's decision to instruct Saul Haydon Rowe as a court witness. 
""The instruction of Rowe turned into an embarrassing debacle for the SFO ... (although) it has had no impact on the outcome of this case,"" the judgment said. It added that the case was a ""stark reminder"" that those needing expert witnesses should ensure they were instructing people of ""suitable calibre"".
Rowe came in for the harshest criticism. The judges said he had ""signally failed to comply with his basic duties as an expert"". But they ruled that his evidence had not impacted sufficiently on Pabon's trial to affect the safety of his conviction.
Pabon's lawyers had argued that the evidence Rowe gave during Pabon's trial was incomplete or inaccurate and could have damaged the trader's credibility.
Rowe has previously told Reuters he had always acted in good faith. He did not respond to telephone calls requesting a comment on Tuesday.
Pabon's lawyer was not immediately available for comment. But Pabon said on social media site Twitter: ""There is no such thing as an expert witness in the UK anymore.""
The SFO said it was ""studying the judgment carefully"". Barclays declined to comment.
""GRAVE VIEW""
Rowe, a former trader who ran a company providing expert consulting and testimony in banking cases, was paid more than 400,000 pounds ($557,000) between 2014 and 2017 by the SFO to be a court expert on banking in its Libor prosecutions.
He testified in four Libor trials by providing expert evidence on banking and trading and interpreted communications with or between rate derivatives traders presented in court.
Judges said his failings included obscuring the role others had played in a key report for the prosecution, failing to inform the SFO about the limits of his expertise and flouting court rules about not discussing evidence during testimony breaks.
""We take a grave view of Rowe's conduct; questions of sanction are not for us, so we say no more of sanction but highlight his failings here for the consideration of others,"" the judgment said.
At least three former Libor traders have complained about Rowe to the London police. The Metropolitan police says it continues to assess complaints about witness testimony.
Pabon's conviction is part of a global investigation into allegations that banks colluded in setting benchmark rates such as Libor, against which rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of contracts and loans are set across the world.
Around a dozen of the world's largest banks have been fined about $9 billion pounds as part of the investigation and about 30 traders have been charged in Britain and United States.

His brand, Kurgo, occupies the sort of niche coveted by investors looking to profit from the U.S. pet economy, a range of outdoor gear and accessories for the traveling mutt.
Consumers‚Äô increasing tendency to treat their pooches like family, along with the retail industry‚Äôs need for new products to lure people online and in store, have created a boom in deals for companies catering to pets.
Food brands, particularly those offering premium, natural ingredients, have been among the most popular acquisition targets in the pets space. But as the number of major, independent players shrinks and valuations get steeper, buyers are setting their sights further afield ‚Äì at niche products such as snacks and accessories and services including grooming and doggie daycare.
""We‚Äôve been looking in detail at opportunities in many of the categories over the past 24 months,"" says David Fiorentino of private equity firm J.W. Childs Associates. There has been a lot of competition among investors for buyouts, he said. ""Especially companies with more than $30 million to $40 million in revenue.""
So far this year, there has been at least $8.3 billion worth of transactions, involving veterinary clinics in Australia and cat snacks in the Netherlands as well as pet insurance in the United States and canine raincoats in Italy. 
(For a graphic on pet industry M&A, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2HtkjQB)
Buyers range from private equity firms such as KKR, as well as  General Mills  Inc (N:GIS) and other consumer giants looking to expand beyond cereals and yoghurts for humans to high-protein meals for dogs and cats with sensitive stomachs.
That start to 2018 is close to the same period last year when there was the highest total value of pet-related deals in 16 years. Pet dealmaking has dipped 6 percent on last year's total value of deals while dealmaking in the wider consumer industry has slipped more than 22 percent so far this year compared to 2017, Thomson Reuters data shows.
Spater has been fielding inquiries almost every week from private equity funds and companies looking to buy Kurgo, which he founded with his brother Kitter after the latter rigged up a ‚Äúbackseat barrier‚Äù with some mesh and bungee cords to stop his Plott Hound Zelda from jumping out of the trunk of his car.
‚ÄúObviously, retail is a challenging space, but there‚Äôs a lot of activity in the pet specialty space,‚Äù said Spater. ‚ÄúI think the consolidation is definitely here.‚Äù
David Blatte, a board member of rival cat and dog accessories brand Worldwise, sees the emergence of so-called ‚Äúpet parents‚Äù among Millennials and Baby Boomers creating a large, lucrative gap for health-conscious, high-end products and services.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbelievable. This is the most white space of any consumer sector,‚Äù said Blatte, a former consumer products investment banker, who is currently looking to buy companies selling luxury pet totes and doggie-dental-enhancing chew toys.
Adding to the pressure to consolidate are the distributors, who want suppliers with scale and a wide variety of products.
‚ÄúA lot of these retailers want to deal with less vendors,‚Äù said Blatte. ‚ÄúWe do somewhere like three to four acquisitions a year, smaller pet companies and we bring them into the Worldwise umbrella.‚Äù
Among the more significant deals in the space this year was General Mills acquisition of pet food maker  Blue Buffalo Pet Products Inc  (O:BUFF) for about $8 billion in cash. 
That price equated to around 6 times annual sales according to investment manager Susquehanna International Group, a valuation similar to the sort of multiples seen for health-oriented human foods including Kellogg Co's (N:K) $600 million deal for upstart healthy snack maker RXBar and  Dr Pepper Snapple  Group Inc's (N:DPS) $1.7 billion deal for drinks brand Bai.
‚ÄúValuations are steep,‚Äù said Tim Larsen, a managing director at investment bank Houlihan Lokey, which has negotiated a number of pet deals. 
According to Larsen, even in the universe of private companies, many pet company acquisitions this year and last have been struck at low-to-mid-teens profit multiples. This compares to a multiple of about 10 times across the consumer industry more broadly last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.
For many acquirers, there is competitive pressure to get involved. To match consumer conglomerates Nestle, Colgate-Palmolive Co (N:CL) and J.M. Smucker Co (N:SJM), who all have pet care divisions outpacing core company sales, agricultural giant Cargill ramped up its pet food manufacturing facilities in January through the acquisition of Ohio-based Pro-Pet. The price was not disclosed.
‚ÄúWhen you sit down with your strategic customers and you have every one of them say to you that premium pet is where they need to invest and they need you to be there with them, that‚Äôs a glaring reason to invest,‚Äù said Cargill‚Äôs Feed and Nutrition Retail Director Christi Brown.
DOG SALONS
U.S. consumer spending on premium dog and cat food ‚Äì the sort of meals that combine deboned meat with garden veggies ‚Äì is expected to accelerate by 16 percent in total over the next five years compared to 12.2 percent for pet food more generally, according to market research firm Euromonitor.
Spending on toys, carriers and bedding, as well as food brands for therapeutic or 'prescription' diets are also set to grow at a breezy clip of between 12.1 percent and 12.6 percent even as the total population of pets stays the same, according to Euromonitor.
With a scarcity of targets with scale, Larsen and other M&A advisors are looking at smaller deals focused on healthy foods and snacks.
‚ÄúI think that there should be a wave of deals over the next one, two, three years,‚Äù he said.
Cat catering is also expected to be a growth area, along with premium services aimed at dogs, such as grooming and doggie hotels.
Dan Barton‚Äôs no-expense-spared dog salon chain Splash and Dash Groomerie, headquartered in Florida, still has only 18 franchises generating $14 million in annual revenues across the network, but receives approaches on average every few months from prospective acquirers.
‚ÄúThe big players have been all focused on the food industry and that‚Äôs where there have been a lot of mergers and acquisitions. Players in the service industry, there‚Äôs not many at all,‚Äù said Barton.
‚ÄúMy dog Mercedes is like a family member to me. Like my child,‚Äù said Barton, who sees his own preferences mirrored in younger consumers. ‚ÄúThat is a huge market now that is just starting to become a huge industry.‚Äù
Gordie Spater agrees, and that is what is different from older generations of pet owners. His business was established trying to keep dogs stowed in the trunk of a car but in the future, people might prefer to have them travel upfront. That evolving relationship will require different types of products.
‚ÄúI go into my daughter‚Äôs room this morning and even though my dog is 80 pounds he slept on the twin bed with her all night, and does most nights,"" said Spater.

1159,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 06:10AM ET</span>","Personal trainer, charity caught up in HSBC account freeze","By Lawrence White
TUNBRIDGE WELLS, England (Reuters) - Fitness instructor Ed Lumsden was trying to log in to his online bank account last week when he discovered HSBC had closed it without warning. 
Lumsden, who counts British television presenter Davina McCall among the clients of his gym, TWPT, in the affluent spa town of Tunbridge Wells in Southern England, was unable to receive payments or pay his bills. 
""I couldn't take payments, I couldn't pay my suppliers, all my direct debits would be rejected which could affect my credit rating and I had 16,000 pounds ($22,209.60)locked in the account that I couldn't access,"" he told Reuters at his gym.
He is one of hundreds of HSBC clients whose accounts have been frozen as part of a compliance crackdown called Safeguard aimed at fighting financial crime, even after the bank said in September it had addressed flaws in the program.
Many of those affected run small businesses like Lumsden, who has 6 members of staff. The closure of the main business account can be critical for such companies.
HSBC reinstated Lumsden's bank account within hours of being contacted by Reuters to ask about the reasons for the closure.
Others have not been so lucky. Interviews with HSBC customers, letters and emails from the bank seen by Reuters, and a review of the lender's social media complaints channels show some problems continue, and in some cases are worse.
A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment on the Lumsden case but said there had been some mistakes in the Safeguard program. He said the number of firms affected is a small percentage of the bank's overall customer base.
""Whilst the vast majority of the thousands of customer reviews we undertake proceed without incident, some mistakes are made and we apologize to those customers affected,"" he said. 
The account freezes come at a particularly sensitive time for small businesses waiting to see what Britain's exit from the European Union will bring. 
""As they look to increase day to day scrutiny, it's vital that lenders don't accidentally clamp down on innocent small business owners,‚Äù said Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses.
'MISTAKES ARE MADE' 
The Safeguard program was launched in 2012 to gather more information about customers, such as who their own customers are and why they made or received certain payments. Complaints started to build up after they received a questionnaire in September 2015 presented by the bank as a routine check.
HSBC introduced the program partly in response to scrutiny from the U.S. authorities who said that weak anti-money laundering controls had allowed Mexican drug cartels to launder hundreds of millions of dollars through the bank. 
HSBC was under threat of prosecution for five years unless it tightened controls. That period ended in December without prosecution.
After Reuters and other media reported on problems with Safeguard's administration last year, HSBC said it had made a number of improvements.
But Lumsden, and other new examples uncovered by Reuters, show that the process still is not working for everyone.
British lawmakers said the bank still needed to take steps to improve. 
""To see that this has failed on a number of occasions at a very basic level raises clear concerns, and we expect that these are being proactively addressed by the bank,"" said Kevin Hollinrake, British lawmaker and co-chair of the cross-party group on fair business banking. 
MORTIFIED
World Merit Limited, a charity that works with the United Nations and helps young people to volunteer, said last month HSBC froze its bank accounts for three weeks.
It was impossible to pay staff and the freeze threatened the charity's reputation, Chief Executive Chris Arnold said.
""I'm shocked and mortified that we could be put through the wringer like this,"" Arnold said.
HSBC said it had sent letters as far back as a year ago warning World Merit that it would have to close the account if it did not provide the necessary information.
Arnold said the bank had been using out-of-date contact details, and had failed to follow up its misdirected letters with other forms of communication until this year.
Another customer, who runs a small furniture business in South London but did not want to be named, said he had tried to file the Safeguard paperwork at his local HSBC branch but staff did not know how to help him. 
As he was unable to fill in the forms, he said HSBC also threatened to shut the account.
Personal trainer Lumsden said he understands the reasons for the Safeguard program, but that his case shows the bank still has not fixed all the problems with it.
""A multi-billion pound bank like HSBC doesn't care if some gym in Tunbridge Wells moves its account somewhere else, but for a business like us these bank problems can have a massive impact. Whatever their system is, it isn't working.""

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares edged higher in muted trading on Tuesday as investors awaited the latest inflation figures from the United States, while results drove big moves in  Iliad  (PA:ILD) and E.ON . 
French telecoms company Iliad fell 6 percent even as it reported higher annual sales and profits for 2017, with traders pointing to flat fixed-line revenues in the final quarter.
It comes as Orange (PA:ORAN), Iliad rival and dominant French telecoms company, returned to growth last year for the first time since 2009 after spending heavily to roll out high-speed broadband. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 0.2 percent, with utilities a top-performing sector for a second day on plans by German utilities RWE (DE:RWEG) and E.ON (DE:EONGn) to divide up the assets of power utility Innogy (DE:IGY). 
E.ON (DE:EONGn) got a further boost to the top of the STOXX 600 on Tuesday, its shares gaining 4.4 percent after its results. The company said it would raise its dividends for 2018 and 2019.
M&A deals have multiplied in the European market recently, but investors said dealmaking was not at feverpitch.
""One thing I am very pleased not to see is the over-arching cross-industry deals which marked the apex of ambition in the early noughties,"" said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.
""That sort of reckless expansion and combination seems to be missing from the data, which suggests there is room for further growth,"" he added.
Other notable gainers included Swedish debt collector Intrum Justitia (ST:INTRUM) rose 6.2 percent to the top of the STOXX, with traders pointing to a note from SEB upgrading the stock to 'hold' from 'sell'. 
Traders said the strong price gains on the note were likely down to investors covering short positions on the stock which is down 10 percent so far this year.
Oil stocks were also strong boosts.  Total  (PA:TOTF) gained 1.4 percent after  Barclays  (LON:BARC) upgraded its rating on it, saying the French oil major is entering a new phase of growth in cashflow and production.
Struggling South African retailer Steinhoff (J:SRRJ) saw its Germany-listed shares rise 2.9 percent after it cut its stake in KAP Industrial (J:KAPJ) as it tried to plug a liquidity gap. 
A weaker full-year outlook sent chemicals group  Wacker Chemie  (DE:WCHG) down 4.1 percent. The firm said sales would slow due to currency pressures.
Veolia (PA:VIE) fell 2.4 percent, the top faller on France's CAC 40, after the Qatari government sold its 4.6 percent stake in the utility group.
Overall European company results have been encouraging. Investors said European earnings had further room to grow as they were still lagging the U.S..
""The European market isn't pricing in quite as much as the U.S. is, and it's in a more favourable part of the business cycle,"" said Rothschild's Gardiner. 

""We are aware that it's a pretty crowded story, but we still think it's very attractive,"" he added.

A year ago, Europe's largest automaker introduced new compensation rules for managers to curb investor criticism over big bonuses paid to executives in the wake of its 2015 ""dieselgate"" emissions scandal.
Mueller, 64, whose contract expires in 2020, earned almost a fifth more than the 8.6 million euros that  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche made for 2017, when Daimler's Mercedes-Benz brand beat rivals Audi (DE:NSUG) and BMW (DE:BMWG) in global luxury-car sales for a second year.
Volkswagen group nearly doubled its 2017 operating profit even as it pushes a costly strategic shift to electric and self-driving cars and grapples with its emissions scandal.
In 2016, Mueller had earned 7.3 billion euros under VW's then backward-looking remuneration system which allowed bonuses to be partly based on VW's performance over the previous two years.
Under the new rules, the carmaker's supervisory board capped total pay for its CEO at 10 million euros and other top managers at 5.5 million euros.
Under Germany's HGB commercial code, overall compensation of VW group's top executive board jumped 27 percent to 50.3 million euros last year from 39.6 million a year earlier, VW said. 
Sources at VW said Mueller's salary package exceeded the 10 million limit because of perks and retirement provisions that are usually included under HGB rules. Without those, the CEO would have earned about 9.5 million euros.

1163,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 10:35PM ET</span>",Japan Inc to raise wages but likely short of PM Abe's 3 percent target,"By Tetsushi Kajimoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Big Japanese companies are set to agree on Wednesday to raise wages for a fifth year but likely stop short of meeting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's 3 percent goal, adding to doubts the central bank will be able to hit its consumer price target.
The results of the ""shunto"" spring wage negotiations between corporate management and unions, announced by the big automobile and electronics companies, will set the tone for wage hikes across the nation and could provide hints about future consumer spending.
Abe has been campaigning for a 3 percent gain to spur consumption and banish the deflation that has dogged Japan's economy for nearly two decades. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has also urged a 3 percent raise to nudge up inflation to the BOJ's long elusive 2 percent target.
Wage growth is expected to accelerate given bigger bonuses, and rising pay at small firms and for part timers. Still, it won't reach Abe's 3 percent target or be strong enough to clear hurdles for the central bank to raise rates, some analysts say.
""The Bank of Japan won't move this year. It will probably wait to see results of next year's shunto,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities.
Even though many Japanese companies are sitting on piles of cash from healthy earnings, they are wary of boosting base salaries because that commits them to higher fixed personnel costs. Instead, they prefer one-off bonuses and other benefits.
Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), considered a bellwether in the country's annual wage negotiations, is set to raise base monthly salaries by more than 1,300 yen ($12.18) for the year beginning April, local media reported.
It marked the fifth straight year the automaker lifted workers' pay, but the increase is less than the 3,000 yen demanded by its union.
A Toyota spokeswoman said it was considering raising wages and other benefits, such as family allowances, so that all unionized workers would on average get a 3.3 percent -- or 11,700 yen -- boost in monthly payment.
Over the past four years, major companies agreed to raise wages about 2 percent each spring. The bulk of that - about 1.8 percent - comes automatically under Japan's seniority-based employment system. Anything beyond that is a hike in ""base pay.""
Several economists have forecast major companies would agree this year to base pay increases of 0.5-0.6 percent, which with the seniority-based automatic salary rise would lift wage growth to around 2.3-2.4 percent.
That would be above last year's 2.11 percent hike and in the neighborhood of 2015's 2.38 percent rise, which was a 17-year high.
However, there's a risk that wage gains could be offset by cuts in overtime pay in the coming year as companies come under pressure from the government to curb Japan's notoriously long overtime hours.
Also, rises in deductions for social security to service the rapidly aging population could cut into wage gains, analysts say.
Japan's unions tend not to be as aggressive in pressing their demands as those in the West because they attach greater importance to job security and maintain a sense of corporate loyalty.

1167,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 03:56AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco international listing looks increasingly difficult: sources,"By Rania El Gamal, Saeed Azhar and Alex Lawler
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is increasingly looking to just float oil giant Saudi Aramco locally as plans for an initial public offering (IPO) on an international exchange such as London or New York hang in the balance, sources close to the process said.
The kingdom is counting on being awarded emerging market status by index complier MSCI in June to help Saudi Aramco attract Western funds, in addition to cornerstone investors from China, Japan and South Korea, the sources said.
""I would guess it is about evens that there will be no international IPO,"" said a high-level source familiar with the preparations, saying they were proving to be a disappointment. 
Saudi Arabia is planning to list up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco in an initial public offering that could value it at up to $2 trillion and make it the world's biggest oil company by market capitalization.
Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said last week that Aramco was too important to risk listing in the United States because of litigation concerns, such as existing lawsuits against rival oil companies for their role in climate change.
British officials have been told by Saudi counterparts London has a chance to secure the listing but only in 2019 at the earliest, according to the Financial Times, and sources told Reuters the kingdom was now focusing on a listing on the local exchange, or Tadawul.
""The only thing we know today is that Tadawul will be the key listing location as our national exchange,"" Falih told CNN.
""We are waiting for the reforms to be in place and to join MSCI and Aramco listing in Tadawul will be catalytic for that capital market as we bring international capital to the kingdom,"" he told the U.S. channel last week.
MSCI FLOWS
The initial public offering is the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and it would also boost the kingdom's budget which has been hit by low oil prices.
Initially planned for 2018, preparations have been hit by rows over whether Aramco should list on major Western markets at all. An advisory council to the government asked the securities regulator this year to study the impact of a local listing amid concern a huge IPO could harm the market.
MSCI has proposed giving its existing Saudi Arabia stock index emerging market status rather than standalone status following a series of market reforms by the kingdom such as raising caps on foreign ownership of companies.
MSCI will give its decision in June and, if positive, the reclassification would be in two steps in May and August 2019.
According to an update of the MSCI proposal published in February, Saudi Arabia would have a market capitalization of $124 billion in MSCI's Emerging Markets Index, giving it an index weight of 2.3 percent, on a par with Thailand.
Based on the assumption that another $100 billion would be added through an Aramco initial public offering, the kingdom's weighting would rise to about 4 percent, which would be bigger than Russia's weighting of 3.4 percent, for example.
If MSCI grants Saudi Arabia emerging market status, it could be seen as a reason to push against an international listing, the sources close to the listing process said.
Passive investment funds that replicate MSCI indexes would need to put 4 percent of their funds allocated to emerging market indexes into Saudi shares to match the country weighting.
According to MSCI, $1.7 trillion of assets were benchmarked against MSCI emerging market indexes at the end of June last year, of which about a fifth was from passive investors.
That could mean $13.6 billion could come into Saudi stocks from passive investors and if active investors also increased their Saudi exposure to the weighting following an Aramco IPO the total inflows could be $68 billion.
Data published in March by fund tracking firm EPFR Global Funds found evidence that investors have warmed to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks. Looking at single country equity funds, Saudi Arabia attracted record setting flows as investors looked for alternatives to Russia and Turkey, the data showed. 
LIQUIDITY FEARS
With the prospect of a listing in London and New York receding, sources familiar with the IPO told Reuters that Hong Kong was now emerging as an increasingly likely compromise because Riyadh wants to help Asian nations that are expected to become cornerstone investors.
While London is preferred over New York, the requirement by both for greater disclosure of sensitive information on Aramco than the Hong Kong exchange is viewed as a drawback by some Saudi officials and advisers, the sources said.
Saudi Aramco said on Monday it was still reviewing its options for the initial public offering.
A final decision will be made by Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees the kingdom's economic and oil policies. 
Sources have told Reuters it requires a bourse at least six month to prepare for a listing so a decision would need to be taken in April for the IPO to go ahead this year.
Tadawul's chief said in October that his exchange hoped to be the only venue. But with a total capitalization of about $475 billion, it could struggle to absorb Aramco without the participation of foreign funds.
Sources close to the process, however, said even with emerging market status, Aramco would struggle to raise $100 billion locally. Bankers and analysts said an Aramco float risked drowning out other shares listed on Tadawul, given daily turnover now is about $1.6 billion.

""They can do a nominal 2 to 2.5 percent listing,"" one of the sources said.

1169,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 03:44AM ET</span>","Under pressure, ING scraps plan to raise CEO pay","By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Top Dutch financial services company  ING Groep  NV (AS:INGA) on Tuesday scrapped a planned 50 percent pay increase for CEO Ralph Hamers, bowing to pressure from politicians and the public.
The company's announcement last week that it would boost Hamers' total pay package to just over 3 million euros ($3.7 million) triggered a firestorm of protest from politicians, who are facing national municipal elections next week, as well as reports of customers closing their accounts in protest.
""We as Supervisory Board are responsible for this proposal and regret the commotion caused by it,"" Chairman Jeroen van der Veer said in a statement, adding the bank had ""underestimated the public response"" to the idea.
Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra on Friday said the government was considering blocking the plan by any means necessary, including passing a law to change it if needed.
""This deals directly with the confidence we should be able to have in the banking sector,"" Hoekstra said on Monday. ""ING is not a cookie factory, it is a systematically important bank.""
Van der Veer, a former Shell (LON:RDSa) CEO, had initially stood his ground against swelling criticism, arguing that Hamers has been underpaid for years. 
Even after the increase, Hamers' pay would have been below the average for heads of large banks and in line with packages for Dutch blue chip CEOs.
But the idea was met with disbelief among many voters, who recalled that the bank was bailed out by taxpayers during the 2008 global financial crisis, repaying the last of its aid in 2014.
The reaction among politicians was worse.
Parties representing 99 percent of the seats in parliament condemned the proposed wage increase, which instantly became a top issue ahead of municipal elections set for March 21.
Successive governments have tried to limit financial sector pay since the financial crisis, limiting performance bonuses, for example, to 20 percent of base salaries.
An attempt by the board of ABN Amro (AS:ABNd) to raise pay for executives in 2015 led to a delay of the company's re-privatization.
ING, which published its annual report and agenda for its annual meeting last week, must now wait until 2019 before proposing any new pay package for Hamers -- which shareholders must approve.
""To fulfill our duty to act in ING's long-term interests the Supervisory Board will carefully assess how it can develop a sustainable and competitive remuneration policy going forward,"" ING said.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) President Dan Ammann said on Monday the automaker's troubled South Korean operations can be a ""sustainable, profitable business,"" if unions and the South Korean government agree quickly on a restructuring.
GM has warned Korean officials the unit faces a ""cash crisis"" in the first quarter without new funding. Nearly 2 trillion won ($1.88 billion) of GM Korea's debts to its parent are due by end-March or early April, according to a regulatory filing.
‚ÄùTime is short and everybody must move with urgency,‚Äù Ammann told Reuters in an interview when asked if March 31 was a deadline for action.
The state-funded South Korean Development Bank said on Monday it had begun a due-diligence review of GM's South Korean unit as part of its decision whether to inject more capital into the money-losing operation.
GM officials have outlined plans to invest up to $2.8 billion in the South Korean operations and convert into equity about $2.7 billion in debt owed by the unit to the parent company, according to Korean government officials and a GM letter reviewed by Reuters. 
Ammann said that if the automaker, the South Korean government and unions can agree on a restructuring plan ‚Äúthere‚Äôs investment in the business, new product programs that we‚Äôd look to allocate"" to South Korea. 
""It's a classical restructuring where everybody needs to contribute something in order for everybody to end up in a better place with a sustainable, profitable business.‚Äù
New product investments would result in South Korea building vehicles that are part of GM's global product lineup and could be sold in other markets, Ammann said.
GM on Tuesday asked South Korea to designate its factory site in the city of Bupyeong as a foreign investment zone to be eligible for corporate tax benefits, an official at Incheon Metropolitan City told Reuters. 
The official declined to elaborate further on GM's proposal. 

To be eligible for the designation, manufacturers have to construct new factory facilities with foreign investment of more than $30 million, or invest more than $2 million in building or expanding research and development facilities.

1175,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2018 07:33AM ET</span>",New Boeing jet to accelerate services shake-up,"By Tim Hepher
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) is doubling down on its landmark new strategy designed to muscle in on the business of maintenance providers by making its next jet the laboratory for in-house services that could radically alter the global business model for selling planes.
Unlike Boeing's last all-new design, the 787 Dreamliner, its proposed new mid-market plane will not bring a flood of revolutionary technical designs to the drawing board.
But it will give the world's largest plane maker a chance to test its new business approach of designing the plane so that it generates lucrative services revenues for Boeing while also offering efficiencies to airlines over the aircraft‚Äôs decades-long lifespan.
Along with production costs, the new approach could help Boeing decide whether to invest the $15 billion or more in development needed to build the jet.
""If we decide to launch, it's a big investment and it's an investment that has to contemplate not only the product itself but all of our other strategic objectives,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters.
""So you can imagine we would want to look at this airplane through the lens of lifecycle value as we are growing our services business,"" he said.
Until recently, Boeing and Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) sold planes with little involvement in the way they were operated and maintained. Instead, that was work carried out by their own suppliers or third-party shops.
Heavy outsourcing on jets like the 787 expanded the trend by leaving suppliers - such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011), which supplies the 787's carbon wings - in command of key components.
While Boeing and others squeezed their balance sheets to launch jets, many of their suppliers used their design influence to forge profitable relationships directly with airlines as they conducted part swaps or repairs required by regulators.
""That seems a little out of balance, doesn't it?"" said Muilenburg, describing how the pendulum is now swinging back to give Boeing more control over parts and therefore the stream of aftermarket services that comes with owning a part's design.
""We do take the majority of the risk in developing new products, and we think that would cause us to want to gain the financial benefit of that risk-taking for the long term,"" he said. 
The long-term approach to the new jet is the latest evidence of changes in the $180 billion aero-aftermarket as planemakers jostle with suppliers - and even airlines - for control of repairs, training and data in pursuit of higher margins. 
Last year, Boeing centralized services formerly spread across the company in a new division with a goal to more than treble sales to $50 billion in a decade. 
The new unit posted operating margins of 15.4 percent last year, compared with 16.1 percent that United Technologies Aerospace Systems (N:UTX), a major supplier, earned from selling new equipment, services and aftermarket parts.
ENGINEERING DEPTH
The aftermarket is not entirely new to Boeing, and is common in defense, where Muilenburg ran services between 2008 and 2009. Airbus set ambitious internal targets last week and Canada's  Bombardier Inc  (TO:BBDb) is banking on maintenance.
But after airplane demand peaked since 2014, Boeing has turned more aggressively to parts and services to help meet a target of doubling margins to the mid-teens by 2020. Its core jet margin widened to 9.6 percent last year from 3.4 percent in 2016.
To support the strategy, Boeing is bringing back key in-house technology like avionics - the brains of a modern jet -partly with an eye to future aftermarket revenue.
""It is important that we build out vertical capabilities that sustain our engineering depth...as airplanes become more digital,"" Muilenburg said, adding that broader growth in the industry would also provide a boon to suppliers.
Suppliers say Boeing is also less willing than before to share risks - and profits - with them on the systems they do build. Instead it wants them to build to Boeing's designs rather than leaving them with keys to the all-important aftermarket. 
Already, there are signs the mid-market jet could see a swing away from risk-sharing towards straight procurement deals,the head of a major supplier told Reuters.
""It depends on the area of the airplane we are talking about but we are very clear in our intent to grow our services business, and part of that is bringing back inside some engineering and intellectual property,"" Muilenburg commented.
The downside of doing more by itself, suppliers and analysts say, is that Boeing could weaken access to outside innovation, import risk and tie up capital and finite engineering resources.
Depending on how far this goes, industry sources say it may also herald gradual changes in patterns of cash generation. 
While planemakers get paid on delivery, engine makers charge little upfront and make money on services provided over years. 
Some analysts say new plane manufacturer strategies suggest those business models could start to converge and put pressure on them to be more generous with discounts on jets.
Muilenburg declined to address pricing directly, but acknowledged Boeing's cradle-to-grave services strategy could have some impact on the timing of future income.

""The services business tends to be accretive to margin, but this does give us the flexibility of where we drive margin in the business with the idea of raising the bar overall,"" he said when asked if bundling services could lead to bigger jet discounts.

1181,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 09:03PM ET</span>",Noble Group's Options Narrow as Saga Heads for March 20 Crunch,"(Bloomberg) -- The moment of truth is approaching for Noble Group Ltd.
Nearly a year after a shock trading loss sent it spiraling toward collapse, the commodity trader is racing to reach a deal with a group of senior creditors before a $379 million bond maturity on March 20, according to people familiar with the matter.
""The clock is really ticking,"" said Jean-Francois Lambert, a consultant and former head of commodity trade finance at  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA). ""The domino effect of default would be like a tsunami.""
The March 20 bond maturity is shaping up to be the denouement of a drama that began more than three years ago when then-unknown Iceberg Research started publishing critiques of Noble‚Äôs accounting. Since then, the company has shrunk to a shadow of its former self, battered by trading losses and massive writedowns.
On Monday morning, Noble announced that it had decided not to pay a coupon on its 2022 bond that was due on Friday. While it has a 30-day grace period on the coupon, there is no such grace period on the 2018 bond maturity, according to the prospectus.
Firm Deal
The company said it was ""very close"" to reaching final terms on a restructuring deal with a so-called ad hoc group of largely hedge fund creditors, after announcing a preliminary deal in late January to halve its debt.
Yet even if it can secure a firm deal before March 20, Noble‚Äôs options are narrowing.
It‚Äôs still possible the company could decide to repay the bond, a Hong Kong restructuring lawyer told Bloomberg last week.
Still, after missing the coupon payment, the market is not pricing in much chance it will do so: the 2018 bonds are trading at roughly the same price as Noble‚Äôs bonds maturing in 2020 and 2022; and at 52 cents on the dollar any investor buying the 2018 bond today would almost double their money in a week if the company did repay on time.
Even with a deal, the road ahead looks tricky. The creditors in the ad hoc group are likely to agree not to take any legal action to enforce their claims against the company as part of the planned ""restructuring support agreement,"" but the deal won‚Äôt cover all investors in Noble‚Äôs debt until it has been implemented through a scheme of arrangement -- a process likely to take months.
Default Risk
In the meantime, not paying the 2018 bond on time would constitute an event of default, according to the bond‚Äôs prospectus. That could be avoided through a vote at an extraordinary general meeting of the holders of the bond -- but the company must give 21 days‚Äô notice of any such meeting, according to a copy of the trust deed. Alternatively, holders of 90 percent of the bond would need to agree in writing.
It‚Äôs not clear how much of the 2018 bond the ad hoc group holds. The company has said that the ad hoc group holds about 36 percent of its total $3.45 billion in unsecured debt, and that other creditors holding a further 15 percent ""have indicated their broad support.""
Two people familiar with the situation, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations, said Noble could decide to continue trading even after a default on the 2018 bond, on the basis that its deal with a large group of creditors would reduce the risk of any enforcement proceedings against it. Holders of at least 25 percent of the bonds must request enforcement, according to the prospectus. The alternative would be for the company to seek a debt moratorium in court, according to one of the people.
Paper Judgement
It wouldn‚Äôt be unprecedented for a company to continue operating despite a default, as long as bondholders don‚Äôt demand immediate repayment.
""If the company defaults on its bonds on March 20, that would be a black mark. But it may be more of a paper judgment,"" said Brayan Lai, Singapore-based analyst at credit research firm Bondcritic Ltd. He expects creditors to put in place some sort of forebearance agreement.
Still, Noble chairman Paul Brough said last month that it was ""important from a customer and supplier perspective that we are seen to be compliant with our borrowing obligations‚Äô"" explaining why the company decided to make a coupon payment in January.
Noble executives and their rivals at other traders expect that some key counterparties could walk away from long-term contracts with the company in the event of a restructuring or default, putting further strain on the business, Bloomberg reported in November.
""Can the new company survive and rebuild credibility with its various trading parties?"" asked Lambert. ""The jury‚Äôs out.""

LONDON (Reuters) - World shares inched higher on Tuesday, eking out limited gains as investors kept a wary eye on a U.S. inflation reading later in the day that could offer clues on the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes this year.
The MSCI All-Country World index of stocks, which tracks shares in 47 countries was up less than 0.1 percent. (MIWD00000PUS)
The index has recovered about half its losses during a violent shakeout in stocks in February. The selloff came on the back of strong U.S. wage numbers, which investors feared might feed into inflation and push the U.S. central bank towards a faster pace of monetary tightening.
(Graphic - Attempting recovery: http://reut.rs/2GlBgNo)
U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data is due at 1230 GMT.
""Today's CPI inflation data is likely to add further color to the US inflation picture, however it probably won‚Äôt add any further clarity to the overall inflation outlook puzzle, given that the Fed doesn‚Äôt use CPI as its inflation benchmark,"" said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London.
""Nonetheless it is still a useful gauge in establishing when and how the price pressures we‚Äôve been seeing build up in US supply chains start to filter down into the wider economy."" 
While the consumer price index is a popular barometer of economic health, it is not the primary gauge the Fed uses to determine whether it is meeting its mandate of price stability. Instead, the Fed uses the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) index.
European shares opened positive, with the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gaining 0.1 percent. Italian and Spanish stocks rose 0.3 to 0.4 percent, while Britain's FTSE (FTSE) was a laggard, down 0.1 percent.
Earlier in Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) was up 0.2 percent after spending much of the day swerving in and out of negative territory.
The index surged 1.5 percent on Monday following firm U.S. jobs numbers on Friday, while low wage growth eased concerns about inflation and faster central bank rate hikes.
But a mixed performance by U.S. shares overnight tempered the rally.
The S&P 500 (SPX) and the Dow (DJI) slipped on Monday as the U.S. tariffs signed into law last week weighed on industrials, while a rise in tech stocks boosted the Nasdaq (IXIC) to a new record high. 
POLITICS PRESSURES YEN, BOOSTS SLOVAK BOND YIELDS
In currencies, the Japanese yen fell over half a percent to a two-week low against the dollar, pressured by a political scandal engulfing Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government. It also lost ground to the euro. 
The yen tends to suffer in an environment when riskier and higher-yielding assets are bid but  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists said in a note that a further deterioration in the political situation that affected the position of Abe, could see the yen ""forcefully return towards its previous upward trend.""
The dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.2 percent.
""The broader story remains that of U.S. monetary policy normalization in the backdrop of an improving economy and a further decline in currency market volatility would only fuel more risk taking appetite,"" said Commerzbank's FX strategist Thu Lan Nguyen.
Slovakia's 10-year bond yield rose as much as five basis points and the cost of insuring exposure to its debt hit the highest in almost three months as the country's government inched towards collapse. 
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico's government moved closer to collapse on Monday after his junior coalition partner called for early elections amid a political crisis sparked by the killing of a journalist.
The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield (US10YT=RR) stood little changed at 2.879 percent.
In commodities, crude oil prices staged a recovery after sliding on concerns over rising U.S. output. 
U.S. crude futures (CLc1) were up 0.2 percent to $61.51 per barrel. Brent (LCOc1) also rose 0.2 percent to $65.08 per barrel. 
Spot gold fell 0.2 percent to $1,318 per ounce.

1183,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 08:45PM ET</span>",General Electric axes top-executive bonuses for first time,"NEW YORK (Reuters) -  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co last year eliminated bonuses for its senior managers for the first time in its 126-year history, saving millions of dollars after losing money in 2017, the industrial conglomerate said on Monday.
All but one of its top executives did not receive a bonus, the company said. The changes led to steep declines in compensation and reflected the company's poor results in 2017, according to the company's annual proxy.
Former CEO Jeff Immelt, who stepped down on Aug. 1, received $8.1 million in 2017, down from $21.3 million the year before. Compensation includes salary, bonus, stock, options and other income. GE eliminated Immelt's 2017 target bonus of $5.4 million and cut about $1 million from his salary.
Current Chief Executive John Flannery earned $9 million in salary and other compensation last year. The company eliminated a $3 million target bonus for him, GE said.
The company also eliminated bonuses for former Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein, former Vice Chair of Business Innovations Beth Comstock and John Rice, the former CEO of GE's global growth organization. The savings on bonuses and other compensation totaled more than $10 million.
The exception was David Joyce, head of GE's aviation business, who received about $5.2 million. While that was down from $12.6 million in 2016, Joyce received a $1.4 million bonus.
""We are holding leaders accountable for performance,"" GE said in the proxy, noting operating profit fell 11 percent and that the amount in its bonus pool fell 75 percent. GE reported a net loss of 72 cents a share last year.
""Consistent with this commitment to align pay to performance, the bonuses we paid were concentrated in Aviation and Healthcare, which had outstanding years,"" the company said.
GE said in the proxy it was not changing compensation for board members, other than to add a $30,000 annual payment for members of the new finance committee.

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) President Dan Ammann said on Monday the automaker's troubled South Korean operations can be a ""sustainable, profitable business,"" if unions and the South Korean government agree quickly on a restructuring.
GM has warned Korean officials the unit faces a ""cash crisis"" in the first quarter without new funding. Nearly 2 trillion won ($1.88 billion) of GM Korea's debts to its parent are due by end-March or early April, according to a regulatory filing.
‚ÄùTime is short and everybody must move with urgency,‚Äù Ammann told Reuters in an interview when asked if March 31 was a deadline for action.
The state-funded South Korean Development Bank said on Monday it had begun a due-diligence review of GM's South Korean unit as part of its decision whether to inject more capital into the money-losing operation.
GM officials have outlined plans to invest up to $2.8 billion in the South Korean operations and convert into equity about $2.7 billion in debt owed by the unit to the parent company, according to Korean government officials and a GM letter reviewed by Reuters. 
Ammann said that if the automaker, the South Korean government and unions can agree on a restructuring plan ‚Äúthere‚Äôs investment in the business, new product programs that we‚Äôd look to allocate"" to South Korea. ""It's a classical restructuring where everybody needs to contribute something in order for everybody to end up in a better place with a sustainable, profitable business.‚Äù

New product investments would result in South Korea building vehicles that are part of GM's global product lineup and could be sold in other markets, Ammann said.

Kudlow, a CNBC contributor, is a long-time friend and informal adviser to Trump. It was unclear how soon Trump would make up his mind.
Chris Liddell, a former executive at  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), is also under consideration for the job, a White House official said on Sunday.
Trump is searching for a new director for the White House National Economic Council after Cohn, a former  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS) president, said he would resign. Cohn‚Äôs decision came after Trump decided to put tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to Trump who promoted the tariffs, has also been touted as a candidate for the top economic job, though he has said he is not in the running.

Liddell, 59, has earned respect at the White House for his work on projects like information technology modernization and electronic health records, which have required intensive coordination with government agencies, the official said.

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Europe's drinks sector tells EU it will offer more product info,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's drinks sector announced plans on Monday to inform consumers more about the energy content and ingredients in beer, wine and spirits in a self-policing move, but critics said much of this information would only be available online.
Alcoholic beverages have been exempted from EU labeling rules that came into force in December 2014 for all other food and drinks, but the European Commission called on the sector to come up with a proposal this year to regulate itself.
Seven trade bodies, covering beer, wine and spirits, gave their voluntary commitment on the issue to EU Health Commissioner Vytenis Andruikaitis, who will be responsible for analyzing the proposal.
The European alcoholic beverages sector said it was committing to providing nutrition information and the list of ingredients of their products.
This information would be provided to consumers online, possibly with a web-link or QR code on the label itself to allow consumers easier access.
The energy values would be provided per 100 millilitres, as for standard drinks, but could also be available per typical serving, something the spirits industry has been keen on because of the smaller measures used for the likes of whisky or gin.
""We ask the Commission to consider allowing energy on spirits labels to be given more prominently per serving size than per 100 ml,"" said Ulrich Adam, director general of industry group spiritsEUROPE, which represents national organizations and multinationals such as  Diageo  (LON:DGE) and  Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP).
The brewing sector said that over 70 percent of beers in the EU already list ingredients on the label. Separately, some countries have already set stricter measures for alcohol labeling, such as Austria, which requires producers of some wines to disclose the amount of sugar per serving. 
EU consumer organization BEUC said the proposal allowed manufacturers to choose between on-label or online information and that the latter was unsatisfactory as consumers made shopping decisions in seconds.
""It is unrealistic to expect they will take a few minutes to check online how calorific wine or vodka is,"" BEUC director general Monique Goyens said in a statement, adding also that about 30 percent of EU consumers did not have a smartphone.
A group of public health associations also expressed reservations and urged the Commission to dismiss the proposal.

""We do not have to go online to find information for milk or orange juice, why should we for wine?"" said Mariann Skar, secretary general of European Alcohol Policy Alliance.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 04:50PM ET</span>",New York financier Lynn Tilton puts Zohar funds into bankruptcy,"By Tom Hals and Jonathan Stempel
WILMINGTON, Del./NEW YORK (Reuters) - Colorful New York financier Lynn Tilton has put her Zohar investment funds, a key element of her distressed-debt empire and the subject of several legal battles, into Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with a goal of selling assets or refinancing debt.
Tilton said in papers filed on Sunday night with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Del., that the filing was prompted by litigation with the funds' current manager, restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal, and bond insurer MBIA Inc (N:MBI), a major creditor.
The Zohar funds were designed as collateralized loan obligations that bundled loans to troubled companies into securities, and had raised about $2.5 billion from investors.
Tilton, who was briefly the subject of a reality TV show called ""The Diva of Distressed,"" once ran the funds through her investment firm Patriarch Partners but gave up control in 2016 to Alvarez & Marsal.
Tilton was cleared of wrongdoing over the Zohar funds twice last year, winning dismissals in September of U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission claims that she bilked investors of $200 million, and in December of a racketeering lawsuit brought by the funds themselves.
In an affidavit, Tilton said the bankruptcy will not affect operations at her 25 operating businesses, which employ more than 50,000 people and include Dura Automotive, MD Helicopters, Rand McNally and Stila Cosmetics, and will put lawsuits on hold.
She said litigation has blocked her from selling one company and financing several others, but the funds retain ""tremendous value"" and are worth ""billions of dollars,"" and a bankruptcy would let creditors with valid claims be paid in full.
According to the bankruptcy petition, the Zohar funds have up to $10 billion of assets and up to $1 billion of debt.
""Value cannot be maximized in the litigious and charged atmosphere that currently exists,"" Tilton said in a statement. ""Chapter 11 is the only path forward.""
The Delaware Supreme Court had been scheduled on March 21 to hear Tilton's appeal of a lower court ruling awarding control of three companies to the Zohar funds.
""These bankruptcy filings are nothing more than a last grasp by Ms. Tilton to retain control of companies she does not own,"" Bryan Marsal, chief executive of Alvarez & Marsal, said in a statement.
MBIA had no immediate comment. According to court records, MBIA has insured about $1.04 billion of notes issued by the Zohar funds.
Mark Kirschner, of Goldin Associates, was named chief restructuring officer for the funds.

The case is In re: Zohar III Corp, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware, No. 18-10512.

1. U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) To Show Inflation Remains Subdued?
U.S. inflation data as measured by the consumer price index (cpi) is expected to show inflation remained subdued in February, further dampening expectations for a faster pace of rate hikes in 2018.
Analysts expect year-on-year inflation remained unchanged at 1.8% in February.
Expectations for sluggish U.S. consumer prices growth come amid recent data showing wage growth slowed in February despite U.S. labor market tightening after the economy created 313,000 jobs in February.
Second-tier economic data in the form of NFIB Small Business Optimism for February is forecast to show an improved reading of 107.1 from the previous reading of 106.9.
The dollar started the week on the back foot against a basket of major currencies as investors continued to fear the prospect of a trade war would negatively impact the U.S. economy.
2. U.S. crude oil stockpiles to show third straight weekly build?
Traders look ahead to a fresh batch of crude oil inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute due Tuesday.
The American Petroleum Institute reported crude oil stockpiles rose by 5.661 million barrels for the week ended March 2. That differed significantly from the Energy Information Administration weekly reported - released a day later ‚Äì showing crude supplies rose by about 2.4 million barrels last week.
Crude oil futures made a poor start to the week settling at $61.36 a barrel, down 1.10% amid fears over ramp up in U.S. output. The EIA said Tuesday it expects U.S. shale output to climb by 131,000 barrels a day in April to 6.954 million barrels a day.
3. UK Spring Statement To Unveil Budget Plans For Post-Brexit Britain
Chancellor Philip Hammond is expected to unveil the smallest UK budget deficit in nearly 16 years, when he presents his spring statement on Tuesday 07.30 a.m. ET.
The UK economy grew 1.7% in 2017, above the UK Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast of 1.5% growth released during the chancellor‚Äôs November budget statement. The OBR is expected to upgrade its forecasts for economic growth Tuesday.
Investors are also expected to closely scrutinize the chancellor‚Äôs plans for UK public spending in the post-Brexit era.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 03:40PM ET</span>",Has Spotify answered its royalty problem?,"By Subrat Patnaik
(Reuters) - In its much-anticipated filing to go public last month, Spotify revealed revenue growth was outpacing costs, suggesting the music streaming service was striking deals with the music industry that defeat the central tension in its business model.
Spotify launched in 2008 and is now available in more than 60 countries, but a big question mark over its model remains whether it can find enough subscribers and other revenue to pay for the mountain of royalty fees to record labels and artists.
The filing by the Sweden-based firm for a direct listing as SPOT on the New York Stock Exchange showed revenue rose 39 percent to 4.09 billion euros ($5.05 billion) in 2017.
Cost of revenue - which mainly consists of royalty paid to music record labels and music publishers - rose 49 percent in 2016, but just 27 percent last year, the company's documents showed. 
Spotify attributes the fall to a cut in content costs following new licensing agreements with record labels and music publishers, it said in the nearly 200-page filing. 
(GRAPHIC: Spotify's revenue growth outpacing costs - http://reut.rs/2FnOQi0)
Spotify pays fees to music publishing companies such as Sony/ATV Music Publishing, Warner Music and Vivendi's Universal Music Group who act for artists ranging from Justin Timberlake to unknown indie bands in exchange for a commission. 
To pay for that, it has some 71 million premium subscribers globally, about twice as many paying customers as its closest rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with 36 million as of February. Including those who listen to advertising-supported streams, Spotify has about 159 million monthly average users (MAUs).

Nearly 60 percent of Spotify's monthly users were ad-supported subscribers in 2017. However, at a headline $9.99 a month, premium customers generated 90 percent of total revenue from listeners in the same period.

There may still be problems ahead. 
Many industry figures say the streaming revolution, led by Spotify, has crippled the commercial logic of recording music as a profession. Radiohead and Taylor Swift have been among high-profile dissidents; both have returned to the service. 
In January, U.S. copyright authorities decided to increase over the next five years royalty payments music streaming companies like Spotify and Apple must make to songwriters and music publishers, a trade association for music publishers said. 
While the revenue/cost-of-revenue balance is improving, Spotify's net loss is widening - doubling last year to 1.24 billion euros from 539 million euros in 2016. Its operating loss widened to 378 million euros in 2017 from 349 million euros.
That suggests the company will need to use its clout to strike more lucrative deals in the coming years if it wants to turn a profit from a growing subscriber base as it battles Apple, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).

By naming Solomon sole president, the firm cleared the way for him to take the helm, a scenario that analysts say allayed the concern some investors had about there possibly being co-CEOs when Blankfein retires. They also cited Solomon‚Äôs diverse background and investment-banking expertise as benefits, and said Goldman‚Äôs transparency in laying out the succession plan will help insiders at the firm focus on doing business instead of wondering who‚Äôs going to take over as CEO.
Goldman shares jumped as much as 1.7 percent to a record high, while the KBW bank index fell as much as as 0.7 percent.
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Mike Mayo
Mayo continues to recommend investors buy Goldman stock, as this management transition is likely ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù than having a co-CEO, an outsider, or a delayed decision that would trigger uncertainty inside the firm.
Sees Goldman as poised to exceed earnings expectations, given improving markets, and notes Solomon ran ‚Äúthe best growing part of Goldman‚Äù for a decade before assuming the COO position 15 months ago. ‚ÄúThe challenge and opportunity, in our opinion, is for Goldman to better monetize its corporate CEO relationships for deeper activities with both banking and trading.‚Äù
RBC, Gerard Cassidy
Cassidy sees Solomon as Blankfein‚Äôs likely successor and notes that legislative and regulatory changes ‚Äúhave taken a toll‚Äù on the firm‚Äôs core trading businesses in the past 10 years.
Without ‚Äútrue‚Äù regulatory or legislative relief for the company, Goldman will need to continue to transform itself into a more profitable company by growing its wealth and asset management, investment banking, and lending businesses, while its markets business needs to broaden its range of clients away from active trading customers, like hedge funds.
KBW, Brian Kleinhanzl
‚ÄúAnnouncement is a modest positive since it removes the risk that there could have been co-CEOs upon Blankfein‚Äôs retirement and that structure can be unwieldy.‚Äù
KBW sees Solomon as ‚Äúa capable leader,‚Äù with significant experience running the investment bank, and a longstanding member of Goldman‚Äôs management committee.
UBS, Brennan Hawken
‚ÄúSolomon is well versed in many areas of the firm.‚Äù UBS sees expansion into new businesses likely to continue under Solomon, given his diverse background -- in other words, ‚Äúnot another trader.‚Äù
As performance within the trading division has faced clear headwinds over the past couple of years, ‚Äúa change in leadership may provide fresh perspective‚Äù as the firm strives to achieve more than $5 billion in net revenue opportunities over the next few years.
Adds that naming Solomon as sole COO and president indicates transition is nearing. ‚ÄúThe increased transparency also likely puts insiders more at ease,‚Äù so that they can focus on running the company rather than being distracted with succession.
Compass Point, Charles Peabody
‚ÄúIf you look at the strategic plan that they put out last September, the majority of the $5 billion of incremental revenue growth was going to come from a financing-type situation. And financing is the lead product of the investment bank,‚Äù the analyst said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. ‚ÄúSo we saw the future as more of an investment banking future than a securities or trading future and that favored Solomon.‚Äù"

1224,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 01:21PM ET</span>",Britain's Melrose raises GKN bid to $11.2 billion in final offer,"By Sarah Young and Ben Martin
LONDON (Reuters) -  Melrose  Industries (L:MRON) increased its hostile offer for GKN (L:GKN) by around 10 percent to 8.1 billion pounds ($11.2 billion), trying to win over investors after the British engineering firm struck a rival deal of its own last week. 
GKN's board unanimously rejected the new bid on Monday saying it continued to fundamentally undervalue the company. 
But Melrose declared its sweetened offer as ""final"", meaning it cannot improve the terms further under British takeover rules. As a result, GKN shareholders must choose between the bid and the engineer's own turnaround plan.
Under the revised offer, GKN investors would receive 81 pence in cash for each GKN share plus 1.69 new Melrose shares. The previous offer made in January was 1.49 new Melrose shares plus 81 pence cash.
GKN shares fell 2.2 percent to 425.5 pence by 1556 GMT, compared to the 467 pence per share initial value of Melrose's final offer.
Shares in Melrose, a UK-based industrial turnaround specialist, fell 5.1 percent to 213.2 pence, dragging down the value of the bid to 441.3 pence.
GKN, which makes parts for car companies and aircraft manufacturers, cited the impact of Melrose's share price fall on the value of the bid as a reason for spurning the offer.
However,  Aviva  Investors, which holds stakes in both companies, said GKN shareholders should back Melrose's sweetened bid.
""We believe the interests of shareholders in both companies are best served by accepting Melrose‚Äôs raised bid,"" David Cumming, Aviva Investors' chief investment officer for equities, said. 
The asset management arm of Aviva (L:AV) owns almost 1.2 percent of GKN and 5.4 percent of Melrose.
As part of its defense, GKN struck a $6.1 billion deal on Friday to merge its automotive business with U.S. company Dana Incorporated (N:DAN), offering GKN shareholders a 47.25 percent stake in the enlarged, U.S.-listed group.
GKN has also pledged to return 2.5 billion pounds to investors in the next three years following the Dana deal and an earlier pledge to sell its powder metallurgy business.
The engineering group said on Monday it believed it would be worth 503 pence a share given its plans for improving the company. 
But Aviva's Cumming described GKN's plan as a ""reactive review of its business structure"" and said Aviva Investors favored Melrose's ""proposed measured execution of value."" 
A hedge fund investor, who has built a stake in GKN since the engineering company disclosed Melrose‚Äôs bid in January, also said the new offer was high enough for Melrose to win.
""It was a little bit better than we thought,"" he told Reuters. 
Melrose argued on Monday that GKN's Dana deal was ""ill-thought-through"" and would face regulatory hurdles. 
ALTERNATIVE PLAN
GKN said in its latest defense, also published on Monday, that shareholders would be invested in a more profitable GKN Aerospace following the sale of Driveline and powder metallurgy, plus have holdings in the merged GKN-Dana company.
The engineering firm, which can trace its roots back to 1759, is attractive to buyers because of its involvement with growing aircraft programs such as the A350 and the A320, and in cars, where it has been growing market share and supplies manufacturers including Fiat Chrysler and VW Group. 
But it was left vulnerable to predators after two profit warnings late last year, caused by problems at its U.S. aerospace business.
Melrose's potential takeover of GKN has prompted worries from British politicians about UK jobs being lost and the country's engineering know-how ending up in foreign hands.
GKN employs around 6,000 people in Britain -- about 10 percent of its workforce.
Politicians were also concerned that Melrose could break up GKN and sell parts to foreign buyers, potentially compromising British and U.S. national security because of GKN's work on defense programs -- the company makes components for the Eurofighter Typhoon combat jet.
Melrose told lawmakers earlier in March that it would consider making binding commitments about the future of GKN should its bid succeed.
The deadline for GKN shareholders to accept Melrose's offer is March 29.

1240,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",U.S. states slow Trump offshore oil drilling expansion plan,"By Jessica Resnick-Ault
HOUSTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration's plan to broadly expand drilling in U.S. offshore waters is moving slowly due to opposition from coastal states and indifference from oil companies that have turned their focus to other opportunities.
The administration hopes encouraging U.S. energy development outside of shale oilfields will further its goal of ""energy dominance."" But existing Obama administration lease rules remain in place through 2022 unless the new rules gain approval. 
The Department of the Interior this year proposed opening vast new acreage in the U.S. outer continental shelf to drilling. The comment period wrapped up March 9. Still, Secretary Ryan Zinke said last week he remained deep in discussions with state governors, some of whom have thrown up roadblocks that would impede or bar drilling off their coasts. 
A new outer continental shelf lease program proposes 47 lease sales, including areas that had not been offered since 1983. At least 12 states have sought exemptions, and Zinke has agreed to exclude areas off Florida.
""On the five-year plan we made everything available to look at,"" Zinke told Reuters at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. Governors from across the West Coast and much of the East Coast are meeting with the Interior and objecting to areas off their states for drilling. State discussions could last through year end.
So far, officials in Alaska, Maine, Georgia and U.S Gulf Coast states other than Florida have said they were open to expanding drilling. California and other states have said they would deny needed permits for onshore services or transport.
""You can't bring energy ashore unless you have access to state waters,"" Zinke said. 
While oil companies say they have met with Interior officials on Gulf of Mexico access to new regions, Zinke said they must go through the official comment process.
""They know my position: we put everything on and will go line by line,"" he said.
While Washington continues to discuss the opening with states, oil companies are turning to well-mapped basins in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and other nations were deepwater drilling or auctions are ongoing, like Brazil, Mexico and Guyana. 
""We are constantly scouring the planet to really understand resource potential,"" said Steve Pastor, BHP Billiton's (AX:BHP) president of petroleum operations. The Gulf of Mexico has some of the best discovered potential, he said. 
BHP has previously explored acreage in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, at its Sake project, in a formation off the coast of Alabama. 
Proposed new lease areas along the U.S. Atlantic coast would require seismic mapping and development of infrastructure that would take time. ""I can't put a fine point on whether we would pursue it,"" Pastor said. 
 Chevron  Corp (N:CVX), which disclosed a large Gulf of Mexico oil discovery in existing lease areas earlier this year, said new areas will have to stack up against existing projects. 
They ""will have to compete with the other drilling we have in the world,"" said Robert Ryan, Chevron's vice president of global exploration. ""We just don't know, most of those areas haven't been evaluated yet."" 
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), which is active in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, said it was encouraged by the additional Gulf acreage that is opening under existing lease sales. Costs, including a recent 25 percent tariff on imported steel, would be an issue. 

""We know what we like here,"" said Wael Sawan, Shell's executive vice president of deepwater. ""We're encouraged by some of the elements but then some things like steel tariffs raise a question mark,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's move to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports has rippled through financial markets, but stocks appear to be shrugging off the potential for a broader global trade war, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) strategists.
As Trump's tariff plans to levy steel imports at 25 percent and aluminum at 10 percent have come to light in recent weeks, shares of companies that will face higher costs because of those tariffs have underperformed.
But other sections of the economy that could be vulnerable to retaliation from U.S. trading partners have held up, according to Goldman, even as the bank's economists believe such retaliation is likely. 
Shares of agriculture firms, luxury consumer companies and tech companies with high imported cost of goods sold ""have generally demonstrated no signs of concern,"" the strategists wrote.
""Although equity prices have moved in reaction to the proposed metals tariffs, investors do not appear concerned about escalating trade conflict,"" Goldman said in a research note.
The broad S&P 500 (SPX) has recovered since Trump initially announced his tariff plans, which caused a one-day shock to stocks.
Since Feb. 28, the day before Trump's announcement, the S&P 500, which is the benchmark for large-cap stocks that includes many multinational companies, is now up 2.7 percent. Over that time, the small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) has outperformed, rising 5.7 percent. 
Investors have said that small-cap stocks have become more appealing because of their focus on the domestic market, shielding them from risks from a trade war. 

But Goldman said ""positioning and earlier underperformance appear more likely causes than trade concerns"" for the Russell's recent strength.

The presidential order reflected a calculation that the United States' lead in creating technology and setting standards for the next generation of mobile cell phone communications would be lost to China if Singapore-based Broadcom took over San Diego-based Qualcomm, according to a White House official.
Qualcomm has emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China's Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL] in the sector, making Qualcomm a prized asset. 
Qualcomm had earlier rebuffed Broadcom's $117 billion bid, which was under investigation by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a multi-agency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews the national security implications of acquisitions of U.S. corporations by foreign companies.
In a letter on March 5, CFIUS said it was investigating whether Broadcom would starve Qualcomm of research dollars that would allow it to compete and also cited the risk of Broadcom's relationship with ""third party foreign entities.""
While it did not identify those entities, the letter repeatedly described Qualcomm as the leading company in so-called 5G technology development and standard setting.
""A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States,"" CFIUS said. ""While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.""
NATIONAL SECURITY AND HUAWEI
A White House official on Monday confirmed that the national security concerns related to the risks of Broadcom's relationship with third party foreign entities.
A source familiar with CFIUS' thinking had said that, if the deal was completed, the U.S. military was concerned that within 10 years, ""there would essentially be a dominant player in all of these technologies and that's essentially Huawei, and then the American carriers would have no choice. They would just have to buy Huawei (equipment).""
Huawei has been forging closer commercial ties with big telecom operators across Europe and Asia, putting it in prime position to lead the global race for 5G networks despite U.S. concerns.
Huawei has a dominant position in China, which is set to become the world‚Äôs biggest 5G market by far, and has also made inroads in the rest of world to compete with rivals such as Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Nokia (HE:NOKIA) in several lucrative markets, including countries that are longstanding U.S. allies.
Qualcomm is also a major player in 5G, estimated to have 15 percent of 5G-essential patents in the world, compared with 11 percent for Nokia and 10 percent for all of China, according to a Jefferies report citing LexInnova research. Many smartphone makers are counting on Qualcomm to deliver its 5G chipset on time in late 2018 to roll out their 5G phones in 2019.
Shares of Broadcom rose less than 1.0 percent to $264.10 in after-hours trade while Qualcomm fell 4.3 percent to $60.14.
Broadcom said it was reviewing the presidential order. ""Broadcom strongly disagrees that its proposed acquisition of Qualcomm raises any national security concerns,"" it said in a statement in response to the decision. 
Qualcomm, which had delayed its annual shareholder meeting during the CFIUS review, set the new date for March 23.
The move by Trump to kill the deal comes only months after the U.S. president himself stood next to Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan at the White House, announcing the company's decision to move its headquarters to the United States and calling it ""one of the really great, great companies."" 
This is the fifth time a U.S. president has blocked a deal based on CFIUS objections and the second deal Trump has stopped since assuming office slightly over a year ago. 
""The proposed takeover of Qualcomm by the Purchaser (Broadcom) is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,"" the presidential order released on Monday said.
The order cited ""credible evidence"" that led Trump to believe that Broadcom's taking control of Qualcomm ""might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.""
BROADCOM'S NEXT MOVE
Broadcom had struggled to complete its proposed deal to buy Qualcomm, which had cited several concerns including the price offered and potential antitrust hurdles.
The presidential decision to block the deal cannot be appealed. However, it is not clear what rules Broadcom would have to follow if it goes ahead with announced plans to move its headquarters to the United States.
Companies may challenge CFIUS's jurisdiction in court but may not challenge the inter-agency panel's national security findings, a CFIUS expert said.
If Broadcom decides to press on with its effort to buy Qualcomm, it would be wise to drop the matter for now while the company quietly wraps up its move to the United States, a second CFIUS expert said. Once the move is done, Broadcom could argue that CFIUS does not have jurisdiction, the second expert said.

Both spoke privately to protect business relationships.

1257,By Business Insider,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 11:17AM ET</span>",Disney is set to dominate Netflix in the battle to be 'the world's leading content company',"Move over  Netflix.  Disney is poised to dominate as ""arguably the world's leading content company,"" an RBC Capital Markets analyst says.
With the  21st Century Fox deal awaiting regulatory approval, the tie-up, which includes video-streaming service Hulu, could result in Disney spending roughly $30 billion annually on content, RBC's Steven Cahall estimates. This will put the company ""in a league of its own,"" he said.
By comparison, Netflix plans to spend anywhere from $8 billion on  new and original content in 2018, in addition to marketing. 
""We conclude that DIS remains among the best in the biz, with a valuable opportunity to match NFLX in streaming, and benefits from the FOXA deal and Hulu,"" Cahall wrote in a note to investors.
Disney also has the advantage of using its unparalleled customer engagement, as well as its theme parks and cruises, to draw an organic and global audience.
Cahall estimated that the number of subscribers the entertainment company could bring in just from families going on Disney-themed vacations is around 50 million unique households. Moreover, the fan bases of Star Wars and Marvel, composed of adults and children alike, is not factored into that estimate, suggesting Disney could have a much wider subscriber audience. 
Aside from Disney's mass appeal to families, Hulu also offers a way onto the screens of a more adult-centric audience. Hulu already has more than 17 million subscribers and Disney could spend $15 billion annually to add to the platform's content offerings and attract a growing audience, Cahall adds.
""The potential scale of DIS DTC [direct-to-consumer] + Hulu is the real deal,"" Cahall said. 
For every 1 million subscribers, Netflix gets $1.3 billion in market cap, Cahall calculates. At this ratio, a couple million Disney and Hulu subscribers would result in a potential 20% upside to the current share price.
Cahall boosted Disney's price target to $135 per share, roughly 30% above its current share level.
Disney's stock was trading at $104.93 per share on Monday. It was down 6.16% for the year.

(Reuters) - Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) has been ordered by a federal judge to face much of a lawsuit in the United States claiming that the personal information of all 3 billion users was compromised in a series of data breaches.
In a decision on Friday night, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California rejected a bid by  Verizon Communications  Inc (NYSE:VZ), which bought Yahoo's Internet business last June, to dismiss many claims, including for negligence and breach of contract.
Koh dismissed some other claims. She had previously denied Yahoo's bid to dismiss some unfair competition claims.
Yahoo was accused of being too slow to disclose three data breaches that occurred from 2013 and 2016, increasing users' risk of identity theft and requiring them to spend money on credit freeze, monitoring and other protection services.
The breaches were revealed after New York-based Verizon agreed to buy Yahoo's Internet business, and prompted a cut in the purchase price to about $4.5 billion.
A Verizon spokesman had no immediate comment on Monday. A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The plaintiffs amended their complaint after Yahoo last October revealed that the 2013 breach affected all 3 billion users, tripling its earlier estimate.
Koh said the amended complaint highlighted the importance of security in the plaintiffs' decision to use Yahoo.
""Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to show that they would have behaved differently had defendants disclosed the security weaknesses of the Yahoo Mail System,"" Koh wrote.
She also said the plaintiffs could try to show that liability limits in Yahoo's terms of service were ""unconscionable,"" given the allegations that Yahoo knew its security was deficient but did little.
In seeking a dismissal, Yahoo said it has long been the target of ""relentless criminal attacks,"" and the plaintiffs' ""20/20 hindsight"" did not cast doubt on its ""unending"" efforts to thwart ""constantly evolving security threats.""
Last March, U.S. prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers in connection with one of the Yahoo breaches.
One accused hacker, Karim Baratov, a Canadian born in Kazakhstan, pleaded guilty in November to aggravated identity theft and conspiracy charges. The other defendants remained at large in Russia.

The case is In re:  Yahoo Inc  Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-md-02752.

1270,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 10:31AM ET</span>",What Trade War? Foreign-Facing Stocks Keep Beating the S&P 500,"(Bloomberg) -- Free-trade proponents might be out of fashion at the White House, but not in the U.S. equity market.
A  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). basket of U.S. stocks that derive the bulk of sales abroad has outperformed the S&P 500 Index since March 1, the day that President Donald Trump rattled financial markets with a surprise announcement that his administration will impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
While the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 420 points March 1, it‚Äôs rallied almost 3 percent since as investors grow more confident that the most severe protectionist policies won‚Äôt become reality.
‚ÄúAlthough equity prices have moved in reaction to the proposed metals tariffs, investors do not appear concerned about escalating trade conflict,‚Äù David Kostin, Goldman‚Äôs‚Äô chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients late Friday. ‚ÄúThe strong growth environment helps explain the resilience of equity prices and investor sentiment.‚Äù
That‚Äôs not to say the proposed tariffs don‚Äôt pose a threat to equities, Kostin added. While the levies announced so far will have a trivial effect on U.S. activity, Goldman‚Äôs economists believe retaliation from major trading partners is likely.
‚ÄúThe larger threat to corporate earnings and equity valuations is the potential for escalating trade conflict in response to these tariffs,‚Äù Kostin wrote.
Bloomberg Intelligence analysts estimate that if the U.S. raises import costs by 10 percent and the rest of the world retaliates by lifting tariffs on U.S. exports, the cost by 2020 would be 0.5 percent of global GDP. That would amount to $470 billion, Jamie Murray and Tom Orlik wrote in a note Monday.
And a peek at the underbelly of the equity market suggests investors see little reason to price in that risk, remaining confident that the Trump administration isn‚Äôt spoiling for a fight. Goldman says the outperformance of domestically focused small caps in the Russell 2000 this month has to do with positioning and the months of prior underperformance.
Indeed, Canada and Mexico have already been exempted from the tariffs indefinitely as renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement continue. Australia may also avoid the taxes, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said discussions regarding further exemptions will be ongoing. Trump himself has given the European Union an out, tweeting that if the bloc drops ‚Äútheir horrific barriers & tariffs,‚Äù he‚Äôll spare it.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 01:04PM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs' Schwartz retires, paves way for Solomon as next CEO","By Catherine Ngai
(Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) unexpectedly announced on Monday that Harvey Schwartz will retire from the bank, leaving David Solomon as sole president and chief operating officer and the most obvious successor to Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein.
Schwartz and Solomon were named co-COO in December 2016 in a setup that appeared to pit the two against each other to eventually lead what is viewed as the most powerful U.S. investment bank.
The Wall Street bank's board had discussed choosing a single COO at a meeting in February as part of ongoing succession planning and decided on Solomon, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Speculation over the next leader had intensified after the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Blankfein, 63, was expected to retire as soon as this year and the bank was not looking beyond Schwartz and Solomon to replace him. Goldman did not comment on that report. 
Schwartz's retirement eliminates a presumptive CEO candidate with a strong trading background and comes as Goldman Sachs has been trying to reinvent itself after market trends and regulations sapped profits from its once-lucrative trading business. 
Schwartz, 53, will leave on April 20. He had been co-head of the bank's trading division before being promoted to chief financial officer in 2013, while Solomon, 56, had been a co-head of investment banking at Goldman since 2006 until becoming co-COO.
In September, Schwartz had outlined a target to grow revenue by $5 billion a year, after investors pressured the bank to be more transparent about its strategy outlook after two quarters of weak trading results.
Setting up an investment banker to lead the firm would better align leadership with the bank's focus and highlights the waning influence of the trading business,  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Mike Mayo said.
""This will be the first time in over a decade that a banker will be heading Goldman instead of a trader,"" he said. ""It sets a tone that the bankers are going to steer the ship incrementally more than the traders."" 
The bank typically maps out its succession planning by naming two or three candidates to top roles. Schwartz and Solomon were named to the co-COO roles after Gary Cohn left Goldman to become U.S. President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser. 
Cohn said last week he would resign, a move that came after he lost a fight over Trump's plans for hefty steel and aluminum import tariffs.
Goldman shares rose nearly 1.4 percent to hit a lifetime high in morning trade, and last traded up 0.7 percent at $272.69 by midday. 

Analysts viewed Schwartz's retirement as a positive for the bank because it clarified the succession planning and appeared to remove the possibility of the bank having co-CEOs.

1280,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 09:31AM ET</span>",Exclusive: CFO says he left Dubai-based private equity firm Abraaj,"By Hadeel Al Sayegh, Tom Arnold and Stanley Carvalho
DUBAI (Reuters) - The chief financial officer of Dubai-based Abraaj Holdings told Reuters he had left the embattled private equity company.
Two other senior executives are also preparing to leave, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The investment firm, which manages $13.6 billion in assets, is also considering a round of job cuts, they said.
Abraaj has shaken up its management, suspended new investments and undertaken a review of its corporate structure following a dispute with four of its investors over the use of their money in a $1 billion healthcare fund.
Abraaj has always denied reports that it misused the money but the scandal at the Middle East's largest private equity firm is seen to have taken the shine off a fast-growing sector in the region.
The investors include the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Bank's IFC arm. Officials at the Gates Foundation and IFC have declined to comment on the dispute.
Ashish Dave, Abraaj's CFO and partner, confirmed that he had left the firm.
""I resigned six months ago to spend time with my family and pursue other opportunities,"" he told Reuters on Sunday.
A new chief financial officer, appointed from within the company, would be announced soon, one of the sources said.
CEO Arif Naqvi, who founded the firm in 2002 and turned it into a major emerging market investor , stepped aside from running the fund, Abraaj Investment Management Ltd, in February. He will remain chief executive of Abraaj Holdings, which was separated from the fund as part of the changes.
The three sources said that Mustafa Abdel‚ÄêWadood, managing partner and global head of private equity, and Ahmed Badreldin, head of MENA private equity, informed Abraaj several months ago that they wanted to leave but were asked to stay on to help support the company during a difficult period.
Badreldin told Reuters by phone that he had not resigned from the company.
An Abraaj spokeswoman said both Badreldin and Abdel-Wadood were still in their positions at the firm.
""Ahmed (Badreldin) remains a partner and head of the MENA region...,"" she said in an emailed statement.
She also referred Reuters to its statement on February 23 that said Abdel-Wadood continues in his full-time role as member of the Global Investment Committee and as managing partner of Abraaj Investment Management Ltd.
CUTTING JOBS
A round of job cuts are also expected at the firm, the sources said, but the newly appointed co-chief executives have yet to make a final decision on the matter.
The spokeswoman did not comment on the job cuts. The statement said that Abraaj had announced a comprehensive re-organisation of its business and an independent review of its structure. The review is expected to be completed within a few weeks.
Abraaj said last month it had appointed KPMG in January to look into the finances of the healthcare fund and within days it said the auditor had completed findings and verified all payments in line with agreed procedures.
The four investors had separately hired forensic accountants Ankura Consulting to investigate how money was used in the Abraaj Healthcare Fund, a source close to one of the firms told Reuters last month. Ankura did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Last week, Abraaj told Reuters in an email that the firm had begun freeing large investors from millions of dollars in capital commitments after deciding to suspend its new fund.
In the last year, Abraaj has seen other high profile departures due to friction over the company's rapid growth, two of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. They said the departures included Tom Speechley, a partner and former head of the firm's North America business, and Walid Bakr, a managing director who focused on Egypt.
They could not be reached for comment and the Abraaj spokeswoman declined to comment.

Bafin started an investigation last year after HNA bought Deutsche Bank shares to become the lender's largest shareholder.

LONDON (LPC) - Senior participants are warning that today‚Äôs market could be as good as it gets, despite a robust global economic backdrop and buoyant mood in the private equity and leveraged loan markets. 
Comparisions to 2007's pre-crisis conditions are becoming more common and industry figures are debating whether today's robust conditions constitute a bubble, as purchase prices rise, jumbo buyouts proliferate and deal terms become more aggressive. 
""I think we're now in bubble territory,"" said Frode Strand-Nielsen, founder of Nordic private equity firm FSN Capital.
Leveraged buyout purchase price multiples hit a record high of 11.2 times average Ebitda in 2017 and average buyout sizes also hit a new record of US$675m in the third quarter of 2017, up from 10 times in 2016, according to a recent report by Bain & Co.
Increasingly large buyout loans have been announced this year, including Blackstone‚Äôs US$20bn buyout of Thomson Reuters‚Äô Financial and Risk division (TO:TRI), and the upcoming ‚Ç¨10bn carve-out of Akzo Nobel‚Äôs specialty chemicals division.
Blackstone (NYSE:BX) is buying a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters‚Äô Financial and Risk unit, which includes LPC.
Strong debt markets are currently seeing good investor demand, but private equity firms are targeting companies that they can take through a recession, Gregor Bohm, co-head of Carlyle‚Äôs European buyout business, said at Berlin‚Äôs SuperReturn conference.
‚ÄúYou have to sell all the companies that you don‚Äôt want to hold through a recession,‚Äù he said. 
The next five years could be a difficult environment for private equity and leveraged credits, Strand-Nielsen said, particularly as buyouts that have been financed with cheap debt will get more expensive if interest rates rise.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of financial engineering, which usually indicates we‚Äôre going into a concerning environment,‚Äù he said at SuperReturn. 
The spectre of monetary tightening as the European Central Bank ends its Quantitative Easing programme is consistently highlighted as the biggest risk facing the market this year, among many, as global tensions rise. 
SAME BUT DIFFERENT? 
While private equity firms and bankers are aware that they are at the top of the market, benign borrowing conditions could persist for some time, allowing borrowers to lock in cheap debt. 
‚ÄúBorrowers are enjoying peak funding conditions,‚Äù said Ed Eyerman, head of European leveraged finance at Fitch in London.
Comparisons with 2007 overlook the fact that the leveraged loan market has fundamentally changed due to covenant lite lending - which did not exist a decade ago - and a larger and more diverse institutional buyside.
Although the lack of covenants is causing concern, bankers point to Spanish fashion retailer Cortefiel's [CTRFL.UL] 2014 amendment and extension of ‚Ç¨1.4bn of debt and 25% covenant headroom increase.
This bought time for the operating business to improve and allowed Cortefiel to return to the debt markets last year, but other companies may not be so lucky. 
""Cortefiel was the poster child for cov-lite lending but you can‚Äôt assume all will do that well,‚Äù a market analyst said.
Co-president Scott Sperling said that Thomas H. Lee Partners is focusing on less cyclical growth businesses which are better positioned to weather a downturn that could have a similar magnitude to the last financial crisis.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly not a brave new world that includes no cycle,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur base case incorporates a recession of the size of 2008. The swings can be reasonably violent so you have to recognise how that could affect capital structures.‚Äù
CORRECTION INEVITABLE?
The global macroeconomic backdrop is also stronger than 2007 and private equity firms are continuing to benefit from broad-based global economic growth, Sperling and Eyerman said.
Interest rates are rising, but are expected to stay lower for longer than before the financial crisis, which is unlikely to affect companies‚Äô debt-servicing ability in the short term.
Fixed charge cover ratios, which measure how comfortably businesses can meet operating costs,¬†are also higher in leveraged companies than before the crisis.
The type of companies borrowing has also changed with the rise of software and business services with fewer assets and higher free cash flow margins, that require less onerous credit protections, Eyerman said.
‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have the capex and fixed costs of pre-2007 leveraged credits in sectors such as auto supply and building materials,‚Äù he said.
Despite lower debt servicing costs, some still think the market's record nine-year bull run is simply be delaying the inevitable correction, which will only make it more painful.

""We‚Äôre watching a movie where we know what the ending is,‚Äù said Guthrie Stewart, global head of private investments at PSP Investments. ‚ÄúJust not how long it is until we get there.‚Äù

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks advanced on Monday, with gains in shares of chipmakers and technology giants helping Wall Street extend last week's rally that was powered by U.S. jobs data.
Gains in Apple (O:AAPL), Amazon (O:AMZN) and chipmakers Broadcom (O:AVGO) and Micron Technology (O:MU) drove the S&P 500 higher.
Broadcom rose 2.9 percent following report that Intel (O:INTC) was considering a possible bid for the company. 
 General Electric  (N:GE) rose 2.2 percent and was the biggest boost to the Dow. 
The advances followed a near 2 percent gain for the main indexes on Friday after data showed sluggish wage growth in February, easing concerns about the Federal Reserve moving too fast on interest rate hikes.
""The market was particularly optimistic that wage growth wasn't too hot for fear of inflationary concerns,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.
Traders of U.S. short-term interest-rate futures kept bets the Federal Reserve will stick to three rate hikes this year.
A month ago, the markets were gripped by fears of higher wages leading to price pressures, triggering a selloff that dragged the main indexes to correction territory.
However, the S&P and the Dow have nearly reclaimed those losses. Rapid gains in technology stocks have already powered the Nasdaq (IXIC) back to its record levels. 
At 9:35 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) was up 0.23 percent at 25,394.24. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 0.17 percent at 2,791.32 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) gained 0.25 percent to 7,579.83.
Last week's gains were also supported by U.S. President Donald Trump's softer stance on his decision to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum by exempting Canada and Mexico.
Investors will pore over the next round of data on consumer prices and retail sales due this week for signs of rising price pressure.
Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by 0.62 percent gain in consumer discretionary stocks (SPLRCD). 
 Oclaro  (O:OCLR) jumped 25 percent and was the most traded stock after laser and optical fiber specialist Lumentum Holdings (O:LITE) said it would buy the optical components producer for $1.7 billion. Lumentum's shares rose 3.8 percent.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,592 to 877. On the Nasdaq, 1,509 issues rose and 860 fell.

1298,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 06:22PM ET</span>",Dropbox IPO price range puts valuation nearly a third below peak,"By Heather Somerville and Diptendu Lahiri
(Reuters) - Dropbox Inc (O:DBX) on Monday offered a price range for shares in its initial public offering that would value it at up to $7.1 billion, nearly a third below the valuation it commanded in 2014, a clear sign of how overheated the private tech market became a few years back. 
Cloud storage company Dropbox is the largest tech IPO after a protracted dry spell, and investors are carefully watching it for signs of how other highly valued tech companies will be received by the public markets. If Dropbox is a barometer for public market sentiment, it appears that investors will not endorse the valuations that many billion-dollar-plus startups now command.
The spring calendar for technology offerings is relatively busy, including cyber security company Zscaler's planned debut later this week and music company Spotify's expected listing early next month.
San Francisco-based Dropbox set a price range of $16 to $18 per share, which would raise up to $648 million in the highly anticipated public offering planned for Friday. The range serves as guidance, and the company will set a final price, based on investor feedback, on the eve of the IPO. 
The pricing is about a 30 percent drop from the $10 billion valuation Dropbox earned in early 2014 after a financing round led by BlackRock Inc (N:BLK). The company, which started as a free service to share and store photos, music and other large files, has raised more than $600 million from private investors.
New investors ranging from mutual funds to hedge funds began piling into startups a few years ago in hopes of earning better returns than the public markets offered, driving a spike in investments beginning in 2014 that came with outsized valuations.
Now, Dropbox's valuation cut suggests other companies that similarly raised a lot of money at high valuations but remain unprofitable, such as Uber Technologies Inc, may face a valuation decrease when they, too, go public. 
""Dropbox is still loss-making and its revenue is not enough to justify a market value of $10 billion,"" said Phil Davis, chief executive of Phil's Stock World, an investment advisory service. ""The price had to come down to lure in the investors.""
While venture financing remains high, startup valuations have mostly stabilized in the United States. 
""GROSSLY OVERVALUED UNICORNS""
Dropbox competes with much larger companies such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google,  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) as well as main rival Box Inc (N:BOX). It long struggled to monetize a product that many of its larger rivals offer for free and moved to offer more products for businesses, such as file synch and group collaboration tools.
The efforts appear to have paid off. Revenues grew by 31 percent to $1.1 billion in 2017 over the prior year, and losses narrowed by almost half to $112 million. Last year, it had positive free cash flow of $305 million, more than double the previous year.
By comparison, revenue at Box, which started two years before Dropbox, is expected to increase 25 percent to about $506 million this fiscal year from a year earlier. Box, which also is not profitable, went public in 2015. 
Dropbox's $7.07 billion valuation, based on the high end of its IPO price range, is two-and-a-half times that of Box's $2.85 billion market capitalization.
Despite its progress and four years of growth, Dropbox's financial performance still does not justify its 2014 valuation, some investors say.
Eric Schiffer, chairman and chief executive of the Patriarch Organization, a private equity firm, said Wall Street had rational figures for ""grossly overvalued unicorns,"" using the term for startup companies valued at $1 billion or more. 
""The IPO is a slap in the face to investors of the 2014 round"" of Dropbox, he added. Dropbox, co-founded in 2007 by Andrew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, has 500 million users across 180 countries. But most use the free service - about 11 million are paying customers.
Upon completion of the public offering, Dropbox will sell $100 million worth of common stock at the IPO price to the venture capital arm of Salesforce.com Inc (N:CRM) in a separate private placement, the company said.

Houston is the largest shareholder and will retain 24 percent of Dropbox after selling 2.3 million shares in the offering. Sequoia Capital is the largest shareholder among outside investors, with about a 25 percent stake.

1300,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 08:39AM ET</span>",Singapore-based Broadcom to redomicile to U.S. by April 3,"(Reuters) - Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd (O:AVGO) said on Monday it expects to redomicile to the United States by April 3, two days before the chipmaker's acquisition target  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) holds its annual shareholder meeting.
Broadcom's $117 billion offer to buy California-based Qualcomm is being reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for potential national security threats.
Broadcom said such security concerns were not a risk to the closure of the proposed buyout as it never planned to finish the deal before completing moving its official base to the United States.
Broadcom is incorporated in Singapore and co-headquartered there and in San Jose, California.
Broadcom said last week that CFIUS has ordered the company to provide it with five business days' notice before taking any action toward moving base to the United States.
The requirement showed that CFIUS, an inter-agency panel led by the U.S. Treasury, was aware that its jurisdiction could be contested if Broadcom redomiciles to the United States.
CFIUS had delayed Qualcomm's annual meeting by a month to April 5. In that meeting, shareholders will also vote for Broadcom's slate of six nominees for Qualcomm's 11-member board.
Since disclosing its first bid, worth $103 billion, for Qualcomm on Nov. 6, Broadcom has revised its bid twice, but is yet to strike a deal.
Days before the first bid in November, U.S. President Donald Trump said Broadcom planned to redomicile to the United States from Singapore.

MILAN (Reuters) - European shares hit their highest level in almost two weeks on Monday, boosted by gains among German utilities after the sector's leading players announced a major overhaul of the industry. 
Innogy soared 12 percent after parent RWE and rival E.ON said they would break up Germany's largest energy company by market value and divide up its assets. 
The deal would give E.ON greater economies of scale in power distribution and retail and RWE in renewables, making it easier for them to cope with Germany's rapid shift to cleaner energy sources. RWE and E.ON, whose share prices collapsed over the past decade, rose 7.5 and 5 percent respectively.
 Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said the agreement could be a win-win deal, with larger networks and retail businesses for E.ON and a long term renewables strategy and a stable dividend for RWE.
Shares in utilities in other countries rose on optimism for further M&A in the sector. 
The STOXX utility index rose 1.4 percent to lead sectoral gainers in Europe, helping the pan-European STOXX 600 index rise by 0.3 percent by 0920 GMT to its highest since Feb. 28.
Germany's DAX was up 0.7 percent, while the UK's FTSE dipped 0.1 percent on weaker commodity stocks.
Among top gainers were GKN (LON:GKN), up 1.2 percent after Melrose increased its hostile bid for the UK automotive engineer, appealing to investors after the company struck a rival deal of its own last week. Melrose fell 2.4 percent. 
The autos sector index rose 0.6 percent, brushing off a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump in which he threatened to impose taxes on European autos imported into the U.S. if the EU retaliates in a row over steel tariffs.

The top faller on the STOXX was Just Eat , down 4.3 percent, following a downgrade to ""sell"" from  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn). 
""Along with 2017 results, new CEO Peter Plumb announced an investment plan to expand into the delivery services business. While we think this move is strategic to defend Just Eat's leadership position against increased competition, it will come

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 03:01AM ET</span>",Long-only Japanese investors scoop up Japan shares,"By Ayai Tomisawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese retail investors bought about 1 trillion yen ($9.37 billion) of domestic stocks over the past six weeks as they saw bargain hunting opportunities after the recent sharp slide, helping to put a rough floor under the market.
Buying by Japanese retail investors using cash, and not margin trading, reached a net 980 billion yen between the fourth week of January and the last week of February.
In February, they were net buyers of Japanese stocks on a monthly basis for the first time since March 2017, the data showed.
""It's long-term money that's going to serve as a shock absorber when the market slides, just like how pension funds' buying supports the market's weakness,"" said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Securities. 
""Unlike institutional investors, retail investors don't have to worry about quarterly performances, so even if there is a short-term downside risk, they tend to buy cheap quality stocks in order to hold for two to three years.""
After hitting a 26-year high of 24,129.34 points in mid-January, the Nikkei share average (N225) slumped to below 21,000 points, a level not seen since October, hammered by Wall Street's rout stemming from rising inflation worries and fears of a global trade war.
Retail investors' buying cushioned the blow from 2.1 trillion yen of net selling by foreign investors, whose activity has a massive impact on the Japanese market due to its size, for the past eight weeks.
Japanese shares also have been helped in the last few sessions on hopes of easing tensions over North Korea.
But market watchers say Japanese stocks, in particular steelmakers, are likely to remain under pressure after the United States imposed tariffs. 
Trump has offered the possibility of excluding other allies, on top of Canada and Mexico, from the planned tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Tokyo has sought such an exemption.
""For now, the market seems relieved with Trump's decision to exempt NAFTA partners. It's not like there will be a trade war immediately, but there is still uncertainty,"" said Takashi Ito, equity market strategist at Nomura Securities.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 02:31AM ET</span>",UBS sees 'business as normal' as it contests Hong Kong suspension,"By Jennifer Hughes and Julie Zhu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) has told staff that it is ""business as normal"", after the Swiss bank revealed on Friday it is fighting an 18-month suspension in Hong Kong from leading initial public offerings (IPOs).
In an internal memo sent by Andrea Orcel and David Chin, global and Asia-Pacific heads of UBS's investment bank, respectively, and seen by Reuters, the bank told staff that until its appeal was heard ""we are business as normal"" and that it could still sponsor IPOs.
UBS disclosed the suspension by Hong Kong's securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), in its annual report released on Friday, and added it planned to appeal the decision as well as a HK$119 million ($15.18 million) fine handed out to it.
The bank did not specify what led to the suspension and the fine but said the regulator had been investigating UBS's role as a sponsor of some IPOs listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and that the actions related to one of the offerings under investigation. 
UBS, on Monday, declined to comment on the memo. 
The Swiss bank is a leading IPO bank in Hong Kong and the threat of suspension comes as the city - Asia-Pacific's most lucrative in terms of IPO fees for international banks - is gearing up for a series of potential blockbuster floats.
Hong Kong IPOs need at least one sponsoring bank and sponsors typically lead the work - collecting a larger proportion of the fees - as the deal progresses. Any company forced to change sponsor during its IPO process - such as because of a sponsor's suspension - must begin the whole listing process all over again, potentially adding months of work.
The 18-month duration of UBS's suspension is longer than the six months that many bankers in Hong Kong had expected.
In the memo, UBS said that it would still be able to work on IPOs, including as a joint global co-ordinator - a rung lower than sponsoring - even if the proposed suspension is upheld. 
The bank also told staff that it expected the full hearing of the appeal to be held in the fourth quarter of this year and a final decision to made early in 2019. 
The proposed punishments stem from an investigation by the SFC into the listing of China Forestry in 2009. The company was suspended in 2011 and is now being wound down.
The China Forestry IPO was sponsored by UBS and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN). On Friday, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Appeals Tribunal granted the two banks an extension for their appeals against the SFC's actions, but did not specify the punishments.
Standard Chartered, which closed its Hong Kong equities unit in 2015, declined to comment.
UBS has been a leading sponsor of IPOs for each of the past 10 years, sponsoring 10 per cent of all companies that have listed on Hong Kong's main board over that period, according to data from Dealogic. 
Since the news broke in 2016 of the SFC's investigation into both banks, UBS's sponsorship share has fallen to 3 per cent of total main board IPOs in 2016 and 2 percent in 2017.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 07:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Mexican state pension fund spent millions on failing builder - sources,"By Christine Murray
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's state workers' pension fund plowed more than $20 million into ICA (MX:ICA) and became the largest shareholder as the builder spiraled toward insolvency, according to people familiar with the matter, with the fund's investment set to be wiped out in a restructuring. 
PensionIssste, which manages about 195 billion pesos ($10.5 billion) of mostly government workers' retirement money, became the largest shareholder in ICA, with a stake of almost 10 percent, said three people with knowledge of the investment who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Many details of the transaction are not publicly available and none of the parties involved were willing to comment.
Half-way through 2015, ICA shares had sunk more than 50 percent from the year earlier as a crash in the peso had increased its heavy dollar-denominated debt load and lower government infrastructure spending led to a cash crunch.
Despite that PensionIssste began to buy up ICA shares and spent around 400 million pesos ($21.5 million) at an average price of around 7 pesos per share, one source said.
ICA, formally known as  Empresas ICA  SAB de CV, finally stopped making debt payments in December 2015, a fall from grace for what had once been Mexico's largest construction company.
Tapen Sinha, a professor at Mexico's ITAM University who specializes in risk management and pension funds, said funds should avoid such volatile stocks right off the bat.
""It's not for no reason something drops 50 percent,"" he said. ""There should be alarm bells (going) off in risk management inside PensionIssste."" 
Pensions regulator Consar examined the purchases, its president, Carlos Ramirez, said, adding that the deal complied with existing rules.
Details on the holdings of Mexican pension funds are not public. PensionIssste did not respond to emailed questions or a call for comment.
ICA and four subsidiaries filed a prepackaged bankruptcy agreement in August 2017, leading to the suspension of trading in the shares at 1.48 pesos.
Last Monday, ICA said a judge had approved its creditors agreement, which was accepted by a majority of debtholders. 
Unlike PensionIssste, one investor who opted for debt over equity is set to benefit from ICA's restructuring plan.
Mexican financier David Martinez's vehicle Fintech lent ICA $215 million in 2016 and under the restructuring plan, will be the largest shareholder in the company that emerges from bankruptcy, according to documents on ICA's website.
PensionIssste and other ICA shareholders will see their holdings diluted to 0.01 percent of the company, according to the documents.
The fund has asked banking and securities regulator CNBV to investigate whether ICA violated Mexican securities law, two of the sources said. PensionIssste is seeking to determine whether ICA failed to disclose important information to the market during its bankruptcy process, one source said.
ICA declined to comment on a list of questions submitted by Reuters. The CNBV said under law it could not comment.
It was not clear what PensionIssste, which changed its management team last year, could achieve with its claims, especially since ICA's restructuring plan has been approved.
Sinha, the ITAM professor, said it was unlikely the fund would recover anything in the process.
""Too bad. That's the risk you take when you buy stocks,"" Sinha said.

1317,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 01:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China's CEFC was scrambling for loans as authorities swooped¬† ¬†,"By Julie Zhu and Engen Tham
HONG KONG/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - CEFC China Energy, the once-acquisitive conglomerate, was prepared to pay annual rates of as much as 36 percent for short-term funding in a sign of the cash crunch faced by the company as authorities were closing in on its chairman, according to multiple people with knowledge of the matter. 
Earlier this month it was revealed that Ye Jianming, the company's chairman, had been investigated for suspected economic crimes. Guosheng Group, an investment firm owned by the Shanghai government, was tasked with evaluating CEFC's financial position as part of a restructuring and takeover process, according to two sources with knowledge of the moves. 
But from at least the second half of last year CEFC was approaching shadow bankers - non-traditional lenders - for costly short-term loans, said six sources with direct knowledge, in a sign of the strained liquidity the company was facing.
In early January, CEFC borrowed 1 billion yuan ($158.00 million) from the Shanghai-based Bida Holding Group, also known as U.Trust Holding Group, for a 15-day loan with a daily interest rate of 0.1 percent, equivalent to an annual interest rate of 36 percent, said one person with direct knowledge of the matter. 
The company also approached Shenzhen Qianhai Everbright Financial Holding Investment Management, Zhejiang-based Wanxiang Trust and Hebei-based Bohai International Trust, a unit of HNA Capital, for expensive loans, said people with direct knowledge of each respective company.
Qianhai Everbright and Bohai International Trust were tapped for M&A funds to finance deals, while Wanxiang was approached for money for corporate financing.
None of the companies lent to CEFC for reasons ranging from concerns over liquidity and opaque ownership to difficulties appraising asset value and timing issues, trust sources said. The rates of interest discussed was unclear. However, annual rates on short-term trust loans can be as high as around 12 percent, the sources said.
CEFC said the information of its expensive loans mentioned in the story is ""not correct"", without giving further comment. Guosheng, the Shanghai government, Bida, Qianhai Everbright and Bohai International Trust did not respond to requests for comment. Wanxiang Trust declined to comment.¬†
""CEFC has no cash and is solely relying on outside money"" to keep the company running, said one of the people who has knowledge of CEFC's debt situation. ""It remains a question how it's going to repay all the debt coming due."" 
DEBT DUE
The Shanghai-based conglomerate has around 44 billion yuan ($6.94 billion) of short term borrowing due by the first half of 2018, according to its 2017 half-year financial report disclosed to onshore bondholders.
Its total debt amounted to 117 billion yuan at the end of June, compared to total assets of 169 billion yuan. It reported a 2016 net profit of 4.5 billion yuan.
Trust lending in China is not as tightly regulated as bank activity, allowing trusts to charge higher rates of interest to borrowers who may struggle to access more traditional forms of finance. 
""Paying ultra-high interest rates is a sign of intense demand for cash,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.
""Clearly, the leadership in Beijing is putting pressure on CEFC to raise funds quickly to reduce its debt load or pay off specific creditors, such as state-owned banks,"" said Collier. 
CEFC's single largest source of financing has been China Development Bank (CDB) which was also expected to play a large role in funding CEFC's $9.1 billion purchase of a 14.16 percent stake in Rosneft, the Russian oil major, announced last year.
Nomura, one of the banks initially tapped for finance, was later told to step down as CEFC was set to raise $5.1 billion in short-term loans from Russia's second-biggest lender, VTB, according to a separate source with direct knowledge of those discussions. CEFC was in separate talks with CDB to later refinance the short-term bridge loan being offered by VTB, Reuters reported at the time.
CDB and Nomura didn't respond requests for comment. 
Zheng¬†Zhijie, president of CDB, said last week that the bank was not involved in financing the Rosneft stake purchase by CEFC. 
""We have not received an application seeking financing, how can we start considering?"" he told Reuters.
Asked how CEFC has performed over its current loans to CDB, Zheng said: ""So far they've made all repayments on time.""¬†
CEFC Shanghai International Group, a subsidiary of the group, has bonds worth 10.1 billion yuan maturing this year, according to Reuters data. In addition, bondholders will be able to exercise options to sell an additional 3 billion yuan of bonds back to the company in December. 

China Lianhe Credit Rating Co., a domestic credit ratings agency, earlier this month downgraded CEFC Shanghai following media reports of an investigation into the chairman of its parent company.

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 08:45AM ET</span>","DowDuPont's Andrew Liveris steps down, names CEO for new Dow","(Reuters) - DowDuPont Inc chief Andrew Liveris will step down on April 1, making good on an earlier promise to retire as the company named existing managers to head its materials science unit when it is spun off as Dow next year.
Jim Fitterling, currently chief operating officer of the materials science unit, will become its chief executive under the Dow brand in a spin-off planned for the first quarter of 2019, the company said in a statement.
Fitterling's current Chief Financial Officer Howard Ungerleider will serve as Dow's CFO. Both men are Dow veterans and have worked extensively on the merger. 
Liveris, who headed U.S. President Donald Trump's Manufacturing Council until it was disbanded last year, was chief executive of  Dow Chemical  (NYSE:DOW) until 2004 and continued as executive chairman after its merger with DuPont (NYSE:DWDP) last year. 
He will remain as a director of the combined board until July 1, in keeping with previously announced plans to retire on that date.
""The plans announced today (are) the result of many years of working on a succession pipeline,"" Liveris told Reuters.
""Jim and Howard have been valued members of Dow's and my most senior leadership team and have each played a pivotal role in developing and executing Dow's market-driven strategy.""
He said the decision was made during the Christmas holidays.
Dow and DuPont completed their $130 billion merger in September. It plans to split into three separate units, starting with the materials science business by the end of the first quarter of 2019. 
Fitterling looked at synergies as Dow combined with DuPont, while Ungerleider worked on the shape of the spinoff.
A second specialty products unit will be called DuPont and the third agricultural unit Corteva Agriscience. Their spinoffs are expected to start by June 1, 2019.
Liveris did not say what he plans to do after retirement but said it could be something in the ""intersection of business and policy.""

U.S. data on Friday showed nonfarm payrolls surged by 313,000 jobs in February. Annual growth in average hourly earnings however slowed to 2.6%, tempering speculation the Federal Reserve would project four rate hikes this year instead of three.
The S&P 500 closed 1.7% higher, while the Dow and Nasdaq both added 1.8%.
Appetite for risk assets was also boosted near the end of last week as a controversial U.S. tariff plan turned out to be narrower than expected, easing speculation of a full blown global trade war.
Japan‚Äôs Nikkei gained 1.4% by 9:20pm ET, as investors continued to trim holdings in the yen on news that U.S. president Trump is preparing to meet with North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un.
Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite and the Shenzhen Component traded 0.3% and 0.8% higher respectively.
China has approved the removal of term limits for its president with constitutional changes passed on Sunday. Although not a directional driver, a report compiled by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) gathered some attention as it warned China and Hong Kong are among the economies most at risk of a banking crisis. Meanwhile, the Chinese government has ordered manufacturers in the city of Tianjin to cut emissions by at least 50%. The country‚Äôs industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment are due Wednesday.
Hong Kong‚Äôs Hang Seng Index jumped 1.4%. Retailer Prada SpA (HK:1913) surged 19.4% after its CEO Patrizio Bertelli said in the company‚Äôs latest earnings report that he was satisfied with the progress made in 2017, although net profit for the year was down 4.3% YoY.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2018 05:33AM ET</span>",World stocks bask in U.S. jobs data glow,"By Abhinav Ramnarayan
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks surged to a two-week high on Monday after strong U.S. jobs data at the end of last week helped take the edge off investors' concerns about the potential outbreak of trade war between the United States and other major economies. 
European shares shot up across the board, following their Asian counterparts, while emerging market currencies strengthened as investors bought up so-called riskier assets and sold ""safe haven"" securities such as gold and government bonds. 
Markets have been cheering Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls data which showed a hefty 313,000 rise in jobs, but also revealed that annual growth in average hourly earnings had slowed to 2.6 percent after spiking in January. 
This suggested that the world's largest economy is experiencing a combination of high growth and low inflation, referred to in the market as a ""Goldilocks"" trend; giving investors an incentive to buy assets such as equities and high-yield bonds without having to fear tighter central bank policy. 
""Friday's U.S. employment data was about as perfect a set of figures as you can get from a policy maker's point of view. The increase in jobs was nothing short of amazing,"" said Marshall Gittler, a strategist at ACLS Global, a currency brokerage. 
""In other words, it was a 'Goldilocks' report:¬† not too hot, not too cold, just right.""
As a result, the S&P500 surged more than 1.7 percent on Friday -- its second-best day of the year so far -- and the warm glow extended around the globe on Monday.
Germany's DAX led gains in Europe, rising 0.9 percent, and MSCI's world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, hit a two-week high. 
Earlier, MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 1.3 percent, poised for a third session of gains.
South Korea rose 1 percent, while Australia's main index added 0.7 percent, boosted by mining shares on news that Australia could be exempt from new U.S. trade tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
Concerns over those tariffs have been weighing on European stocks, with the main pan-European stock index hitting a seven-month low at the start of the month. It has recovered somewhat from that trough to rise 0.3 percent on Monday. 
The jobs news also lifted currencies such as the Mexican peso and Canadian and Australian dollars, while weighing on the safe-haven yen.
Those cross currents left the U.S. dollar a shade lower against a basket of currencies. Inflation data from the world's largest economy is due on Tuesday.
Investors had trimmed holdings of yen last week on news U.S. President Donald Trump was prepared to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a potential breakthrough in nuclear tensions in the region.
U.S. officials on Sunday defended Trump's decision, saying the move was not just for show and not a gift to Pyongyang.
""Now the U.S. is back to goldilocks at least for now, the tariffs are less severe, and Kim and Trump are to meet,"" said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based chief economist at AMP.
""We still expect more volatility this year as many of these issues have further go run, but the broad trend in shares likely remains up.""
Brent crude gave up some of Friday's gains, dropping 27 cents to $65.22 a barrel, as rising U.S. output loomed over markets despite a slowdown in rig drilling activity.
Gold prices also slipped 0.3 percent $1,320.46 an ounce.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 04:19PM ET</span>",Canada's steel town still nervous despite tariff reprieve,"By Allison Martell
HAMILTON, ONTARIO (Reuters) - A temporary exemption from U.S. tariffs is little comfort to the Canadian steel city of Hamilton, coping with months of uncertainty as U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a potentially devastating 25 percent duty unless the North American Free Trade Agreement is renegotiated.
Canadian negotiators are weighing the interests of the relatively small sector, responsible for about 22,000 direct Canadian jobs and C$9.0 billion ($7.0 billion) in U.S. exports, against those of bigger industries like auto manufacturing and politically influential groups like dairy farmers. 
""I don't think we're at the end of it. Now it's being used as leverage,"" said Hamilton Port Authority Chief Executive Officer Ian Hamilton. ""President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on everybody."" 
Hamilton, population 700,000, has pushed to diversify its economy, with better transit links to Toronto and affordable homes that are attracting families priced out of Canada's biggest city. 
A C$139-million project is underway to clean up coal tar that contaminates the harbor and condos are replacing once empty downtown storefronts. 
When Canadian steel escaped U.S. steel tariffs in 2002, the duties had diverted some cheap steel into Canada. In recent years, a global steel glut has made it difficult for Canadian mills to compete. 
But ArcelorMittal's Dofasco mill, coking and finishing operations at Stelco, and a collection of smaller operations still directly employ 10,000 people in Hamilton. 
The North American steel industry is heavily integrated, with raw materials, steel and parts crossing the U.S.-Canadian border several times before a finished product such as a vehicle or refrigerator is sold to consumers. About 65 percent of the Hamilton port's tonnage is iron ore and coal used to make steel.
Hamilton, the port president, said one steel company called after Trump first signaled the tariffs on March 1, when it was unclear whether Canada would be exempt at all. The firm wanted to know if the agency might be willing to take over management of its warehouse and find different cargo to fill it. 
Hamilton Chamber of Commerce President Keanin Loomis, a former Washington lawyer, is part of a new generation in the city who have never worked in a steel mill. But like much of the city, he has a personal connection to steel, a father-in-law retired from the Dofasco mill. 
If a tariff is imposed, Loomis expects imports to lower domestic steel prices, potentially driving some employers south of the border, where tariffs are expected to boost prices.
Loomis said high labor costs, environmental regulations and a looming carbon tax already make it difficult for the steel industry to compete. 
""This could be the thing that puts it over the edge,‚Äù he said. 
The city's United Steelworkers Local 1005 has only about 550 active members, down from more than 13,000 in its heyday in the 1970s. 
The local union represents workers at Stelco, but not Dofasco, which never organized. Since 2004 it has weathered the closure of Stelco's Hamilton mill, Stelco's two trips through bankruptcy protection, and two new owners. Members at another plant, Max Aicher North America, have been locked out for almost five years over proposed wage and benefit cuts. And union president Gary Howe sees choppy waters ahead. 
""With Trump being in there, it's probably never going to be over,"" he said.
The Canadian government has vowed to continue lobbying Washington until the threat of duties disappears. 
Pressed on Trump's decision to link the exemption to NAFTA, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Thursday that Canada considers the two issues to be totally separate.

""I think they should get some more backbone,"" Steve Kajganic, a retired veteran of the Stelco mill and a second-generation steelworker, said of the Canadian government. ""Stand up for our country, instead of selling it out.""

1323,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 03:31PM ET</span>",Boeing says Israel may opt for Chinooks over Sikorsky choppers,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Israeli military could decide within months to buy  Boeing Co .'s (N:BA) CH-47 Chinook transport helicopters following a strong endorsement by its ground forces, a senior Boeing official said on Sunday. 
The twin-rotor Chinooks would replace an aging fleet of Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters, which have been in operation since 1969, now manufactured by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT). Israel upgraded them at the turn of the century.
Israel does not publish the number of CH-53s in operation but defense industry sources said Israel was interested in buying 20 new helicopters.
The chief of Israel's ground forces recommended the Chinooks to the air force, which operates all of the country's military aircraft, Boeing Israel President David Ivry told Reuters.
""It's a matter of months. I can't say when exactly, as it is also a question of money ‚Äì how this matter fits into the IDF's (Israeli Defence Forces) multi-year budget,"" said Ivry, a former Israeli air force chief. 
The Israeli military and Defence Ministry had no immediate comment. 
Israeli media has reported that Israel was wary of the high price tag for the helicopter's latest variant, the CH-53K, and last week it quoted an unnamed senior military officer as expressing a preference for the Chinook.
The German Defence Ministry has said it will also choose between the Chinook and the CH-53K in its own competition to buy 45-60 heavy-lift aircraft to replace its aging fleet of CH-53G helicopters. ¬†It held an information day for industry last month and plans to issue a formal request for proposals later this year.
Ivry said the prospective Israeli and German deals had no impact on one another. 

""There is no mutual effect as each side is acting on the basis of its own needs,‚Äù he said.

1324,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 03:29PM ET</span>",Deutsche Bank to pay staff 2 billion euros in bonuses for 2017,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) -  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said on Sunday its 2017 bonus pool would be above 2 billion euros ($2.46 billion), as the loss-making bank seeks to retain staff during a major overhaul.
But the bank's top managers are foregoing their annual bonuses for 2017 after coming under fire for awarding big incentive payouts even though Germany's largest bank lost money last year.
""Variable compensation for the whole bank will be somewhat over 2 billion euros,"" Deutsche board member Karl von Rohr told news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA). 
The sacrificing of bonuses for the management board ""isn't because we are of the opinion that we did a bad job,"" von Rohr was quoted by DPA as saying. ""Rather, we considered it for the best that the board takes responsibility.""
A spokeswoman for Deutsche confirmed the information.
A bonus pool of just over 2 billion euros is significantly higher than the 546 million euros paid in 2016 but below the 2.4 billion euros awarded the year before. The bank sharply curtailed bonus payments for 2016 following speculation that it would need a state bailout to stay afloat.
Deutsche Bank came under fire in January over reports it planned to pay more than 1 billion euros in bonuses despite being pushed to its third consecutive annual loss due to the one-off impact of a U.S. tax reform.
With Deutsche still struggling to return to the black under the stewardship of Chief Executive John Cryan, the generous pay awards irked many in Germany as perceptions grow that wealth is increasingly being concentrated in the hands of the super-rich.
At the same time, Deutsche Bank is slashing its headcount, having reaffirmed plans to cut 9,000 jobs from 2015 levels, around one in 10 staff globally, with 4,000 expected to go in Germany.
In justifying his bonus plans, Cryan said last month Deutsche was making a ""one-off investment"" to retain staff and that bonuses for 2018 would be closely linked to performance.

The bank will detail executive compensation when it publishes its annual report next Friday.

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2018 02:33PM ET</span>","RWE, E.ON reshape German power sector in Innogy asset swap deal","By Christoph Steitz and Tom K√§ckenhoff
ESSEN/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Germany's top utilities on Sunday announced plans to break up Innogy (DE:IGY), whose assets will be divided among parent RWE (DE:RWED) and rival E.ON (DE:EONGN) in the sector's biggest overhaul since a landmark move to exit nuclear power.
The deal, which includes E.ON making a 5.2 billion euro ($6.4 billion) takeover offer to Innogy's minority shareholders, spells the end of the network, renewables and retail energy group, carved out from RWE two years ago, as a standalone unit.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to abandon nuclear power after Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011 has forced the sector to radically restructure in order to survive and already caused major plant shutdowns and billions of euros of losses.
Peter Altmaier, the next economy minister and a close ally of Merkel, said the deal was a consequence of that shift, known as the ""Energiewende"" in German. The companies had to adapt, he told the Rheinische Post newspaper.
Through the deal, which includes a share issue and asset swaps, E.ON will acquire Innogy's prized regulated energy networks and customer operations, while RWE will take on the renewables businesses of both E.ON and Innogy.
That would position RWE, which relies heavily on coal and gas-fired power plants, as a champion of the shift away from fossil fuels towards a more sustainable mix of energy sources. RWE kept 76.8 percent of Innogy after the 2016 carve-out.
ADVANTAGEOUS STEP
A source involved in the deal said it would be slightly more beneficial to E.ON, which would become a bigger regulated business by adding more networks, while RWE would end up owning interests in the riskier and more competitive renewables sector.
The source said that E.ON had been in a better bargaining position after RWE shopped Innogy to other European rivals, including France's Engie (PA:ENGIE), Italy's  Enel  (MI:ENEI) and Spain's  Iberdrola  (MC:IBE), without striking a deal.
""This looks like an advantageous step for E.ON at first glance,"" said Thomas Deser, fund manager at Union Investment, which holds shares in E.ON, RWE and Innogy.
""Through the renewable pipeline, RWE, too, should be able to offset its dwindling nuclear and lignite business as well as attract partners for the expansion of its wind business.""
The all-German transaction comes less than two years after E.ON and RWE both split up their businesses to separate legacy fossil fuel power plants from more promising networks and renewable assets.
E.ON in January agreed to sell a remaining 46.65 percent stake in its power plant and trading unit Uniper (DE:UN01), which it spun off in 2016, to Finland's  Fortum  (HE:FORTUM), a deal expected to close later this year.
The RWE-E.ON swap will also hand RWE - Germany's biggest electricity producer - a 16.67 percent stake in E.ON by way of a 20 percent capital increase. RWE will pay another 1.5 billion euros to E.ON to close a valuation gap that results from the complex structure of the asset swaps.
The transactions, which still require approval from the company's boards, face scrutiny by European Union regulators as well as from Germany's Federal Cartel Office, which did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
The European Commission declined to comment.
Innogy has been in turmoil since Chief Executive Peter Terium resigned in December in the wake of a profit warning and Chief Financial Officer Bernhard Guenther fell victim to a recent acid attack.
M&A TARGET
Innogy has been the target of persistent takeover talk, with sources saying recently that RWE had talked to Engie and Italy's Enel about a possible asset-swap deal. Other firms linked to Innogy included Iberdrola and Australian bank Macquarie (AX:MQG), an acquisitive infrastructure investor.
Innogy reports its annual results on Monday, while RWE does so on Tuesday and E.ON on Wednesday. The supervisory boards of both RWE and E.ON were due to meet on Sunday to review the deal, according to people familiar with the matter.
RWE's municipal shareholders, VkA, which jointly hold about 23 percent in the group, were caught off-guard by the announcement and said the plans would have to be thoroughly examined.
If approved, the deal could result in synergies of about 500 million euros, analysts at Bernstein estimate, pointing to double-staffing on the customer support side.
Labour sources welcomed the plans, saying that each company individually was unable to fund the networks, renewables and customer business in an adequate ways, but added talks about job protection would be a key demand.
Under the proposed transaction, E.ON would make a voluntary cash offer to buy RWE's Innogy stake valued at 40.00 euros per share, E.ON said in a filing issued early on Sunday. Innogy shares closed at 34.53 euros on Friday.
This price includes an offer of 36.76 euros per share plus assumed dividends of Innogy for the fiscal years 2017 and 2018 in the total aggregate amount of 3.24 euros per share, E.ON said. RWE will not participate in the offer.
E.ON also agreed to transfer most of its renewables business to RWE, including minority interests currently held by E.ON's subsidiary PreussenElektra in the RWE-operated nuclear power plants Emsland and Gundremmingen.

RWE in turn, will receive Innogy's renewables and gas storage business as well as Innogy's stake in Austrian energy supplier Kelag [KELAG.UL], E.ON said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors pulled $9.8 billion from stocks during the latest week, Lipper data showed on Thursday, halting the investments' budding momentum after February's selloff.
The withdrawals, recorded during the seven days through March 7, came as U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to impose import tariffs on steel and aluminum. The expected tariffs were seen raising the likelihood of a trade war that could stunt growth and stoke inflation.
Before the trade measures, U.S.-based equity funds had taken in cash for two straight weeks, following an early-February selloff also tied to inflation fears.
Following that 10 percent slide in the S&P 500 index, these equity funds posted record withdrawals of $23.9 billion, Lipper said.
""Trump and the tariffs create more uncertainty,"" said Pat Keon, senior research analyst for Thomson Reuters' Lipper research unit. ""We went through a mess of geopolitical tensions last year, and the markets just kept going up and up and up. They seemed impervious to it. This year, not so much.""
Real estate sector funds, seen as particularly vulnerable if inflation forces the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates aggressively, were hit by $577 million in withdrawals, the most since June 2017.
Bonds did not fare better, with taxable bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) overall recording $898 million of withdrawals during the week, according to Lipper. Low-risk money market funds took in $12.7 billion. Inflation erodes the value of a bond's typically fixed payout.
Meanwhile, cracks are showing in demand for some funds that have been popular with investors.
U.S.-based funds that invest in stock markets abroad, for instance, have been a popular bet, drawing $176 billion in new cash in 2017.
Yet during the most recent week, European-focused funds posted their largest withdrawals since December 2017 and Japanese-oriented funds recorded the most outflows since July 2017, with a combined $691 million pulled from both.
Corporate investment-grade bond funds, which reeled in $227 billion in 2017, posted $740 million in withdrawals during the latest week, the data showed. High-yield bond funds marked their eighth week of outflows, with $525 million drained out of them.

1330,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2018 04:41PM ET</span>",Britain funds export of CSeries jets in aftermath of trade row,"By Tim Hepher
(Reuters) - Britain has thrown financial support for the first time behind exports of Bombardier (TO:BBDb) CSeries jets part-built by Northern Ireland workers caught up in a recent trade row.
Export credit agency UK Export Finance said the financing for jets being delivered to Korean Air (KS:003490) would support jobs in Belfast, where the Canadian planemaker operates a state-of-the-art wings plant.
The move comes weeks after Bombardier won a shock reprieve from severe U.S. import duties on the 110-130-seat CSeries when a U.S. tribunal ruled Boeing (NYSE:BA) had failed to prove it had been harmed by low prices of CSeries sold to Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL). 
The Boeing-Bombardier dispute raised questions over jobs at Northern Ireland's largest industrial plant and drew warnings to Boeing over its UK ties from Prime Minister Theresa May, who depends on a Northern Ireland party for her majority.
Although Bombardier receives some UK development funding, UKEF had long resisted Canadian requests to finance CSeries exports that partly compete with those of Airbus (PA:AIR), the European plane giant which employs 12,000 people in the UK.
The decision to provide support reflects a power shift in the aerospace industry after Airbus agreed to buy a majority of the struggling CSeries last year, and is viewed by some experts as a reminder of ongoing UK interest in the CSeries' future.
""It is a small amount of money but a signal to Boeing,"" a European trade source said, asking not to be identified.
For its part, Boeing has signaled it would sue Bombardier again if provoked to do by what it regards as unfair pricing of CSeries jets. But there are signs it is trying to defuse the row as it highlights investments in Canada and Britain. 
Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters last week Boeing was still examining whether to appeal the International Trade Commission decision to overturn CSeries duties.
APPEAL DEADLINE
However, trade analysts say an appeal looks increasingly unlikely, ahead of a March 12 deadline, as Boeing seeks to smooth over a row which soured relations with Canada and Britain and resulted in the loss of a Boeing fighter sale to Canada.
""We are very mindful of the relationships that we have in Canada and ... we do about $4 billion of supply chain work in Canada every year,"" Muilenburg told Reuters.
""But we also want to make sure that we continue to set a standard for a fair playing field and that we all play by the same rules, and that will be our consistent theme."" 
Other potential obstacles to UK CSeries aid were lifted when UKEF eased a two-year ban on Airbus funding, resulting from misleading bids that triggered an Anglo-French corruption probe.
Airbus said last month it had reached agreement allowing the funding to resume on a case-by-case basis. 
Korean Air took delivery of its first CSeries in December, becoming the first Asian operator. Its order for 10 jets, with options for at least another 10, suggests the main beneficiary of UKEF support will be Airbus rather than Bombardier. The Airbus CSeries tie-up is expected to be approved in a matter of months.

Last July, Boeing itself became an indirect recipient of UK export support when UKEF said it was backing two Boeing 787s to Poland's LOT Airlines. However, the aid is tied mainly to Rolls-Royce (L:RR) engines rather than the airframes.

The deals include a contract for France's  Safran  (PA:SAF) to supply airline Spice Jet (BO:SPJT) with engines, water system modernization by Suez (PA:SEVI) in the southern city of Davangere and a contract between industrial gas company  Air Liquide  (PA:AIRP) and Sterlite.
Macron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ‚Äì addressing a news conference in New Delhi ‚Äì also committed to strengthening their partnership on defense and security.
""Whether it's the environment, naval security and resources, or freedom of navigation and overflight, we are committed to making our partnership stronger on all these fronts,"" Modi said. ""We consider France one of our most reliable defense allies.""
He also hailed France's commitment to making defense and security equipment in India and contributing to Modi's flagship ""Make in India"" plan to boost local manufacturing.
Macron said the countries had decided to do more together to fight terrorism and put together a strategy to share intelligence.
""Our navies will be able to call our respective military bases ... we will also have our space agencies conducting some joint monitoring of the maritime area,"" Macron said.
""The Pacific or the Indian Ocean cannot be places for hegemonic powers.""
Macron's office said some 200 million euros of investment would be made India. It did not provide a breakdown of the value or details of the business contracts.
In a statement later on Saturday, Indian carrier Spice Jet disclosed details of the engine deal - it will spend $12.5 billion to buy engines from CFM International, the engine maker co-owned by  General Electric  (N:GE) and France's Safran, and have them serviced.
As part of the deal, Spice Jet will buy LEAP-1B engines for its 155 Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft as well as spare engines. CFM will provide maintenance for all LEAP-1B engines that power SpiceJet's 737 MAX planes for 10 years, the statement added.
A so-called ""Industrial Way Forward Agreement"" was signed between French utility EDF (PA:EDF) and India's NPCIL for the construction of six nuclear reactors at Jaitapur.
Negotiations over the construction of next-generation nuclear reactors in India have been dragging on for years.

It was not immediately clear whether the individual contracts were firm orders or letters of intent.

The prediction follows a 30.5 percent plunge in Chinese steel exports last year to 75.43 million tonnes, as strong domestic prices and high profits at home led to a drop in shipments abroad.
The supply and demand trends are now more in line following the supply-side reforms ""while most of the downstream sectors have shown signs of recovery"", Li Lizhang told Reuters on the sidelines of China's annual parliament session on Saturday.
Demand from property, infrastructure, manufacturing and shipbuilding sectors will increase, he said, while steel supply would also see small pick-up this year compared to 2017.
China, the world's top steel maker, produced 831.73 million tonnes of crude steel last year. It aims to eliminate around 30 million tonnes of excess capacity as part of Beijing's steadfast effort to curb air pollution.
Cities across the country are carrying out stringent measures to lower fine particulate matter (PM2.5) readings. The steelmaking hub of Tangshan in Hebei province said it will extend production restrictions for another eight months after current curbs expire next week.
Li said production curbs would not be limited to the smog-prone region of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei: ""Other regions will also see restrictions if pollution levels exceed the limits.""
Despite this, steel prices would not see a big fluctuation, he said, as steel mills have already prepared for ""the new normal"".
Fujian Sangang, the biggest producer in southeastern China, has a total capacity of 11 million tonnes. It produced 11.19 million tonnes of steel products last year, and plans to produce 10.8 million tonnes in 2018.

Cryan was quoted by the Zeit weekly as saying the 12-member executive board would not get bonuses for 2017, but variable compensation would be paid to other staff as planned.
At a Zeit event at the South by Southwest tech conference in the United States, Cryan said the bonus pool would be ""significantly higher"" than the 546 million euros ($672 million) paid in 2016 but below the 2.4 billion euros awarded the year before. 
Deutsche Bank came under fire in January over reports it planned to pay more than 1 billion euros in bonuses despite being pushed to its third consecutive annual loss due to the one-off impact of a U.S. tax reform.
With Deutsche still struggling to return to the black under the stewardship of the 57-year-old Briton, the generous pay awards irked many in Germany as perceptions grow that wealth is increasingly being concentrated in the hands of the super-rich.
At the same time, Deutsche Bank is slashing its headcount, having reaffirmed plans to cut 9,000 jobs from 2015 levels, around one in 10 staff globally, with 4,000 expected to go in Germany.
A spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank confirmed that the Zeit report was accurate. The bank will detail executive compensation when it publishes its annual report next Friday.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>","U.S. Justice Department, AT&T spar over merger in final pre-trial documents","By Diane Bartz and David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) on Friday presented starkly different futures for online video if the wireless and pay-TV giant is allowed to buy  Time Warner  Inc (NYSE:TWX), as they laid out their cases for a blockbuster antitrust trial.
The judge's decision is crucial to the future of both companies and will likely determine how aggressive Republican-controlled antitrust regulators will be in coming years. U.S. President Donald Trump opposes the deal, and critics want to know if Trump's antipathy for Time Warner's CNN news network influenced regulators. 
In their final briefs before the trial opens on March 19, the two sides disagreed on whether the $85 billion deal would harm rivals in pay television or online video and sparred over whether consumers would pay more because of the planned merger.
The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in November to stop AT&T, which owns DirecTV and other products with 25 million subscribers, from buying movie and TV show maker Time Warner, which owns HBO and CNN, among many other channels.
It argued the deal would mean higher prices for rival cable and online video distributors and for consumers.
Investors and company executives had been expecting more leeway in mergers with a Republican administration that vowed to reduce government regulation. The outcome of the case could affect other pending vertical mergers, in which different parts of a supply chain, rather than rivals in the same business, join together. Health insurer  Cigna Corp  (NYSE:CI) wants to buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) wants to acquire health insurer  Aetna Inc  (NYSE:AET).
""If the Justice Department loses to AT&T in court this will substantially raise the barriers to the Justice Department bringing another vertical challenge such as with respect to CVS/Aetna or Cigna/Express Scripts,"" said Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department now in private practice.
GOVERNMENT SAYS CONSUMERS WILL PAY MORE; AT&T SAYS NO
The Justice Department used economic modeling to show that consumers will pay their pay TV provider more for Turner Broadcasting content, if U.S. District Judge Richard Leon allows the deal.
""The acquisition would give AT&T a new tool to slow down the development and growth of disruptive online competitors in the future,"" the department added in its brief. ""AT&T can profess it wants to lead the charge to the future, but its internal documents reveal a less attractive reality.""
For its part, AT&T said the merger would result in ""more than $2.5 billion in annual synergies by 2020 and more than $25 billion in total synergies on a net present value basis.""
AT&T and Time Warner said prices would not rise because the company would compete with newer media companies like  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) , Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc , Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX).
""Nothing will be withheld from competitors; consumer prices will not go up,"" the companies said, arguing the lawsuit itself was holding back consumer access to better products.

On Thursday, 11 former Justice Department officials ranging from Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney, and John Dean, President Richard Nixon's lawyer during the Watergate scandal, urged Judge Leon to reconsider his refusal to allow AT&T to demand communications between the White House and Justice Department about the merger probe.

1336,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 10:50PM ET</span>",China steps up scrutiny of bank shareholders,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's banking regulator has ordered shareholders that have acquired more than five percent stakes in commercial banks through the use of financial products like insurance and asset management schemes to reduce their holdings within a year.
The regulation, dated Feb. 2 but made public late on Friday, is the latest in a series of measures to control risk and excessive leverage in the financial system, with everything from doggy lending practices to shadow banking under the microscope.
The regulator also said in a separate online statement that it ""strictly forbids shareholders from imposing inappropriate control over banks and seeking illegitimate interests"". 
The China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) will target small and mid-tier banks' shareholding structures and conduct on-site checks this year, it said. 
The rules will force conglomerates like Anbang Insurance Group Co, which has built up stakes in commercial lenders through funds raised from short-term, high-yielding universal life insurance products, to trim their holdings.
As of Sept. 30, Anbang Insurance Group held a 15.54 percent stake in  China Minsheng Banking  Corp (SS:600016) (HK:1988) as a result of a direct stake held by Anbang Life and through two separate financial products, company filings show.
The Beijing-based insurer also held a greater than 13 percent interest in China  Merchants Bank  Co (SS:600036) (HK:3968) through its property and casualty insurance unit during the same period.
The CBRC said it would investigate whether commercial banks' shareholders were using their own, legally obtained funds for investment and whether they were holding stakes for other parties.
Any other existing stake purchase of more than five percent by investors and their related parties must seek approval by the CBRC within six months.
The new rules follow guidelines released in January that required major shareholders to disclose their ownership structures up to the ultimate beneficial holder. 

The CBRC is drafting another set of new rules on shareholding custodianship to further increase transparency and standardize the management of banks' shareholding structures, it added.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 08:10PM ET</span>","Best Buy CEO says turnaround done, room to compete with Amazon","By Nandita Bose
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Best Buy  Co Inc (N:BBY) has completed a five-year turnaround and is ready to compete with market leader Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to prove U.S. retail is not a ""winner takes all"" situation, Chief Executive Hubert Joly told Reuters on Friday.
Brick-and-mortar retailers like Best Buy have closed stores and some have gone out of business over the past few years in the face of online competition and the decline of American malls.
The largest U.S. consumer electronics retailer is attracting customers again, Joly said in an interview.
""We have turned around the business, it's about where we go from here,"" he said. ""We have not only survived but thrived and I don‚Äôt believe this is a winner-takes-all market.""
For the last five years the Richfield, Minnesota-based retailer has invested in price-matching, faster delivery, improving the search function on its website and better customer service to draw in shoppers to its stores and website. In the latest holiday quarter, Best Buy posted its best sales in a decade, boosted by a rebounding economy and stronger consumer confidence, and projected sales above Wall Street estimates. 
The retailer's share price is up 271 percent over the past five years, closing at $73.82 on Friday. The S&P is up about 75 percent in that time.
Best Buy's appliance and home theater business has benefited from the bankruptcy of competitors RadioShack and HH Gregg Inc and tumbling sales at Sears Holdings Corp (O:SHLD), Joly said. 
Best Buy has about 15 percent of the U.S. consumer electronics market. Along with rival Amazon, the two retailers have about 25 percent market share, leaving room to grow, the executive said.
The company is betting on new services under its In-Home Advisor and Total Tech Support programs, which offer tech help to shoppers in an effort to boost sales. It is also opening warehouses near urban markets to speed online delivery. 

Investments in employee pay and training and other initiatives have resulted in a drop in worker turnover to about 30 percent from 50 percent to 55 percent about three to five years ago. Store managers are also staying on the job much longer, he said.

(Reuters) - A U.S. national security panel has ordered Singapore-based chipmaker Broadcom (O:AVGO) to provide it with five business days' notice before taking any action toward redomiciling to the United States, a regulatory filing this week revealed.
The previously undisclosed requirement shows that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which reviews foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies for potential national security risks, is aware that its jurisdiction could be contested if Broadcom redomiciles to the United States.
The panel on Sunday ordered San Diego-based  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM) to postpone its shareholder meeting by 30 days so it could investigate Broadcom's $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm.
Lawyers that specialize in advising companies on CFIUS matters have been debating this week whether Broadcom's bid would be subject to a CFIUS review once it redomiciles.
""It is not entirely clear how establishing a U.S. domicile would affect CFIUS' view of its jurisdiction over the proposed transaction,"" Kirkland & Ellis LLP, a U.S. law firm not involved in the matter, wrote in a note to clients on Friday.
""CFIUS' determination as to whether an entity is considered 'foreign' is nuanced and not prescriptive, and encompasses considerations that include a facts and circumstances assessment of ownership and formal and informal mechanisms of control,"" the Kirkland lawyers wrote.
Broadcom said on Friday it expected to complete its move to the United States by May 6. It disclosed it had petitioned a Singapore court on March 9 to order the convening of a special shareholder meeting to approve the redomiciliation. This meeting will be held on March 23, the company said. The Singapore Court will then have to greenlight the redomiciliation.
""We are aware of the terms in the (CFIUS) order and are in full compliance,"" a Broadcom spokeswoman said by email when asked whether the company had given CFIUS the required five-day notice on action to redomicile.
CFIUS' instructions to Broadcom were disclosed by Qualcomm in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that contained CFIUS' interim order to both companies. Qualcomm and a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, declined to comment.
CFIUS in its order on Sunday also instructed Qualcomm not to take any action that could lead to a deal with Broadcom during the panel's review, Qualcomm's regulatory filing showed. Broadcom has nominated six directors for election to Qualcomm's 11-member board as a way to force negotiations between the two companies.
CFIUS, an inter-agency panel led by the U.S. Treasury, rarely reviews mergers before a deal has been clinched. The review of Broadcom's bid illustrates the U.S. government's expanding focus on the competitiveness of the national semiconductor industry as China advances.
The U.S. government is concerned that Chinese companies, including the big network equipment and mobile phone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], would take advantage of any openings to take the lead in the next generation mobile phone networks known as 5G. 

""As a U.S. corporation, our future acquisitions in the United States would not be subject to certain regulatory processes required for acquisitions by foreign corporations,"" Broadcom said in a regulatory filing on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two former executives at Transmar Commodity Group Ltd pleaded guilty on Friday to defrauding banks to win a $400 million credit line for the now bankrupt New Jersey-based cocoa trading company.
Peter G. Johnson, who was Transmar's chief executive, and his son Peter B. Johnson, who oversaw Transmar's Euromar Commodities affiliate, both pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and wire fraud before U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan, according to the office of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman.
""Today our client accepted responsibility for his role in the issues at Transmar,"" said Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Peter B. Johnson. ""He remains committed to further explaining this tragic story.""
A lawyer for the elder Johnson could not immediately be reached for comment.
Peter G. Johnson, 69, of Harding Township, New Jersey, and Peter B. Johnson, 38, of Morristown, were arrested at their homes in August 2017. A third Transmar executive, former finance vice president Thomas Reich, was also charged and has pleaded not guilty. [nL1N1KU1CM]

Prosecutors have accused the three executives of ""lying repeatedly"" from 2014 to December 2016 by giving banks false ""borrowing base"" reports that inflated the amount of collateral Transmar had to support its borrowings.
Transmar owed the banks roughly $360 million at the time of the bankruptcy, prosecutors said.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 05:10PM ET</span>",Derivatives experts wary about next U.S. stock volatility shock,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
BONITA SPRINGS, Fla. (Reuters) - Investors should be protecting against secondary shocks as the initial surprise of a February plunge in U.S. equity markets wears off, analysts warned on Friday. 
The recent bout of volatility rocked a market that had been unusually calm by historical standards, leaving investors used to a steady march higher in stock prices wondering how to best position themselves. 
""Is this it? Or is this symptomatic of something much, much larger?,"" asked Dean Curnutt, chief executive of Macro Risk Advisors, in a keynote speech at the Cboe Risk Management conference.
""I would argue that it is an open question, but it's something we should be really thinking about,"" he said.
A 4 percent drop in the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX) on Feb. 5 triggered the largest-ever spike in the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), a barometer of expected near-term volatility for U.S. stocks known as Wall Street's ""fear gauge.""
The shock upended the index from record lows that had spawned massive interest in so-called short volatility trades, causing several popular VIX-linked short-volatility exchange traded products to implode.
Investors are now looking for ways to transition to a more normal level of daily price swings or even a period of above-average volatility. 
One approach would be through longer maturity derivative contracts, such as VIX futures and call options, that would offer protection against rising volatility, Nitin Saksena, head of U.S. equity derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), told Reuters.
Recent stock market ructions have made hedging with S&P 500 options expensive, so investors could also look at owning proxy hedges like protective options contracts on the Euro Stoxx 50, FTSE and Russell 2000 Index, he said.
Single-stock options also offer an alternative for investors looking to hedge equity-related portfolios, said Kambiz Kazemi, partner at Canadian investment management firm La Financi√®re Constance.
""The markets have entered a new regime and will likely experience more bouts of volatility and be tested in the medium term,"" Kazemi told Reuters, pointing to political uncertainty and the prospect of higher U.S. interest rates.
Large and opaque risks from trend-following strategies, risk-parity portfolios and volatility-targeting funds, all plays on low volatility, could still linger in the market. 
There is little consensus among analysts on exactly how much money is devoted to these types of strategies, but many agree it is substantial.
Some $1.5 trillion had been involved in strategies linked to short volatility, according to a November paper by Vineer Bhansali, chief investment officer at California-based investment adviser LongTail Alpha. Kazemi is not particularly bearish right now, he told Reuters, but there may be lingering risk from short volatility positioning and product design that is not fully appreciated in the market. To be sure, these strategies have diverse time horizons and exposures and may not unwind at the same time, making a repeat of the recent short volatility implosion unlikely, analysts said.  But depending on how the strategies react, there is a possibility that ""it will not be a pretty unwind,"" Kazemi said.

FARRELL, Penn. (Reuters) - Mick Lang has been a steelworker for nearly 40 years and voted for businessman Donald Trump in the hopes he would bring about a renaissance for the long-suffering U.S. steel industry. Now he worries President Trump's tariffs on imports of the metal will cost him his job.
""This is not what I voted for. I voted for Trump because I thought he'd straighten things out, not do something like this,"" said Lang, 59, a third-generation steelworker, whose son also works at the same steel mill in Farrell in western Pennsylvania's Mercer County.
The county voted for then-Republican candidate Trump by more than 24 points in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Some Republican strategists said Trump's tariffs appeared partly to be timed to sway voters in Pennsylvania steel country, where a special election is being held for a U.S. House of Representatives seat next Tuesday. 
Trump is scheduled to visit Moon Township about 60 miles southwest of Farrell on Saturday to support the Republican candidate and he is expected to be warmly received in an area he also won handily in 2016. U.S. steel companies such as U.S. Steel Corp (N:X) and AK Steel Holding Corp (N:AKS) - seen as winners thanks to the president's actions - have lauded Trump's tariff on imported steel. 
U.S. Steel said it would restart one of two idled blast furnaces at an Illinois steel plant, creating up to 500 jobs.
America is the world's largest steel importer, buying about 35 million tons in 2017. GRAPHIC: http://tmsnrt.rs/2oPeo1z
But Lang is one of around 780 workers at the Novolipetsk Steel PAO (NLMK) (MM:NLMK) mill, NLMK's U.S. subsidiary which imports around 2 million tons of steel slabs annually from its Russian parent company. The slabs that the mill rolls into sheets for customers including  Caterpillar  Inc (N:CAT), Deere & Co (N:DE) Harley Davidson Inc (N:HOG) and  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD), are almost impossible to acquire from U.S. steel producers.
Bob Miller, Chief Executive Officer of NLMK's U.S. unit, said if his company's customers refuse to accept a 25 percent price hike as a result of the tariffs, nearly 1,200 workers could eventually lose their jobs - and the ones in Farrell would be the first to go when supplies of imported slabs run out.
The U.S. steel industry employed about 147,000 people in 2015, according to the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic analysis. Manufacturers that need steel employ about 6.5 million people each year and the construction industry 6.3 million. GRAPHIC: http://tmsnrt.rs/2Fc94hU

Miller said tariffs will also force NLMK to shelve planned $600 million investments in plants in Pennsylvania and Indiana, around $400 million of which was earmarked for upgrading antiquated equipment at its Farrell plant. 
Trump has stood by the tariffs, despite resistance from his fellow Republicans and other countries, which have vowed to respond with levies of their own. On Thursday, Trump pressed ahead with the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum.
Some steel executives such as Miller say this is the ultimate irony: by acting ostensibly to protect U.S. steel jobs with sweeping tariffs, Trump will also kill off some steel jobs.
""The workers here in Farrell are on the front line,"" Miller said. ""This policy is picking winners and losers and unfortunately, we are the losers.""
The tariffs are good for steel producers that melt and produce their own steel. But for those like NLMK, which is reliant on imported raw materials, they could prove catastrophic.
The mill is the largest employer in Farrell and accounts for more than one fifth of the town's tax base. Mercer County has a poverty rate that is nearly double the national average.
The area was America's steel heartland, with mills dotting the landscape until the industry's decline began in the 1970s because of an increase in global competition. The mill owned by NLMK has existed since the beginning of the 20th century, but experienced two lengthy shutdowns and mass layoffs in the 1990s.
Its blast furnace was sold for scrap and instead of producing steel, its current crop of workers heat 25-ton imported steel slabs to a glowing-orange temperature of 2,400 degrees fahrenheit (1,316 Celsius) before rolling them down in some cases to as thick as a few sheets of paper.
Amid blasts of steam, intense heat, dirt and noise, the mill's 600 union-represented workers earn up to $27 per hour, a solid middle-class wage.
Terry Day, local president for the United Steelworkers union, said the 1990s shutdowns convulsed the community and resulted in a spate of suicides and divorces.
""This time it will be much worse,"" said Day, 53, who experienced both shutdowns. ""Back then there were other jobs to go to, but now there's nothing else here."" 
""It would be devastating.""
Steel customers ranging from automakers General Motors Co (N:GM) - which makes its Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio, around 20 miles west of Farrell - and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) to soup maker  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB) and brewer  Molson Coors  Brewing Co (N:TAP) are expected to lose, as tariffs will allow domestic steel producers to raise prices.
But likely job losses within the steel industry run counter to Trump's professed aims of bringing back manufacturing jobs. 
""There is a substantial number of people in the steel industry that could lose their jobs as a result of tariffs,"" said metal analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research.
Farrell can ill afford to lose its NLMK steel jobs.
The town's population of under 5,000 is less than a third of what it was in 1920. As of June 2017, there were around 11,000 steel jobs in Pennsylvania, 2 percent of the state's 546,000 manufacturing jobs. Mercer County had 5.5 percent unemployment in December - above the state rate of 4.8 percent and the national rate of 4.1 percent. 
The Farrell mill was originally owned by a U.S. firm that went bankrupt in 1992 and was subsequently owned by British and Swiss companies before the Russians bought in back in 2006. Since then, NLMK has invested around $1 billion in its U.S. operations, U.S. CEO Miller said.
Miller is working to lobby the Trump administration to follow the precedent of former Republican President George W. Bush's administration, which allowed quotas for slab steel in 2002 rather than applying tariffs as it did for products that were domestically produced.
Those quotas allowed the Farrell plant to keep operating and Miller hopes the Trump administration will follow suit.

The mood in Farrell is grim and fearful. Truckers coming to pick up coils of rolled steel ask when the mill will go out of business and plant manager Bill Benson says workers keep asking him: ""What on earth is Trump thinking?""

1353,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 04:41PM ET</span>",Top 5 Things That Moved Markets This Past Week,"Investing.com ‚Äì Top 5 things that rocked U.S. markets this week.
1. Wage Growth: Lightening Doesn‚Äôt Strike Twice
Traders had to endure yet another week of wild swings in U.S. stock markets as jobs data, Trump‚Äôs tariffs and a surprise conciliatory gesture by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un helped U.S. indexes post a weekly win. 
U.S. stocks rounded off the week with sharp gains on Friday as the Dow closed 440 points higher after data showed the U.S. economy created 313,000 jobs in February. 
Unlike the previous jobs report in January, Friday‚Äôs jobs report didn‚Äôt spark investor panic as wages grew at a slower pace than estimated, denting the prospect of a faster pace of inflation. That in turn, kept a lid on expectations for a fourth rate hike in December. 
That came amid falling geopolitical tensions on the Korean peninsula as the White House confirmed that Trump has agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
A day earlier, meanwhile, President Donald Trump, as expected, pushed forward with plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports on Thursday, but exempted Canada and Mexico while leaving the door open for ‚Äúreal friends‚Äù of the U.S. to negotiate exemptions. 
2. WTI Crude Soared To Notch Unlikely Weekly Win
When crude prices settled more than 2% lower on Thursday for the second straight day, investors had little hope that oil prices would avert a second-straight weekly plunge were it not for a more than 3% rally on Friday. 
The rally on Friday was partly supported by data showing that the number of U.S. oil rigs fell for the first time in seven weeks, pointing to a potential slowdown in U.S. oil output.
While the lower rig count signalled a potential tightening in output, U.S. shale producers are expected to continue to ramp output, taking advance of oil prices above $60 a barrel.
The Energy Information Agency reported Wednesday that U.S. output jumped to a record high per day of nearly 10.4 million barrels last week, while crude stockpiles rose less than expected. 
On Friday U.S. crude futures rose $1.95 to settle at $64.91 a barrel.
3. Central Bankers Leave Their Mark on Euro, Yen
EUR/USD settled roughly unchanged for the week, after the European Central Bank (ECB), as expected, left interest rates unchanged and adopted a less hawkish stance in its monetary policy statement, dropping its pledge to increase bond purchases if the economic outlook deteriorates. 
ECB president Mario Draghi, however, tempered any notion that the ECB's decision to omit its easing bias from the statement marked the start of shift in policy, as he warned of potential headwinds for the EU economy in the form of subdued inflation, and a potential trade war with the U.S.
The Italian election Sunday, resulting in a hung parliament, had little impact on the euro as it was quick to rebound from any weakness. 
The yen ‚Äì which had served as the safe-haven proxy last week ‚Äì fell sharply against the dollar as fears of a global trade war subsided, while the Bank of Japan, spearheaded by governor Kuroda, left its ultra-accommodative monetary policy measures unchanged.
4. Gold Prices Averted Third Weekly Slump
Gold prices squeezed a win for the first time in the three weeks despite falling safe-haven demand as Trump‚Äôs tariffs were less controversial than many had feared, while geopolitical uncertainty eased after Trump accepted North Korean leader Kim Jong Un‚Äôs invite for a sit down. 
Some market participants, however, questioned the sincerity of Kim Jong Un‚Äôs conciliatory gesture as it was only a few months ago that the two nations exchanged a flurry of verbal threats. 
‚ÄúNorth Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,‚Äù Trump told journalists in August last year. ‚ÄúThey will be met with fire and the fury like the world has never seen.‚Äù
With a little less than two weeks until the Federal Reserve meets to decide whether to stick or twist on interest rates, traders remain surprisingly optimistic on the prospect of gold adding to this week‚Äôs gains. 
CFTC COT data showed money managers increased their long bets on gold in the week ended March 9. 
5. Bitcoin: How low can it go?
Bitcoin ended the week nursing heavy loss as fresh regulatory threats forced traders to cut their positions on cryptocurrencies. 
The SEC warned on Wednesday it would take a closer look at trading platforms operating as exchanges that failed to register with the regulator, leaving many questioning whether this was the start of a wider crackdown. 
More technically-minded market participants, however, were quick to point to technical reasons to explain bitcoin‚Äôs collapse as the popular digital currency failed to break above a ‚Äúkey level‚Äù close to $12,000. Bitcoin rose to high of $11,696 this week before retreated sharply. 
Frank Cappelleri, executive director, institutional equities at Nomura Instinet, warned that ‚Äúif bitcoin fails to garner demand at current levels then ‚Äúthe February lows [around $6,000] would in the cross-hairs.""
The prospect of a flood in demand looks unlikely, however, as the total cryptomarket cap fell to about $372 billion ‚Äì at the time of writing ‚Äì down nearly 20% from $457 billion last week, indicating that investors continue to slash their bullish bets on crypto bets, while new entrants remain reluctant to buy the dips."

1363,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 04:57PM ET</span>",Exclusive: GE explores divesting electrical engineering business - sources,"By Harry Brumpton and Greg Roumeliotis
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) is exploring a sale of the electrical engineering business which it acquired for $3.2 billion in 2011, as the U.S. industrial conglomerate continues to shed unwanted assets, according to four people familiar with the matter. 
John Flannery, who took over as GE's chief executive last summer, indicated to analysts and investors for the first time earlier this year that he was open to breaking up the company, and said that a spinoff of any of its units, which include power, healthcare and aviation, was possible.
GE acquired Converteam, an electrical engineering company, in 2011 to boost its presence in that sector. At the time, energy was GE's most profitable business, accounting for a quarter of the company's revenue. Since then demand for its products have fallen sharply, and profit at the division plunged 45 percent last year.
Converteam, which in 2012 was rebranded GE Power Conversion, is losing money, and is expected to fetch less than what GE paid for it, the sources said this week. GE is reviewing ways to shed the unit before launching a sale process, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.
A GE spokeswoman declined to comment.
GE's power conversion business makes electrical motors and positioning systems for oil rigs, bulk transport ships and aircraft carriers, as well as power converters for solar farms, mines and mills. GE acquired Converteam from a private equity consortium that included  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Private Equity and LBO France.
GE's stock has lost half its value in the last 12 months, and Flannery is under pressure from investors, including activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP which sits on its board of directors, to turn the business around.
The divestiture would be the latest in a string of asset sales GE is exploring. Reuters reported in February that GE was considering divesting its industrial gas engine business, which includes the Jenbacher and Waukesha engines.
Since last year, GE has also been seeking to hive off other divisions, including its railway locomotives business, consumer lightbulbs manufacturing assets and healthcare information technology business.
GE views a spinoff of its railway locomotive unit as ore likely than a sale, given the tax hit from an outright sale, according to the sources.
Flannery said in October that GE would sell at least $20 billion in operations to shore up its financial performance.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Nasdaq blasted through a record high on Friday as traders looking to ride recent momentum piled into Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other high-performance technology names.
The rise came alongside a broad rally in the market. The S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose sharply - up 1.5 percent - as February's jobs report assuaged fears of inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes. The gains came nine years to the day since the bull market began.
Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon each rose more than 1 percent and hit or closely approached all-time highs, while the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index surged 1.8 percent to its own record.
Those stock moves helped push the Nasdaq Composite Index up 1.4 percent to 7,532 points, which is about a third of a percent higher than its previous all-time high on Jan 26.
The Nasdaq and the S&P 500, also up about 1.4 percent, were both helped by employment data that tempered fears of faster interest rate increases.
There was no major news specifically related to the tech sector driving its gains.
Netflix jumped 3.6 percent, also hitting a record high and bringing the video streaming service's gain in the past year to 65 percent.
""You look at tech and think, 'What is the catalyst that's going to bring it down?' I don't see one in the short term, and that makes me confident as a trader to go into those stocks that have been the leaders,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC. 
Technology stocks have been widely viewed in recent months as a ""crowded trade,"" a situation where most investors have the same opinion, increasing the potential for a volatile selloff if sentiment changes. 
For example, Bank of Montreal in January launched an exchange traded fund aiming to triple the return of 10 stocks, including the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon, Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
Large cap active fund managers recently trimmed their relative weight in technology stocks to 1.18 times the broader market, down from 1.23 last month, giving up to discretionary stocks its position as the most crowded sector, according to a recent report from Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). 

The Nasdaq is up 9 percent year to date, compared to a 3 percent increase in S&P 500, which has yet to recover from a February selloff sparked by fears of higher interest rates.

BONITA SPRINGS, Fla. (Reuters) - February's wild U.S. stock market ride brought a higher tempo and some must-hear presentations to the often staid discussions at the Cboe's Global Market Inc's major annual derivatives conference.
In the shadow of the February plunge in stock prices and their more than two-thirds recovery from the decline, focus was on the dramatic demise of some funds as well as strategies that bet against market turbulence.
One pair of presenters at the 11th hour ditched a presentation titled ""How to hedge when markets no longer fear risk"" in favor of one called, ""Trading volatility through the bubble and beyond.""
""It's injected a bit of excitement into the conference, at least to the extent you can get a bunch of old options hands excited,"" said Benn Eifert, founder and chief investment officer at QVR Advisors. 
There were others who had to dash to book a seat at the Cboe's (O:CBOE) Risk Management conference. 
""I had been following the short volatility trade for a long time, even though we trade equities and are long only,"" said Yuda Goodman, trader at Redwood Investments, LLC, located just outside of Boston.
""Then when everything happened in February, I was like, 'Whoa! I really need to register now because it affects the whole market,"" he said.
SHUDDER AND SHUTTER 
A 4-percent, one-day drop for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) on Feb. 5, led to the largest ever spike in the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), the most widely-followed measure of expected near-term swings for U.S. stocks. 
The shock rang the death knell for some popular 'short volatility' exchange traded products (ETPs), including the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term Exchange-Traded Note, and launched a flurry of questions about what transpired on Feb. 5.
The shuttering of LJM Partners Ltd, a Chicago-based fund manager, after near-total losses in last month's volatility shock, dominated conversations.
Attendees were delving into the reasons behind the collapse of these strategies and what could come next.
""The whole conference has been a post-mortem,"" said Anand Omprakash, director of equity and derivative strategy at  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP). 
Still, in the wake of the hit to the short volatility trade, conference organizers said registrations fell to 279 from 300 in 2017.
""If they got blown out, they are probably not going to show up here,"" said Matt Amberson, founder at Chicago-based volatility and options data firm ORATS. ""There's a bit of a survivorship bias here,"" he said on the conference sidelines.

But as our weekly review of world economy shows, officials from Frankfurt to Tokyo didn‚Äôt have to change monetary policy to move markets. The lesson is that investors are watching most central banks closely for any sign they‚Äôre twisting toward tighter monetary policy.
Holding Fire
The European Central Bank left policy unchanged, yet President Mario Draghi and colleagues dropped a pledge to increase quantitative easing if needed.
That‚Äôs a sign of increased confidence in the durability of the euro-area outlook, although Bloomberg reported the ECB‚Äôs staff is still assuming asset purchases totaling 30 billion euros in the fourth quarter. Bloomberg Economics sees more decisions coming in June.
Also leaving policy on hold was the Bank of Japan. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda still sought to clarify recent remarks by saying that while it may think about exiting stimulus in the 2019 fiscal year, that doesn‚Äôt mean it will actually do so. Economists don‚Äôt see any shift this year.
The Bank of Canada indicated it‚Äôs in no rush to aggressively hike rates amid trade tensions and Poland‚Äôs central bank extended the likely timing of a rate increase beyond this year after new economic projections. Malaysia and Turkey also held fire.
Meantime, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, one of the most dovish U.S. officials, suggested the pace of tightening may need to accelerate. People‚Äôs Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan said the world‚Äôs second-largest economy ‚Äúcan be bolder in opening up.‚Äù
Heavy Steel
Central bankers the world over were virtually united in signaling irritation with President Donald Trump‚Äôs decision to slap tariffs on aluminum and steel as our wrap of their comments shows.
Trump‚Äôs decision prompted the resignation of Gary Cohn as his top economic adviser, a move that tilts the internal White House policy debate in favor of hawks who want to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with the world.
In a potential sign of things to come, Bloomberg reported the U.S. is also considering clamping down on Chinese investments in the U.S. and slapping levies on a broad range of its imports to punish Beijing for its alleged theft of intellectual property.
The tensions run deeper than trade and highlight a growing battle over who secures the spoils of the global economy.
For more on the topic of trade wars, check out our QuickTake Q&A and also Bloomberg Economics‚Äô explanation of why a repeat of the 1930s is unlikely. One analysis reckons every 10 percent U.S. tariff on China would cut the rival nation‚Äôs output by 1 percent.
Jobs Blowout
On the brighter side, U.S. jobs figures out Friday blew past economists‚Äô expectations and signaled the nation‚Äôs labor market has room to run.
Nonfarm payrolls rose 313,000, the most since mid-2016 and well above the median projection for 205,000. The share of working-age Americans in the labor force rose by the most in almost eight years despite downward pressure from retiring baby boomers, indicating people were coming back to work from the sidelines. On top of that, wage gains cooled by more than expected from a pace that spurred financial turbulence last month.
The question for Fed policy makers now is whether a faster pace of interest-rate increases is warranted this year than the three they projected in December.
To Fed dove Neel Kashkari, the data support his view that the U.S. isn‚Äôt really at full employment yet. ‚ÄúWe were at maximum employment. We are now at maximumer employment,‚Äù the Minneapolis Fed president tweeted Friday.
Whither Wages
Still, subdued inflation despite robust global economic growth and falling unemployment continues to baffle policy makers.
Bloomberg reporters in Japan took a closer look at activity on the ground for clues as to why wages remained suppressed even after massive stimulus and the tightest labor market since the 1970s.
Take Toyota, whose retained earnings have risen 53 percent in the past five years, but it‚Äôs been cautious about pay raises. On the high street, there‚Äôs evidence why retail outlets are reluctant to pass on prices rises to customers for fear of scaring off customers.
With wage negotiations looming, economists expect only a 1 percent pay rise this year. This would be the biggest since 1997, but hardly enough.
Even with the slowdown in wages, the Fed sees room for hope as does Australia‚Äôs central bank.
Populism and China on the March
Italy‚Äôs troubled election result was a potent reminder of how fragile global politics has become.
The outcome leaves a struggling economy seeking direction and major reforms but little clarity on who can do that.
It also means uncertainty continues to dog the euro area economy which this year is set to be eclipsed by China.
China‚Äôs gross domestic product is forecast to reach about $13.2 trillion in 2018, beating the $12.8 trillion combined total of the 19 countries that use the euro, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China is even set to get a monthly jobs report.

Li revealed last month he had built up an almost 10 percent stake in Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler, hoping to access electric and self-driving car technology in a move which caught the German carmaker by surprise.
""How do we generate synergies with them going forward? That will depend on whether they have such a desire. If they do, we'll collaborate with them. If they don't, then we won't,"" Li was quoted as saying. 
""Collaboration is not the only issue and is not a precondition,"" Li told Bloomberg.
""Why do people think we shouldn't make an investment if there are no synergies? Why shouldn't we? Many people around the world have put money into Daimler. Why shouldn't we,"" Bloomberg quoted Li as saying.

The chairman's remarks come after executives at Daimler and Volvo Cars questioned the viability and industrial logic of a collaboration, and after Daimler moved to strengthen its partnership with China partner BAIC (HK:1958).

1380,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>","It's Market Deja Vu: Jobs Beat, Wages Miss, and Stocks Rally","(Bloomberg) -- It‚Äôs a familiar sequence: Payrolls beat estimates, wages miss, and stocks rally. Everyone can relax, the ‚ÄúGoldilocks‚Äù scenario is again alive and well in the U.S. economy.
The S&P 500 Index is cruising toward a 3 percent weekly advance, helped Friday by the same labor department data that last month sparked the worst equity meltdown in two years. This time round, though, the figures showed employers added the most workers since mid-2016 and wage gains cooled; and that‚Äôs adding up to a rosy outlook for stocks.
The inflation fears stoked by last month‚Äôs strong wage numbers may have been overdone, so the story goes. It‚Äôs breathed new life into 2017‚Äôs narrative of an economy that‚Äôs not too hot and not too cold, suggesting the Federal Reserve will have the leeway to increase interest rates at a pace that equity traders can stomach.
The report ‚Äúappears to have delivered the data that most observers would have wanted, with a strong overall set of data ‚Äòwalking back‚Äô last month‚Äôs spike in average hourly earnings,‚Äù said Michael Shaoul, chief executive officer of Marketfield Asset Management.
The U.S. added 313,000 jobs in February, labor department data showed Friday, beating the estimate of 205,000. Wage data came in low, though, with average hourly earnings only increasing 2.6 percent from a year earlier, compared with calls for 2.8 percent.
We‚Äôve been here before. Step back to Dec. 8, when payrolls data for November hit the wire. The U.S. economy hired 228,000 workers, more than forecast, and wages came in softer than expected. The S&P 500 gained 0.6 percent that Friday, pushing the week‚Äôs action into positive territory.
That‚Äôs a stark contrast with last month. Feb. 2 was ground zero for stocks, kicking off a series of declines that would eventually lead to the first 10 percent correction in two years. That jobs report showed wages jumped 2.9 percent from a year prior, higher than estimates, and investors and economists started to wonder if this was a long-awaited sign that inflation was becoming a threat.
‚ÄúThere was a growing fear the Fed was behind the curve when it came to its inflation outlook,‚Äù Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer of Penn Mutual Asset Management, said by phone. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs number seems to suggest that maybe the past two month‚Äôs wage gains have moderated some and will allow the Fed to tighten on their pace, not the market‚Äôs pace.‚Äù

1403,By Seeking Alpha,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 12:02PM ET</span>",WSJ: Goldman's Blankfein plans to step down as soon as end of the year,
1404,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 04:42PM ET</span>",Goldman CEO Blankfein prepares to exit as soon as year-end: WSJ,"By Catherine Ngai
(Reuters) - Lloyd Blankfein could step down as  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) chief executive as soon as the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, swiveling the focus to fierce competition between the two contenders to replace him.
Blankfein, 63, one of the longest-serving CEOs on Wall Street, has led what is viewed as the most powerful U.S. investment bank for nearly 12 years. He has outlasted calls for his departure in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and stayed in the job even as he battled cancer.
Blankfein appeared to distance himself from the Journal's report on Friday afternoon.
""It's the @WSJ's announcement...not mine. I feel like Huck Finn listening to his own eulogy,"" he tweeted, referring to an incident in the Mark Twain novel Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment. The bank's shares closed up 1.6 percent on Friday.
The Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Goldman was not looking beyond presidents and co-chief operating officers Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon to replace him. http://on.wsj.com/2GapHsu
The two men were promoted to their current positions in December 2016. It follows a typical succession plan pattern at the Wall Street bank, which tends to name two or three people into co-head roles until one of them proves to be the right choice for further promotion. 
Schwartz, 53, had been a co-head of trading for several years before being named chief financial officer in 2012. A black-belt in karate, Schwartz moved up the ranks at Goldman Sachs after starting in its commodities trading division, in the same manner as Blankfein. http://reut.rs/13vaOb6
Solomon, 56, had been a co-head of investment banking. Before joining Goldman as a partner in 1999, he spent time in junk bonds and leveraged finance at Salomon Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns. In his spare time, he spins music at clubs under the pseudonym DJ D-Sol. http://reut.rs/lgLk2v
If the power transition does happen soon, it will come as Goldman Sachs is trying to re-invent itself.
For years leading into the crisis and coming out of it, the bank relied heavily on trading to bolster its bottom line. But market trends and regulations implemented since 2010 have sapped profits from the trading business.
After long insisting conditions would eventually reverse, management last year outlined a plan to change the nature of Goldman's trading business by targeting new customers and launching new products, drive more revenue from units such as investment management and push further into consumer lending, a relatively new business for the bank.
Schwartz outlined a target to grow revenue by $5 billion a year in September, after investors pressured the bank to be more transparent about its strategy outlook.
Even with its business challenges, Goldman has remained one of the most profitable big U.S. banks in terms of core earnings relative to shareholder equity. Its stock price has risen 73 percent since Goldman announced in 2006 that Blankfein would become its next CEO through its close on Friday at $270.77.
""Our growth is dependent on the talent of our people, the strength of our culture and the depth and breadth of our client franchise,"" Blankfein said last month. ""I have enormous confidence in our ability to deliver superior returns to the shareholders over the cycle, as I believe we have.""
Blankfein plans to retire at some point in 2019, which will be Goldman's 150th anniversary year, the Journal reported. He was named CEO in June 2006 after Hank Paulson left to become U.S. Treasury Secretary.
His former chief operating officer, Gary Cohn, had waited years to succeed Blankfein and left Goldman to join the Trump administration as White House economic adviser. He said on Tuesday he is resigning, without saying what he would do next.

1405,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 12:01PM ET</span>",BOE Says It's Not to Blame for Century-Old U.S. Financial Crises,"(Bloomberg) -- The Bank of England says its interest-rate changes in the early part of the 20th century didn‚Äôt inflame economic crises in the U.S. at that time.
In a working paper published Friday, BOE analyst Georgina Green said her findings go against an accepted view that the central bank must bear some responsibility.
‚ÄúThe convertibility of currencies into gold and the absence of a U.S. central bank to stem gold outflows led to a consensus in the literature that the Bank was, at least partly, responsible for U.S. crises,‚Äù she wrote. But estimates from her new measure of monetary-policy shocks ‚Äúsuggest that any spillover to the U.S. was small and transitory and did not have important real effects.‚Äù
It‚Äôs not known if the paper is intended to avoid President Donald Trump moving on from trade tariffs to considering retaliatory measures for Britain‚Äôs alleged role in debilitating the U.S. economy more-than a century ago.
If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs not all good news. Green notes that the BOE may still have influenced the development of the U.S. ‚Äúthrough other means‚Äù such as restrictions on gold, as it did in 1906.
The BOE sometimes avoided extreme movement in its interest rate by placing obstacles in the way of gold exports, facilitating imports and charging a premium on the metal.

Montreal (Reuters) - With its new long-range business jet just preparing to take flight, Bombardier is banking on sales of new products and maintenance packages to help it drive promised double-digit revenue growth for its aftermarket service business this year.
Bombardier, which considered bankruptcy in 2015 after facing a cash-crunch, is in the middle of an aggressive turnaround plan that leans on the delivery of its new long-range, Global 7000 business jet to achieve a 25 percent jump in total company revenues to $20 billion by 2020, compared with 2017. 
But with demand now flat for other jets and the new Global 7000 just starting to come off the line this year before picking up the pace in 2019 and 2020, Bombardier is counting on upside from the so-called aftermarket business of servicing existing jets.
The Canadian company expects its business jet division will, by year's end, maintain 35 percent of the 4,700 in-service jets it has sold over the years, up from 25 percent in 2017, according to Bill Molloy, vice president, aftermarket sales and commercial strategy of Bombardier's business jet division.
That will help generate double-digit revenue growth this year from such aftermarket services, which it expects will rise by $500 million in total through 2020, he told Reuters.
Bombardier does not disclose revenue figures for its aftermarket services business, but total revenues from Bombardier‚Äôs business aircraft are expected to grow to $8.5 billion in 2020, up from $5 billion in 2017. 
New requirements for global positioning systems in planes, along with demand for improved avionics, faster internet service and other offerings, are expected to draw in more customers for its jet maintenance.
""You bring the aircraft into your facility and then you've got the opportunity to apply your modifications and upgrades,"" Molloy said.
Meeting those new aftermarket targets is possible given Bombardier‚Äôs recent investment in that side of the business ‚Äì which is already a mainstay for the likes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and other plane makers. 
Bombardier expanded its facility network by a third to 1.5 million square feet, introduced about 30 new product upgrades in its maintenance centers this year and is set to unveil about a dozen more services - including new cockpit displays and global positioning system installations required by U.S. and European regulators.
It also plans to double capacity within the next 18 to 24 months in Florida, a geographically strategic location which serves customers from both the United States and Latin America, while also eying future growth in Asia, Molloy said.
""Maintenance is a very important driver‚Äù of revenues, said Molloy.
Bombardier is expecting greater demand from customers for ADS-B out, which broadcasts the plane's position and will be required by U.S. and European regulators in 2020. 
The demand potential is significant for Bombardier and other jet service providers because according to January 2018 data from the Federal Aviation Administration, only about a third of U.S.-registered business jets and general aviation turboprops currently meet the new regulations.
While the ADS-B is one of many new service offerings, the expectation is that it will spur more customers to bring their planes back, and then combine the visit to Bombardier's centers with more lucrative scheduled maintenance and upgrades.
""You bring the aircraft into your facility and then you've got the opportunity to apply your modifications and upgrades,"" said Molloy. 
The company will further expand its global network of nine service centers by 2020 and expects higher demand for installations next year as owners rush to meet the 2020 aircraft ADS-B installation deadline in the United States and Europe. 
""I can see the mad scramble in 2019,"" Molloy said in an interview. 
A 2019 bottleneck could result because some plane owners are delaying their installations with the hope that ""lower cost options will be available in the next 6-9 months,"" said Warren Peck, president of Phoenix Rising Aviation, an Oklahoma-based maintenance and repair operation specializing in Dassault Aviation SA Falcon jets. 
Ron Smith, a sales manager for business and general aviation at supplier Honeywell Aerospace, said by phone that some installers are already having ""bandwidth limitations to accommodate all the people who are trying to update.""
Honeywell, which makes some of the equipment used to install ADS-B, has seen about a 20 percent increase in those orders during the first two months of 2018, compared with the same period a year earlier. 
The U.S. and European directives follow similar regulations in Australia. And now Canada is weighing whether to add an ADS-B requirement, which could start as early as 2021, said a spokesman for NavCan, the operator of the country's air traffic control services. 

Molloy said Bombardier is taking steps to prepare, including keeping enough parts and staff, in anticipation of an influx demand fueled by ADS-B requirements next year.

The company's supervisory board would grow to 16 members from the current 12, and split its membership evenly between shareholder and employee representatives, abolishing the current bias in favor of shareholder representatives, the company said. 
Deutsche Boerse said a larger board would help it deal with increased demands, growth, greater diversity and a more global operation.
Faber's position as chair had been uncertain after a management reshuffle that followed the resignation last year of former chief executive, Carsten Kengeter, amid allegations of insider trading. Kengeter and the firm denied any wrongdoing.
The board nominated three new shareholder representatives to be ratified at an annual general meeting in May to assume the seats of retiring members.
They include Martin Jetter of IBM's management board, Barbara Lambert of Banque Pictet's board, and Joachim Nagel, a member of the management board of KfW Group.
""The three candidates are a great enrichment to the supervisory board,"" Faber said. ""They will contribute long-standing international expertise and extensive professional knowledge.""

The election process is ongoing for employee representatives of board.

1425,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 11:01AM ET</span>",Blown Earnings Calls Started Bull Market And One Day Will End It,"(Bloomberg) -- As the U.S. equity bull market heads into its 10th year with earnings underpinning the case for buying, consider this: at the most important turning points for stocks in the past decade, profit projections have been laughably wrong.
Take the start of this bull market, nine years ago today. Banks were failing, the economy was shrinking, and stocks had just suffered their worst year in seven decades. Equity forecasters were appropriately grim, predicting a double-digit decline in corporate income that would‚Äôve ranked among the worst ever seen. Instead, earnings rose.
Step back a bit further to October 2007, when shares had gained for five straight years. Analysts were projecting a solid increase in S&P 500 Index profits for the fateful year of 2008. They were off by 41 percentage points.
Of course, estimates aren‚Äôt always that wrong. But assuming they‚Äôre reliable isn‚Äôt a safe bet, either. It‚Äôs a point worth heeding now because Donald Trump‚Äôs tax cuts and an uptick in global growth have analysts boosting earnings estimates at the fastest pace on record. And that profit backdrop has been repeatedly cited by strategists from JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM).‚Äôs Dubravko Lakos-Bujas to Jonathan Golub at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG as reason to buy the dip.
‚ÄúPeople continue to draw a straight line on the path that we‚Äôre on, and we know the world works in cycles and is not necessarily linear,‚Äù said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer of First American Trust in Santa Ana, California, where he helps oversee about $1.3 billion. ‚ÄúAnalyst expectations are fine if the trend continues, but when you have a significant change, growth is overvalued.‚Äù
Volatility Returns
Last month‚Äôs correction, the biggest in two years, occurred side by side with the unprecedented stretch of analyst upgrades. Volatility is returning after a torpid 2017 as Trump, whose $1.5 trillion tax overhaul was greeted with record equity inflows in January, turns toward a protectionist stance on trade. The Federal Reserve, cheerleader of gains that have added $22 trillion to American equity values since 2009, is becoming a less reliable ally too.
Those shifts are forcing investors to reassess the durability of the bull market, according to Joseph Tanious, a senior investment strategist at Bessemer Trust in Los Angeles, which oversees more than $100 billion.
‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs fears of a trade war, whether it‚Äôs inflation starting to pick up, all these things add to anxiety, which ultimately leads to greater levels of volatility,‚Äù said Tanious. ‚ÄúWe had a pretty amazing ride over the last nine years. Statistically it‚Äôs a very long cycle. Understandably investors get nervous.‚Äù
The S&P 500 climbed 0.9 percent to 2,764.47 as of 10:35 a.m. Friday, after labor department data showed inflation fears stirred by last month‚Äôs jobs report may have been overdone. While the U.S. added more workers than expected in February, average hourly earnings increased 2.6 percent from a year earlier, missing expectations for a 2.8 percent gain.
Read more about Trump and the Fed‚Äôs recent impact on stocks.
The bull market is just five months away from becoming the longest ever and at 21 percent, the consensus forecast for 2018 profit growth would top all other years during the rally except for one. But Wall Street‚Äôs record of predictive success doesn‚Äôt exactly instill confidence. From 2007 through 2017, the actual pace of S&P 500 earnings-per-share growth was on average 6 percentage points lower than what analysts had expected at the end of the previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Moreover, history shows that earnings matter less to stock prices when multiples are already high and inflation is rising. Ie, in situations like now.
Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, has found eight instances since 1950 where profits surged and stock prices didn‚Äôt. A common theme among them: stretched valuations and a low unemployment rate. One explanation is that earnings lose the power to drive up share prices when stocks are expensive and the risk of an overheating economy -- as evidenced by a tight labor market -- is rising.
Both concerns are relevant today, with the S&P 500‚Äôs price-earnings ratio hovering around the highest level since the dot-com era and the country‚Äôs jobless rate holding at just 4.1 percent.
‚ÄúEras of robust earnings growth do not always ensure a good stock market,‚Äù Paulsen wrote in a note in late February. ‚ÄúWith most over the moon about what appears to be a tremendous earnings year, perhaps it may make sense to curb your enthusiasm about the stock market?‚Äù
Another hidden risk lies in the slope of the S&P 500 earnings trajectory. While finding fault with bumper growth may seem like looking a gift horse in the mouth, the phenomenon is not necessarily good news.
Ned Davis Research grouped S&P 500 earnings growth since 1927 into five brackets and found that unless it‚Äôs too bad to ignore (down an annual 25 percent or more), income growth tends to have an inverse relationship with market returns. That is, the faster profits grow, the worse stocks perform.
While it sounds counter intuitive, it makes sense in that markets always look ahead. Once the good news on profits is priced in, that doesn‚Äôt leave much room for stocks to keep going.
‚ÄúIt seems too good -- you can‚Äôt model long-term 20 percent growth,‚Äù Lamar Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund who manages $2.1 billion, said in an interview at Bloomberg‚Äôs New York headquarters. ‚ÄúPeople freak out and can‚Äôt believe that can go on indefinitely.‚Äù

The survey by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is for businesses that offer their financial services under EU ""passporting"" rules to customers in Britain from a base in another member state.
Passporting will end when Britain leaves the bloc in March next year and the UK government has said it will legislate, if necessary, to provide a temporary ""permissions"" scheme so that cross-border business can continue for a period of time after Brexit in March 2019.
The results of the survey will help to set up the permissions scheme because the watchdog will not have enough time to process full license applications before Brexit. Britain and the EU hopes to agree a transition deal later this month, which would ease the pressure until the end of 2020.
""We anticipate this notification will be a relatively simple process and that a system to enable firms and funds to do this will be set up ahead of exit day,"" the FCA said on its website.
""Notification will not require the submission of an application for authorization in the UK prior to exit day. We will set out further details on these proposals and how the scheme will operate in due course.""
Survey questions cover contact details, EU laws under which firms are passporting into Britain and the firms' intentions regarding access to Britain's financial market after Brexit.

Mattel's shares fell 6 percent to $14.96, while those of Hasbro dipped nearly 3 percent to $90.75 in early trading. Jakks Pacific Inc (O:JAKK) was down 1 percent at $2.33.
The toy retailer will liquidate its operations if its negotiations with creditors do not result in a deal that can help the company to emerge from bankruptcy, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter.
""The worst case scenario is that about 10 percent of the sales of each of the toy companies goes away in 2018, with an associated roughly 10 percent hit to earnings,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Linda Weiser said.
Talks with creditors are continuing and no decision has yet been taken. The company is also considering other options, including a potential sale in bankruptcy if possible, the source told Reuters.
The retailer said in January it would shut about a fifth of its U.S. stores as it tries to emerge from one of the largest ever bankruptcies by a specialty retailer.
""Mattel's fundamentals and balance sheet are more vulnerable to a liquidation than Hasbro,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analysts, who downgraded Mattel's stock to ""Underweight"".

GM Korea said that without new funding from its major shareholders it would have a first quarter ""cash crisis"".
Barry Engle, President of GM International, said in a company letter seen by Reuters, that the automaker would clean up GM Korea's balance sheet by converting into equity $2.7 billion in debt held by General Motors itself.
Engle said GM would ""fund its portion of the $2.8 billion in investment required to bring products to market and update the tooling and equipment to build them.""
The proposed plans are in line with details previously reported by Reuters.
GM Korea confirmed the content of the letter but said the carmaker's further investments would depend on a deal between it and other parties including the government and the union.
""GM has said it will only provide additional funding if there is agreement on the necessary shared sacrifices with the union, the Government and the KDB,"" GM Korea said in a statement.
KDB is South Korea's state-run bank that owns a 17 percent stake in GM Korea, which said has approached five commercial banks to raise funding, but these has been declined.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's central bank has asked commercial lenders to provide it with details of all letters of undertaking - a form of credit guarantee at the center of an alleged $2 billion fraud - issued by them in the past several years, according to four bankers who have seen the directive.
The regulator is ratcheting up pressure on lenders, increasing its scrutiny and laying down deadlines for them to fix gaps in their systems, in the aftermath of the country's biggest bank fraud.
Two jewelry groups were accused last month of defrauding state-run  Punjab National Bank  (PNB) (NS:PNBK) of more than $2 billion, mostly through fraudulent guarantees based on letters of undertaking (LoUs) issued by rogue bank employees that they used to raise credit overseas. The key accused in the case have denied any wrongdoing.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) wrote to all banks a week ago asking for details of the LoUs they had written, including the amounts outstanding, and whether the banks had pre-approved credit limits or kept enough cash on margin before issuing the guarantees, the sources said.
One of the sources said the regulator had asked for details of LoUs issued as far back 2011, while another said the deadline for banks to respond was earlier this week.
""If there is a¬†problem in one bank, they will be checking the whole system. What's the outstanding? Is it correctly reflecting in the book or not? That kind of thing,"" said a third source, a senior banker.
The RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Importers typically use LoUs issued by their local bank to raise cheaper foreign currency loans overseas to fund purchases.
In the case of PNB, bank employees who have been accused of pulling off the fraud in connivance with companies controlled by jewelers Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, allegedly issued LoUs on behalf of the jeweler groups without any pre-approved limit or margin. Modi and Choksi both deny involvement.
The bank has also said the employees intentionally did not enter the LoUs in the bank's core accounting system to prevent the alleged fraud from being detected.
In sweeping changes to bank protocols after the fraud, the RBI had asked banks to comply within strict deadlines on more than two dozen checkpoints, most notably to connect the SWIFT interbank messaging system with their core banking software by April 30.
Previous central bank letters to banks reviewed by Reuters had shown that the RBI had warned banks as early as in 2016 on technical loopholes that it said could expose the lenders to a heightened risk of fraud, but there was no indication of any fix on most counts.

Separately, a senior PNB executive told Reuters that the bank found ""procedural lapses involving paperwork"" after scanning all its 250 branches that deal with foreign exchange, but added he did not expect its total exposure to the fraud to rise further.

(Reuters) - U.S. stocks extended gains on Friday, with the Nasdaq touching a record, after data showed strong job additions in February but muted wage growth that indicated a gradual rise in inflation and helped temper expectations of faster interest rate increases.
Helping sentiment on Friday, a day when the bull market for stocks turned nine, were signs of a potential breakthrough in nuclear tensions in the Korean peninsula and President Donald Trump's softened stance on tariffs. 
""You got sort of a Goldilocks report with stronger employment, coupled with modest wage growth, but not enough that forces the Fed to act more rapidly than they otherwise would,"" said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. 
Strong jobs data last month fueled speculation that higher wages could lead to faster interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, rattling global equities market.
However, the slow wage growth in February could temper expectations that the Fed will change its rate forecast to four hikes this year from three.
At 11:02 a.m. ET, Dow Jones industrial average (DJI) was up 264.51 points, or 1.06 percent, the S&P 500 (SPX) was up 27.89 points, or 1.02 percent.
The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) was up 79.29 points, or 1.07 percent. The index touched a record of 7,514.34.
The stock markets' bull run appears poised to set the record as the longest in history, buoyed by global economic growth and stronger company earnings.
Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 313,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said, its biggest increase in more than 1-1/2 years.
Average hourly earnings edged up 0.1 percent, a slowdown from the 0.3 percent rise in January. That lowered the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent in January.
Worries that the hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum could ignite a global trade war had roiled markets since last Thursday, with the exit of chief economic adviser Gary Cohn intensifying the concerns.
Among bigger movers, discount retailer Big Lots (N:BIG) slid 9 percent after posting a surprise drop in same-store sales and forecasting a weak profit for the current quarter and the full year. 
Shares of toymakers Hasbro (O:HAS) and Mattel (N:MAT) were lower after sources told Reuters that retailer Toys 'R' Us is preparing for a potential liquidation. 
Tesla (O:TSLA) fell 1.2 percent, following the exit of its chief accounting officer and a  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) note on rising competition.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,923 to 850. On the Nasdaq, 1,904 issues rose and 864 fell.

Some investors and leaders worry the tariffs could create a trade war. The European Union has announced that it will retaliate in a tit-for-tat tariff on American exports like cranberry sauce, Levi jeans, and bourbon.

1461,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 11:08AM ET</span>",Wall Street has never been so far behind on Netflix,"By Sai Sachin Ravikumar
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc's (O:NFLX) 65 percent jump so far in 2018 has been so fast that Wall Street analysts earlier this week were as much as $60 behind the curve on a stock most say is a buy.
The online video streamer's shares have remained well above analysts' average 12-month target for much of this year, and the gap between the actual share price and the mean target hit a two-year high earlier this week, as the graphics below show.
(GRAPHIC: Binge-buying - http://reut.rs/2FpQrI4)
(GRAPHIC: Netflix leaps past Wall Street - http://reut.rs/2FncVK5) 
Like the other FAANG technology stocks, Netflix shares have soared over the past few years, driven by subscriber growth.
While the mean 12-month price target that brokerages have on the shares of Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Facebook Inc  (O:FB), Google-owner Alphabet (O:GOOGL) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) are a little above their actual share price, in contrast the mean target for Netflix is well below its current share price.
That suggests either that shares in the video streaming pioneer are spectacularly overbought, or Wall Street's biggest names have a lot of work to do. 
Three brokerages scrambled to raise their price targets this week, with Pivotal Research raising its target by $100 to $400, while UBS raised its target by $50 to $345.
One of the top-rated analysts for the stock, Stifel's Scott Devitt, cut Netflix from ""buy"" to ""hold"" on Thursday while raising his target to $325 from a previous $283.
""We are attracted to Netflix's business and competitive
position but believe share price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term,"" Devitt said.

Netflix's shares have an intrinsic valuation of $54.95, according to Thomson Reuters data. The stock closed on Thursday at $317, nearly six times that number.

1462,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 06:40AM ET</span>",China says draft rules will allow foreign control of securities firms,"SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's securities regulator on Friday published draft rules for allowing foreign financial institutions to gain control of Chinese securities firms, and it vowed to gradually widen the approved scope of business for joint-venture brokerages.
Beijing's latest move to deregulate its financial sector comes just after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, raising some fears of a trade war between the United States and China.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), citing the draft rules, said the cap on foreign ownership in a Chinese securities firm will be lifted to 51 percent from the existing 49 percent, and the ceiling will be scrapped altogether three years after the new rules take effect.
The elimination of a cap on foreign ownership would fulfill a pledge the Chinese government made in November.
Currently, global investment banks including Goldman Sachs (N:GS), Morgan (N:MS), UBS (S:UBSG) and Credit Suisse (N:C) operate in China through minority-owned local ventures.
Meanwhile, the ceiling of total foreign ownership in a listed Chinese brokerage will also be raised to 51 percent, from 25 percent, but a single foreign shareholder cannot own more than 30 percent of the publicly-traded brokerage, through trading or negotiated transactions. 
In the draft rules, the CSRC raised the bar for overseas investors, saying they must be financial institutions with good international reputations and track records.
The rules will become effective after the CSRC solicits public opinion on them. 
Critics have said Beijing's recent moves to open up its multi-trillion dollar financial sector to foreigners were too little, too late.
Larry Hu, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Ltd, said China is likely acting now in a bid to ease tensions between it and the United States.

To help avert a trade war, China‚Äôs policymakers ""need to offer to further open up its financial sector,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Martin Shkreli, the former drug company executive who made headlines by jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug before he was found guilty of defrauding investors, is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday.
Shkreli, 34, is expected to appear before U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. His lawyers have asked the judge to impose a sentence of 12 to 18 months, while prosecutors have sought at least 15 years.
The Brooklyn-born entrepreneur first became famous as the ""Pharma Bro"" in September 2015 after founding Turing Pharmaceuticals, buying the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raising its price by 5,000 percent, to $750 per pill. Shkreli was indicted for the unrelated securities fraud charges months later, in December 2015.
A jury last August found Shkreli guilty of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by sending them fake account statements and concealing huge losses. He was also convicted of scheming to prop up the stock price of Retrophin Inc, a drug company he founded in 2011.
Shkreli has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered his social media followers $5,000 if they could bring him a hair from former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
Shkreli's lawyers have argued for a lenient sentence in court filings partly on the grounds that his investors eventually made money after Shkreli paid them in stock and cash from Retrophin.
In a letter to the judge last week, Shkreli said he accepted that he had made ""serious mistakes,"" but still considered himself ""a good person with much potential.""
Prosecutors, on the other hand, have argued that Shkreli should not get any credit for what they described as stealing from Retrophin to pay off the investors.
They have also said that Shkreli has not made ""any showing of genuine remorse"" and that he ""continued to privately express disdain for his conviction"" in his communications from jail.

Before he was jailed, Shkreli often seemed to revel in his public reputation, attacking critics and federal prosecutors on social media and in statements to reporters even during his trial.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 12:29PM ET</span>",Bull market aging but still has juice to break record,"By Chuck Mikolajczak
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The bull market for stocks turned nine years old on Friday and, despite being long in the tooth, appears poised to set the record as the longest in history, buoyed by global economic growth and stronger company earnings.
It is unlikely to be a smooth ride, however, as investors have already had to endure a 10-percent market correction sparked by inflation concerns and heightened volatility, which is likely to continue throughout the year.
""Bull markets just don‚Äôt die of old age, they die of recessions and economic slowdowns,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. 
The S&P 500 index has rallied nearly 305 percent since hitting a closing low of 676.53 on March 9, 2009, in large part due to the U.S. Federal Reserve's low interest rate policy in the wake of the financial crisis.
(GRAPHIC: S&P 500 vs 10-yr Yield during bull market - http://reut.rs/2FlB2ZF)
The gains since, uninterrupted by a decline of 20 percent or more, rank this bull market as the second longest ever and about six months behind the bull run from October 1990 to March 2000 during the tech boom.
Gains are expected to continue as global economies are in a period of synchronized growth after years of dealing with the aftereffects of the Great Recession. Also expected to boost equities are improving corporate earnings, aided by a tax overhaul in Washington, which has reduced what was seen by many as stretched valuations. 
""The earnings growth picture for this year continues to get better on a weekly basis,"" said Hogan.
(GRAPHIC: Stock valuations during bull run - http://reut.rs/2FngM9I) 
With fourth-quarter earnings reporting nearly complete, S&P 500 companies scored growth of 15.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That growth rate is currently expected to be topped in each quarter in 2018, highlighted by earnings growth of 21.9 percent in the third quarter. 
The strong earnings growth could turn into a headwind, however, as results this year will be tough to top in 2019.
""When you look to 2019, it'll be very hard to repeat those numbers,"" said Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at  Schroders  (LON:SDR) Investment Management in New York. 
""Next year will probably not be as good. Then you're probably getting into the last stages of the cycle.""
A recent poll by Reuters showed stocks will build on the recent recovery from a sell-off earlier this month to rack up an over-8-percent gain for the year, led by corporate profits and a robust economic expansion.
Since the correction low on Feb. 8, the Dow and S&P have yet to regain prior levels, while the Nasdaq hit a record on Friday, powered by a gain of nearly 14 percent in the technology sector. 
For a graphic on more bull market details, click: http://tmsnrt.rs/2n7RoYW
But concerns about an overheating economy that could force the Fed to increase its path of interest rate hikes could derail the bull market. Data in January on climbing wages sparked a quick rise in yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note toward 3 percent and pushed the S&P 500 down more than 10 percent in a 9-day span.
""If your economy can‚Äôt handle that growth that quickly, then we run into shortages and then we have a business cycle on our hands,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth in Chicago.
U.S stocks rallied more than 1 percent on Friday, as February job growth recorded its biggest increase in more than 1-1/2 years while also showing wage gains slowed, tamping down inflation worries. 
A lack of progress in talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the possibility of a global trade war in light of recent tariffs announced by the Trump administration, are also causes for concern. 
""Obviously anything, trade talk, political event risk, certainly could create problems but right now there is certainly a valid concern out there that ripping up NAFTA would create a whole litany of uncertainties,"" said Ablin. 
On Thursday, President Donald Trump pressed ahead with the imposition of 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminum but exempted Canada and Mexico, backtracking from earlier pledges of tariffs on all countries.
Recent data has helped ease the concerns about overheating, however, and make it likely this bull still has room to run. 
""The trend of higher wages is probably more in line with what is actually happening, it is just more of a steadier pace higher,"" said Matt Forester, Chief Investment Officer of BNY Mellon's Lockwood Advisors in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. 

""We probably got a little overexcited about what wages were going to do and the market got a little ahead of itself building that in.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) lost 28 billion rupees ($431 million) to various frauds last fiscal year, the government said on Friday, making it the biggest such loser among all state-owned banks even before it uncovered an alleged $2 billion fraud this year.
The country's second-biggest state-owned bank in February accused two high-profile jewelers and their companies of colluding with rogue bank employees to secure credit from overseas lenders using fraudulent guarantees between 2010 and 2017.
This has been dubbed as the biggest bank fraud in India's history, but the finance ministry told parliament that even before the fraud came to light, state banks lost a total of 195.33 billion rupees to 2,718 cases of fraud in the year that ended on March 31, 2017.
Punjab National, better known as PNB, alone reported 158 cases of fraud in 2016/17, the ministry said. PNB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In monetary terms PNB was followed by  Bank of India  (NS:BOI), which lost 27.7 billion rupees, and  State Bank of India  (NS:SBI) that lost 24.2 billion rupees, the ministry said.
The ministry did not specify the nature of the frauds but added that the central bank recently formed an expert committee to look into ""factors leading to increasing incidence of frauds in banks and the measures needed to curb and prevent it"".
The committee will also look into the role of auditors in checking frauds.
Reuters reported last month that India's state-run banks reported 8,670 ""loan fraud"" cases totaling 612.6 billion rupees over the last five financial years up to March 31, 2017.
In India, loan fraud typically refers to cases where the borrower intentionally tries to deceive the lending bank and does not repay the loan.
A parliamentary committee on finance said in a report on Friday that it was ""extremely concerned about the recent fraud detected in Punjab National Bank, which clearly reflects that a small group of individuals can manipulate such a gigantic bank and compromise it despite such well laid out norms, guidelines, checks and balances.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) -  Union Bank of India  (NS:UNBK) has direct credit exposure of about 1.2 billion rupees ($18.4 million) to companies controlled by jeweler Nirav Modi, and another 1.75 billion rupees ($26.9 million) to Gitanjali group of companies, its chief executive told Reuters on Friday.
Companies belonging to Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, who heads the Gitanjali group, have been accused by  Punjab National Bank  (NS:PNBK) of defrauding the bank of over $2 billion. The bank alleges firms controlled by the duo colluded with rogue PNB staff to secure fraudulent guarantees that were used to raise credit from overseas branches of Indian banks.
Both Modi and Choksi have denied wrongdoing, and so have two key accused PNB employees in the case, which has so far led to 19 people being arrested.
The latest Union Bank figures are separate from the $300 million exposure it had previously reported on account of the fraudulent PNB guarantees, said Rajkiran Rai, Chief Executive of state-run Union Bank.
This week, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) filed a new complaint against jeweler Modi alleging that companies he controlled had misused even legitimate loans and guarantees.
Lenders including Union Bank have recalled loans to Modi's and Choksi's firms after the news of the fraud, according to the authorities.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese pig prices hit their lowest in nearly four years this week, plunging farmers in the world's top pork market into the red and underscoring concerns that a rapid expansion of large pig farms in China has outpaced slowing demand growth. 
The sudden downturn - one of the steepest declines over such a short period ever - will mark the first serious test for many companies that have rushed into pig farming in the last two years. 
It will also slow imports of pork by the world's top buyer, traders and analysts say. The price is set to recover when demand picks up later in the year but will come under renewed pressure in 2019 as more new farms start production, analysts say.
Live pig prices are now hovering just above 11 yuan ($1.74) per kilogram in major producing areas such as Henan. That's below average production costs, after plunging more than 20 percent from early January when they were close to 16 yuan per kg.
""The reason is very clear. There are a lot of pigs on the market,"" said Feng Yonghui, chief researcher at trade website Soozhu.com.
The sudden plunge in prices is the result of conflicting trends in the industry over the last year. On the one hand, big producers have expanded rapidly to grow market share, but on the other, a government crackdown on pollution that intensified in 2017 shut many small farms, making it difficult to get an accurate picture of supply. ¬†
Monthly government data continues to show a drop in the number of breeding pigs, suggesting supply has not yet caught up with demand.
That kept market prices high throughout the winter and led Beijing to release some pork from its reserves. Though volumes released were small, it was another signal of insufficient supply that ""misled"" the market, said Pan Chenjun, senior analyst at Rabobank. 
Graphic: http://reut.rs/2DdW0DD
NEW YEAR'S ABUNDANCE
Abundant supplies became evident in the run-up to mid-February's Lunar New Year festivities, China's peak pork consumption period.
""Slaughterhouses took advantage of the increased supply to set prices, which led to growing price pressure in the market,"" said Feng.
Prices in February in seven major provinces fell at their fastest pace on Reuters records going back to 2012.
Graphic: http://reut.rs/2FmPKPT
In some regions, farmers are struggling to sell their pigs at prices as low as 10.2 yuan per kg.
A small farmer from Daqing city in northeastern Heilongjiang province said she now has pigs weighing 140kg, well over average slaughter weights of 110kg, as they grow fatter on the farm instead of heading to the slaughterhouse.
""Now, two pigs sold at the current price account for the costs I spend on raising one pig,"" said Ms. Wang. She declined to give her full name.
Large players are losing money too. 
Costs at Muyuan Foods Co Ltd, China's No. 2 pig producer, are around 11.5 yuan per kg, chairman Qin Yinglin said on the sidelines of China's annual parliament meeting.
BETTING ON REBOUND 
Plentiful supplies will curb appetite for overseas pork, extending last year's slowdown in purchases. China imported 1.2 million tonnes of pork last year, down 25 percent on the prior year. 
""With the large drop in domestic pig prices, the space for imported pork is less and less,"" said Feng. 
For now, most farmers are preparing to ride out the downturn, betting on a rebound in a few months time.
""Losses are temporary. It won't go too far or too long,"" said Qin.
Muyuan will not change its growth plans, he added. It aims to increase the number of pigs slaughtered to 12 million this year up from last year's 7 million.
Wen Pengcheng, former chairman of top producer Guangdong Wen's Foodstuff Co Ltd, also shrugged off the impact of low prices, saying the firm's production will rise this year by 15 to 20 percent.
A prolonged downturn could hit some less efficient producers, however, with major repercussions for the global grains sector. China buys 60 percent of the world's soybeans to feed its livestock.
""This year big farms can still make some margins but next year probably everyone will make losses,"" said Pan at Rabobank.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 04:28AM ET</span>",Exclusive: UBS plans to shift some staff to Frankfurt after Brexit - memo,"By Sinead Cruise, Angelika Gruber and Lawrence White
ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS (S:UBSG) has told employees that the majority of those affected by Brexit will move to Frankfurt from London, setting out what it called a decentralized approach to relocating staff.
The moves are expected to affect fewer than 200 UBS staff, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters. UBS employs around 5,000 people in London.
Staff affected will be informed in the next few months and relocations will depend on where clients are based, according to a company memo seen by Reuters.
Separately, the Swiss bank said in its annual report on Friday that it will merge UBS Limited, its British entity, into UBS Europe SE, its German headquartered European bank, in the absence of a transition deal between Britain and the EU.
That would take place prior to Britain leaving the European Union on 29 March, 2019.
""After a thorough analysis, which included your feedback, we have opted for a more decentralized model and plan to leverage our existing UBS Europe SE and its extensive branch network,"" UBS's investment banking chief Andrea Orcel said in the memo.
The plans announced by UBS are the latest sign of how banks are starting to execute on Brexit contingency plans after British Prime Minister Theresa May ruled out retaining passporting rights for financial services.
The loss of these passporting rights - which currently enable finance firms to freely offer financial, advisory and trading services to corporate clients across all EU states via just one local license - is a major concern for banks. 

Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said this week it was starting to transfer some senior bankers to Frankfurt in preparation for Britain's exit from the EU.  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN) has started interviewing candidates for about 20 jobs it is moving to Frankfurt, its chief financial officer told Reuters.

It was upbeat jobs data last month that fanned speculation of faster rate rises in the United States, causing a rout in the bond market and hammering world equities.

British satellite company  Inmarsat  (L:ISA) slipped 6.2 percent after it said it would lower its dividend in 2018 and beyond to fund an investment drive in its aviation division after core earnings fell in the fourth quarter.

German industrial output data did little to lift sentiment, falling unexpectedly in January and signaling that factories in Europe's largest economy are operating at a slower pace at the start of the year.

Mitsugu Yamaguchi, 60, currently executive vice president, will replace Hiroya Kawasaki, who said on Tuesday he would step down from April 1 to take responsibility for the fraud that the company admitted has been going on for nearly five decades.
Naming a CEO and president from a business segment other than Kobe Steel's mainstay steel business or its general affairs division is rare for Japan's third-biggest steelmaker, which is seeking to change its corporate culture.
""Under a new management structure, Kobe Steel will move forward with fundamental reforms to the organization and its corporate culture in an effort to restore the trust of everyone as quickly as possible,"" the company said in a statement.
Yamaguchi, who will hold a press conference next Friday, faces a difficult challenge to rebuild credibility at the 112-year-old company.
Kobe Steel, which supplies steel parts to manufacturers of cars, planes and trains around the world, admitted last year to supplying products with falsified specifications to about 500 customers, throwing global supply chains into turmoil.
Releasing results from a four-month-long investigation by an external committee on Tuesday, it said it had found new cases of impropriety, widening the total of affected clients to 605, including 222 customers overseas.
The company's steel division is one of eight business segments and accounted for about 40 percent of total sales in the nine months to end-December and about a third of total recurring profit.
The company's data tampering came mostly from its aluminum and copper division, but some cheating cases were found at the steel division. 

The Kobe Steel case, one of the country's biggest industrial scandals in recent memory, set off a rash of malfeasance revelations by other Japanese heavyweights, hitting the country's reputation for manufacturing excellence.

""Confirmed,"" her lawyer, Nancy Smith, tweeted to Reuters when asked if Falzone had reached a settlement and no longer worked at the television channel.
Fox News officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Smith's announcement, which was first reported by CNN. Fox denied Falzone's allegations after she filed her lawsuit in May, 2017. 
In her complaint in New York state court, Falzone said she was abruptly taken off air by Fox News after writing an article in January 2017 about her struggle with endometriosis, a medical condition that would likely leave her infertile.
She said Fox, a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc, discriminated against her on the basis of sex and disability in violation of New York City law. 
Fox executives decided she did not conform to their image of on-air women as ""physically perfect"" once she disclosed her condition, Smith said in a statement at the time.
In its June 23 response to Falzone's complaint, Fox said it maintained an equal employment, harassment-free work environment where personnel decisions were made on the basis of merit, and retaliation was prohibited against anyone who reported a discrimination claim.
Fox News has faced a number of legal claims that it ignored employees' complaints of sexual harassment and gender and race discrimination. 
Bill O'Reilly, the network's most popular anchor, and former Fox News chief Roger Ailes both have been ousted over harassment claims by several women, which they deny.
Smith and Martin Hyman filed a sexual harassment lawsuit last year against Ailes on behalf of former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson. The lawsuit, which was settled for $20 million, led to Ailes' resignation after two decades as one of the most influential executives in cable television.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 11:01PM ET</span>","Tesla chief Musk says China trade rules uneven, asks Trump for help","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk took to Twitter on Thursday to call on U.S. President Donald Trump to challenge China's auto trade rules, which limit foreign ownership of Chinese ventures and impose steep tariffs on imported cars.
In a series of tweets aimed at the president, Musk said he was ""against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It's like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes.""
Tesla has been pushing hard to build cars in China, the world's largest auto market, but has hit roadblocks in negotiations with local authorities, in part because Musk is keen to keep full control of any local venture.
""No U.S. auto company is allowed to own even 50 percent of their own factory in China, but there are five 100 percent China-owned EV (electric vehicle) auto companies in the U.S.,"" Musk wrote in another tweet.
Tesla ""raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable,"" he said.
Trump quoted one of Musk's tweets in his announcement on new tariffs and said American automakers have not been treated fairly by trade rules around the world. Trump announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Thursday.
Politicians ""have known it for years and never did anything about it. It's got to change,"" Trump said, saying he plans to impose a ""reciprocal tax"" on other countries. ""We're changing things,"" Trump added. ""We just want fairness.""
Tesla has sought to build a factory in the Chinese financial capital of Shanghai, and last November Musk said he hoped the plant would be operating within three years. However, Tesla and Chinese authorities have yet to announce an agreement.
The Shanghai Municipal Commission of Commerce did not immediately respond to calls and faxed requests for comment. Telsa officials in China declined to comment.
China has said it will look to lower import taxes for cars and carry out a pilot scheme to loosen foreign ownership rules for new energy vehicles, a term China uses to refer to fully-electric and plug-in hybrid cars.
FAIR OUTCOME?
Late Thursday, Musk struck a more hopeful tone. ""To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing,"" he said on Twitter.
Tesla shares closed down 1 percent on Thursday and were off nearly another percent in after-market trading.
China, which is making a major push toward electric cars, requires foreign automakers to build factories in 50-50 joint ventures with domestic Chinese automakers and not allowed them to establish wholly owned factories.
Trump told Reuters in an interview in January that ""we have helped to build China because they have taken out so much money in terms of trade deficits with this country.""
He added that ""when China or another country charges us 50 percent tariffs ‚Äì more than that in some cases ‚Äì and we charge them nothing, that's not fair. That's not fair.""
China levies a 25 percent duty on sales of imported vehicles. Those are problems for Tesla, which wants to expand its presence in China's growing electric vehicle market without compromising its independence or intellectual property.
Musk noted that a U.S. car ""going to China pays 25 percent import duty, but a Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5 percent, a tenfold difference."" He asked Trump: ""Do you think the US & China should have equal & fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints & other factors.""
Trump said the United States plans to charge countries a ""mirror tax"" for what American products face.

Musk has met with Trump on several occasions since his election in November 2016. In June 2017, Musk withdrew from a pair of White House advisory councils after Trump said he would withdraw from the Paris climate accord.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 12:54AM ET</span>",Wynn Resorts to pay $2.6 billion to settle lawsuit with Japan's Universal,"By Rushil Dutta and Farah Master
(Reuters) -  Wynn Resorts Ltd  (O:WYNN) has agreed to pay $2.6 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by Japan's  Universal Entertainment  Corp (T:6425) and its U.S. unit, ending a six-year old dispute that pitted casino mogul Steve Wynn against his former associate Kazuo Okada.
The size of the compensation was lower than market expectations and sent shares in Universal, a maker of Japanese-style slot machines and the operator of a casino in the Philippines, plunging 16 percent in Thursday trade in Tokyo. 
The lawsuit relates to Wynn Resorts' 2012 forced redemption of a stake held by Universal's unit Aruze USA at a 30 percent discount after an internal investigation by former FBI director Louis Freeh alleged Okada had violated U.S. anti-corruption laws.
Universal accused Wynn Resorts' board of breaching its fiduciary duties and violating racketeering laws by voting to redeem the shares. 
Under the settlement, Wynn Resorts will pay a total $2.6 billion including the principal amount of the redemption note and interest owed by March 31, Universal Entertainment's law firm, Buckley Sandler LLP, said in a statement.
The 24.5 million shares, equivalent to around 20 percent of Wynn Resorts at the time of the lawsuit, are now worth around $4.4 billion.
Shares in the Japanese firm tumbled by their daily trading limit of 1,000 yen, shrinking its market value to around $4 billion. 
The settlement resolves all claims between Wynn Resorts, Universal and Aruze, its then directors and executives with respect to the redemption, Wynn Resorts said in a separate statement.
Wynn quit as CEO of Wynn Resorts last month, following claims he subjected women who worked for him to unwanted advances. Wynn has previously denied the accusations.
Okada last year lost his board position at Universal with the board accusing him of misappropriating $20 million in funds. Okada has previously denied this.
Okada was also ousted as director of a Hong Kong investment company that controls Universal Entertainment amid a rift with family members over money and control.

Investors‚Äô mood was also brightened earlier in the day after Trump followed through on his pledge to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum, but excluding Canada and Mexico and said he would leave the door open to spare other countries on the basis of national security. The tariffs would come into effect in 15 days.
Following the announcement, several major trading partners of the U.S. have said they would respond with tariffs or direct action of their own.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 08:05AM ET</span>","Shares set to end week back in black, U.S. jobs report eyed","By Ritvik Carvalho
LONDON (Reuters) - World shares hit a one-week high on Friday before easing a touch, as caution ahead of jobs data in the United States outweighed a potential breakthrough in nuclear tensions over the Korean peninsula.
The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries was flat on the day, but set for a weekly gain of almost 2 percent. Wall Street futures indicated a positive open.
Investors' focus was mainly on the U.S. jobs report due at 1330 GMT. Upbeat jobs data last month, particularly a stronger than expected rise in wages, fanned speculation about faster interest rate rises in the United States, causing a rout in the bond market and hammering world equities. 
The consensus expectation for average hourly earnings for the month is for a 0.2 percent increase, while the headline non-farm payrolls is seen to have grown by 200,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll.
""It's expected to drop a little to 2.8 percent (year-on- year), which is still up there with the highest we've seen since the financial crisis, but if it can go above 3 percent, rate hike expectations could start to tick up again,"" said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam.
The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at least three times this year, with some analysts even expecting four.
After opening lower, pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.1 percent by 1244 GMT. Germany's DAX was down 0.4 percent, while Britain's FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent.
Gains for world stocks, however, came largely from shares in Asia, which staged sharp rallies after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was prepared to meet North Korea's Kim Jong Un, potentially marking a major breakthrough in nuclear tensions between the two countries.
Japan's Nikkei rose 0.5 percent and South Korean stocks gained more than 1 percent.
News that the United States is pressing ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminum imports did not seem to rattle investors as much as the initial proposals for them did last week. 
""So far the tariffs are mainly symbolic, as imports of steel and aluminum only account for 2 percent of total imports of goods in the U.S. and it remains our base case that this is not going to evolve into a full-blown global trade war, as it would hurt everyone economically,"" strategists at Danske Bank wrote in a research note.
YEN DIVES
In currencies, the Japanese yen was the biggest mover, falling more than half a percent against the dollar to its lowest in over a week following the news on North Korea.
The drop followed the Bank of Japan's policy meeting, where it kept monetary policy unchanged and stuck to its upbeat view of the economy. The yen has gained 7 percent against the dollar since the start of the year on concerns that the outbreak of a trade war would derail a global growth recovery. [FRX/]
""We are trying to find a bottom on dollar/yen and the other thing to watch for is when the typical year-end repatriation flows that are made by Japanese institutions for the fiscal year end abates, and that might push dollar/yen even higher,"" said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN).
The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.1 percent on the day.
The euro was down 0.1 percent. 
Rising protectionism was a risk cited on Thursday by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi following the central bank's latest policy meeting.
While the ECB did drop its easing bias as some expected, Draghi sounded in no rush to start unwinding the bank's stimulus.
Crude oil futures rose. U.S. crude rose 1 percent to $60.71 per barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 1.2 percent to $64.36 per barrel. 

Spot gold eased 0.2 percent to $1,319.16 per ounce, extending losses into a third session as demand for safe havens lessened.

1499,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 05:01PM ET</span>",Traders Baffled as Focus Shifts From Tariffs to Jobs -- and Back,"(Bloomberg) -- Sometimes in the stock market a month can seem like a lifetime ago. This is one of those times.
In February, in the absence of virtually any bad news for stocks, a report showing the U.S. was adding jobs at a faster-than-forecast pace shook investors‚Äô earnings euphoria and tax-cut optimism, triggering a selloff based on inflation fears that resulted in a 10 percent correction in the S&P 500 Index.
Fast forward a month, and suddenly Friday‚Äôs pending jobs report doesn‚Äôt seem quite so crucial. After all, President Donald Trump‚Äôs top economic adviser is leaving the White House as fear of a trade war grips markets from Canada to Australia. The European central bank is shifting its monetary policy. And the S&P 500 is struggling to find direction after a recent rout.
‚ÄúInvestors are clinging to every trade-related word that comes out of the White House, unsure if they need to put their helmet on or prepare for a relief rally, and this big unknown is what‚Äôs causing the volatility,‚Äù said Chad Morganlander, a portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors.
Global markets have been swinging since late last week, as Trump‚Äôs threats of steel and aluminum tariffs were met with talk of retaliation in China and Europe. The U.S. president signed a proclamation Thursday afternoon that put the tariffs in effect but excluded Canada and Mexico and left the door open to sparing other countries on the basis of national security. The S&P 500 rallied 0.5 percent Thursday, down from its intraday high, while small caps slid for the first time in five sessions.
At some point, global concerns about trade will subside and investors will have to shift their attention back to economic fundamentals. A Bloomberg survey shows that Wall Street expects the jobless rate to fall to 4 percent and hourly pay growth to slip to 2.8 percent from 2.9 percent in the 12 months through February.
‚ÄòEnjoy The Respite‚Äô
Credit Suisse‚Äôs chief equity strategist Jonathan Golub advises his clients to focus on the jobs data and not so much on the prospect of a trade war. Why? Because Trump‚Äôs tariffs won‚Äôt have the same effect on business cycle, Federal Reserve policy and profit margins as higher wages growth.
Some investors disagree, saying that the expectation of more rate hikes is already baked into equity valuations. That‚Äôs not the case for the prospect of a full-fledged trade war, which could curb economic growth and shrink corporate profit margins.
‚ÄúRight now the tariffs are going to be thing that roils the market or lifts it up,‚Äù said Stephen Carl, head trader at Williams Capital Group. ‚ÄúNot that the jobs data isn‚Äôt important, of course it is. But the tariff talk and the tariffs‚Äô impact on our neighbors is going to be front of the ledger at the moment.‚Äù
Still, the market‚Äôs attention will invariably have to shift back to jobs data before long, according to Leuthold Group‚Äôs Jim Paulsen.
‚ÄúEnjoy the respite,‚Äù Paulsen said. ‚ÄúWhether tomorrow‚Äôs wage number is too hot, too cold, or just right, a move to a 4 percent unemployment rate would put the economy in rarefied air and, at least by historical standards, on a new and more aggressive wage path during the balance of this recovery.‚Äù

KFC on Thursday said it would switch the distribution contract back to Bidvest Logistics, from DHL and partner QSL, for up to 350 restaurants in the north of the UK. It will continue to work with DHL and QSL for the remainder of its roughly 900 restaurants in the UK and Ireland. 
""We've been working hard to resolve the present situation with QSL and DHL. This decision will ease pressure at DHL's Rugby depot, to help get our restaurants back to normal as quickly as possible,"" KFC said in a statement.
KFC said more than 97 percent of its UK restaurants are open for business, but ""there will be some limited menus before we are back to business as usual.""

The crisis in the UK market, which accounted for roughly 3 percent of Yum's 2017 global system sales, comes as a business turnaround at the fried chicken chain was taking hold.

1. Will Bullish US Labor Market Data Trigger Another Stock Market Selloff? 
Nonfarm payrolls data on Friday 08.30 a.m. ET, arguably one of the most important economic events of the month, is expected to show the US economy created 200,00 jobs In February.
Economists forecast the jobless rate to decline to 4% while average hourly earnings for February is expected to fall to 0.2% from 0.3% in the previous month.
Investors will assess the nonfarm payrolls report for clues on the strength of the economy which could provide fresh direction for the dollar, United States 2-Year and the US stock market.
The previous jobs report in January showed an uptick in wage growth, raising expectations for a faster pace of rate, which triggered a major sell-off in markets. While United States 10-Year yields soared to four year highs.
In the Federal Reserve‚Äôs beige book report Wednesday, the central bank reported most districts saw employers raise wages and expand benefit packages in response to tight labor market conditions.
2. Canada Jobs Data To Show Rebound In Labor Market 
The Canadian labor market data is expected have rebounded in February after surprise slump in the previous month left many traders questioning the underlying strength of the economy.
Economists forecast Canada employment change to show 20,000 new jobs were created in February compared with a 88,000 decline in the previous month.
The participation rate is expected to remain steady at 65.6% while economists forecast the unemployment rate to show an unchanged reading for February.
The Bank of Canada on Wednesday left interest rate unchanged amid concerns over the labor market and uncertainties related to trade.
President Donald Trump on Thursday, as expected, signed a pair of tariffs on alumium and steel but exempted Canada and Mexico provided they were open to renegotiating NAFTA on terms more favourable to the U.S.
USD/CAD fell 0.08% to C$ 1.2902.
3. Baker Hughes Rig Count to Seal Two-Week Slump in Crude Oil Prices?
The weekly instalment of drilling activity from Baker Hughes on Friday, will provide investors with fresh insight into U.S. oil production and demand after data last week showed the number of oil rigs operating in the US rose by one to 800, the highest level since April 2, 2015.
The weekly rig count is an important barometer for the drilling industry and serves as a proxy for oil production and oil services demand.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2018 12:41AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing has 'cash horsepower' for targeted acquisitions - CEO,"By Tim Hepher
CHICAGO (Reuters) - The head of  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Thursday the U.S. planemaker can absorb transactions on the scale of a proposed tie-up with Brazil's Embraer without putting at risk internal investments in its business or returning cash to shareholders.
Chairman and Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also told Reuters in an interview that Boeing was ""making progress"" in talks with the Brazilian aerospace company. It continues to study a number of possible structures for a deal, which some outside analysts have said could value Embraer at $5-6 billion.
""Acquisitions of the scale of Embraer are not only very doable for us, they are also things we can selectively do, aligned with our (cash deployment) strategy,"" Muilenburg said.
""We have plenty of cash horsepower to do all three things: invest organically, return to shareholders and then make these targeted acquisitions,"" he added.
Boeing is targeting operating cashflow of $15 billion and combined research & development and capital expenditure of $5.9 billion this year. It has pledged to return 100 percent of free cashflow to shareholders.
Brazilian President Michel Temer is weighing a proposal for the two companies to forge a commercial aviation venture, his office said last week, after the government opposed an outright takeover of Embraer which also builds military aircraft.
""We are not done yet; there is still work to go. But we are making progress so I am hopeful that we can complete it,"" Muilenburg said, reiterating the deal was not a ""must"" for Boeing.
""We continue to evaluate all parts of the enterprise, different potential ownership structures"" that range from support to full ownership, he said.
Boeing shares closed up 0.5 percent at $348.73.
Asked whether such overseas tie-ups were more difficult with rising protectionist sentiment, Muilenburg said Boeing would not let up on its global expansion which, if done strategically, would increase jobs in the United States and abroad.
OPEN TRADE
Speaking in his 36th-floor Chicago office with views across to Lake Michigan, Muilenburg declined to be drawn on the issue of steel and aluminum tariffs just prior to U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement about them on Thursday.
He reiterated his longstanding general support for open trade. ""Our position is we want free and open trade, good solid global trade is good for our business and we are going to be strong proponents of that,"" he said.
Muilenburg downplayed concerns of a backlash from China, which has ordered thousands of jets. Boeing plans to open a new aircraft completion plant in China.
""You see some tough rhetoric but when I look below the surface, and having talked with both President Trump and President Xi (Jinping), I think there is a true desire to have a productive trade relationship between the two countries,"" he said.
Muilenburg said Boeing had not decided whether to appeal after losing a price dumping case against Canada's Bombardier (TO:BBDb) but would sue again if provoked to do so again.
He said Boeing was in ""no rush"" to decide whether to launch a new mid-market jetliner, which could enter service in 2024-25.
""It is a decision we will probably get to over the next year or so,"" he said. 
The jet is expected to pioneer an advanced production system for Boeing, which is already building on record output of its smaller 737s, Muilenburg said, noting that suppliers are keeping up with demand.
Asked about engine makers, most of which have faced technical or management problems in recent years, Muilenburg said: ""It is certainly something we are keeping an eye on. I will say that despite some of the challenges you have seen out there, our engine partners have been doing well on our commercial programs.""
Boeing's biggest supplier,  General Electric  Co (N:GE), is undergoing a corporate makeover after heavy losses, but it is delivering engines on time for the 737 MAX through its CFM venture with  Safran  (PA:SAF) of France, Muilenburg said. Airbus has voiced concern about delays in similar CFM engines.
GE, whose stock was the worst performer in the Dow Jones industrial average last year as Boeing led the index higher, is coping well with the development of a new engine for the 777X jet, he said.

""While it is an area to watch, I feel comfortable with where we are at,"" Muilenburg said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin said Thursday his office is investigating possible customer abuses by employees of  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's brokerage division.
Galvin's investigation comes a week after Wells Fargo announced its own internal review into whether employees at its brokerage, Wells Fargo Advisors, recommended unsuitable investments or made inappropriate referrals or recommendations related to advisory accounts or 401(k) roll-overs.
Wells Fargo Advisors spokeswoman Shea Leordeanu said in an emailed statement that the firm has made ""significant progress in our work to identify and fix any issues, make things right and build a better, stronger company.""
The third-largest U.S. bank also said it is reviewing whether clients were overcharged for certain fiduciary and custody accounts in a part of the wealth management business that handles trusts, according to its annual 10-K U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Wells Fargo's internal review was prompted by requests from federal regulators, and the Massachusetts state secretary said his office is asking for information about the scope of the investigation.
The bank has been dogged by scandal since September 2016 when it reached a $190 million settlement with the federal and state regulators related to the opening of 3.5 million accounts for customers without their permission by Wells Fargo employees seeking to hit sales targets.
""Wells Fargo's recent banking scandal, which involved opening bogus accounts for their customers, leads me to believe that where there is smoke, there's fire,"" Galvin said in a statement. ""I need to be assured that Massachusetts residents haven't been burned by corporate greed.""

1510,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 07:03PM ET</span>",Tesla's $2.6 billion stock award for Musk is too high: ISS,"By Nivedita Bhattacharjee
(Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Thursday recommended Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) stockholders reject a multi-billion-dollar, 10-year pay package for Chief Executive Elon Musk, saying the ""unprecedented"" award was too rich.
The compensation arrangement announced in January involves no salary or cash bonus but sets up rewards for Musk based in part on electric vehicle maker Tesla's market value rising to $650 billion over the next 10 years, from around $56 billion currently.
Palo Alto, California based Tesla is under pressure as its much-anticipated Model 3 sedan has already missed several key production targets.
ISS calculated the award was worth $3.7 billion on the grant date, compared with the $2.6 billion projected by Tesla. It joins advisory firm Glass Lewis in recommending against the proposal.
Tesla shareholders are due to vote on March 21, and the company needs majority approval for the proposal to go through. The company declined to comment.
The award ""locks in unprecedented high pay opportunities for the next decade, and seemingly limits the board's ability to meaningfully adjust future pay levels in the event of unforeseen events or changes in either performance or strategic focus,"" ISS said on Thursday.
The advisory firm also flagged that a big part of the award could be earned even if Tesla, which reported its worst ever loss in the fourth quarter, does not sustainably make profits in the future.
""Musk's financial interests are already strongly aligned with Tesla; it is questionable whether an additional $2.6 billion grant is necessary or appropriate to further align his interests when he already owns a 22 percent stake in the company,"" ISS added.
Some analysts have questioned whether billionaire Musk's other interests, from space exploration to tunnel boring technology, are a distraction at what is seen as a critical time for Tesla.
Musk took to Twitter on Thursday to call on U.S. President Donald Trump to challenge Chinese auto trade rules.

Tesla shares were down half a percent at $327.25 after markets closed on Thursday.

Macron, a pro-business centrist who swept to power last year, has been beating the drum for France as a new, modernized ""startup nation"" on the world stage, while he pushes ahead with a wide-ranging program of reforms at home.
He has also used Britain's decision to leave the European Union to pitch France as an investment destination at the heart of the European single market.
""Your historical partner in Europe was the UK, and I want France to become the new partner,"" Macron told India Today in an interview published on its website. ""I want France to become the reference partner of the 21st century.""
The 40-year-old president, who is traveling with a delegation of French companies that includes EDF (PA:EDF), Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), Schneider Electric (PA:SCHN) and Suez (PA:SEVI), will also inaugurate a solar plant built by Engie (PA:ENGIE) in Uttar Pradesh.
""I think India has to operate much more with Europe and the European Union as a whole. I want France to be its entry point,"" Macron said.
""I want your creativity, your entrepreneurship, your young people to be much more present in France. Much more known and recognized. And I want to see the same from the French side.""
India was the third-largest source of foreign direct investment into Britain in 2015, contributing to its position as Europe's top destination for foreign direct investment, according to official British figures. By comparison, India was only the 30th largest investor in France, according to 2013 Bank of France figures. 
Among recent wins for France is India's purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets from Dassault in 2016. It beat out the Eurofighter Typhoon, which is built by a European consortium that includes Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES).

But talks to sell six new-generation EPR nuclear reactors built by state utility EDF and Areva have dragged on.

1519,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 01:40PM ET</span>",Disney shareholders vote against executive compensation,"(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) said on Thursday its shareholders, in a non-binding vote, rejected the executive compensation plan for Chief Executive Bob Iger and other leaders of the entertainment and theme park company.
Fifty-two percent of the shareholders voted against Disney's compensation plan, according to preliminary results announced at the company's annual shareholder meeting. Forty-four percent voted in favor of the compensation plan while four percent abstained.
""The board accepts the result of today‚Äôs non-binding vote and will take it under advisement for future CEO compensation,"" Aylwin Lewis, chair of the board's compensation committee, said in a statement.
In December, Iger's contract was extended through 2021 when Disney announced plans to acquire film and TV businesses from Twenty-First Century Fox (O:FOXA) in a $52.4 billion deal. 
Under the extension, Iger is eligible for salary and bonuses totaling $48.5 million when the transaction is completed, according to a regulatory filing. 
Lewis said the board had decided it was ""imperative"" for Iger to remain as chairman and CEO to oversee the integration of Fox businesses. Fox also felt Iger's continued leadership was ""essential,"" Lewis said.
""We believe that the terms of Bob‚Äôs extension are in the best interests of our company and our shareholders, and essential to Disney‚Äôs ability to effectively maximize long-term value from this extraordinary acquisition,"" Lewis said.
Iger's compensation declined by 17 percent in fiscal 2017 to $36.3 million. He received a smaller cash bonus due to the ""absence of growth"" in the year that ended Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing.
Shareholders on Thursday also elected 10 members to Disney's board.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 11:50AM ET</span>","Linde, Praxair expect bids for planned divestitures this month: sources","By Arno Schuetze and Foo Yun Chee
FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Gases groups  Linde  (DE:LING) and Praxair (N:PX) are pressing ahead with divestitures to facilitate their planned $85 billion merger and have asked potential buyers to present first-round bids this month, people close to the matter said.
The exact size of asset sales has not yet been finalised in negotiations with antitrust regulators, said Linde Chief Executive Aldo Belloni after the company on Thursday posted a 2.8 percent rise in 2017 operating profit.
But broad lines have become clear: Linde and Praxair are planning to divest assets with about $750-800 million in combined earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, the sources said, adding they expect them to sell at an enterprise value of 10-12 times that. 
Peers such as  Air Liquide  and Air Products trade at 11-12 times their expected core earnings, while Praxair trades at 13.7 times and Linde at 9.5 times. 
Finding buyers for the assets would smoothen the regulatory path to clearance for the merger. It would follow, in a different blockbuster deal, Bayer (DE:BAYGN) agreeing to large divestitures to peer BASF to get an antitrust nod.
The Linde and Praxair assets up for sale are two-thirds based in Europe with the remainder in the United States. Industrial gases are driven to customers usually within a 100 to 250-mile radius of production facilities, and regulators therefore examine regional rather than national markets in their reviews.
In a bid to appeal to regulators and to attract a broad range of suitors, the European assets have been split into two alternative bundles, only one of which would be sold, the sources said.
One package comprises Praxair assets in various parts of Europe, while a second package combines Linde assets in Spain and Portugal as well as some additional European Praxair assets, they added.
Several buyout groups have been working on their bids, based on information packages that Linde and Praxair sent out last month.
CVC, which has tied up with gases group Messer, is expected to bid for all assets on offer, as are Carlyle (O:CG), KKR (N:KKR) and Onex (TO:ONEX), the sources said, adding that some investors were still in talks to tie up with gases groups.
Regulators have in the past blocked divestitures of assets to private equity, citing a lack of industrial clout.
Some large peers, however, face potential antitrust concerns on their own and Linde peers such as Air Liquide (PA:AIRP), Air Products (N:APD) and Taiyo Nippon Sanso (T:4091) are expected to make offers only for individual parts of the portfolio. 
Linde and Praxair have asked for first-round bids to be handed in by the end of March. But people close to the matter said the deadline may be delayed as some bidders have asked for more detailed financial information before submitting bids.
Linde said last month that divestments would be larger than initially planned. However, the company stressed on Thursday that a pain threshold would not be breached. 
The two companies had said last year that either party could walk away or seek to renegotiate the merger agreement if divestitures reach more than 3.7 billion euros in total revenues or 1.1 billion euros in combined core earnings (EBITDA).
Praxair and the potential suitors declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 11:10AM ET</span>",VIX 'fear gauge' seen as incomplete measure of U.S. equities risk,"By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed
BONITA SPRINGS, Fla. (Reuters) - The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's so-called ""fear gauge,"" does not give the full picture of investor sentiment and other measures should be taken into account, speakers at a major derivatives conference said this week.
A record spike in the index recently after years of muted activity has put the VIX back in focus as investors try to gauge the prospect of more wild U.S. stock market swings. 
But there are other indicators and benchmarks that provide a more complete picture of expected risk, these experts said on Wednesday during the Cboe Global Market Inc's (O:CBOE) Risk Management conference in Bonita Springs, Florida.
Treating the VIX as a fear gauge ""can be a bit misleading,"" said Mandy Xu, a derivatives strategist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) who presented at one of the sessions at the conference. 
The VIX estimates the 30-day expected volatility of the benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) based on option prices on the index.
""The demand for puts versus calls, term structure, volatility of volatility, those measures in aggregate give you a fuller picture of market positioning and investor sentiment than just the VIX,"" Xu told Reuters separately.
A four percent drop for the S&P 500 on Feb. 5 resulted in a record spike in the VIX and made it a hot topic for market reports and commentary. But the market watchers with a newfound focus on the VIX may not be looking at the most accurate proxy for investor sentiment. 
""The VIX index reflects what investors are actually paying for protection rather than how they are feeling about risks generally,"" William Speth, global head of research at Cboe Global Markets, said during a presentation
While the VIX may not be as much of a household name as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for ""VIX index"" surged to the highest in at least a decade in February, Google Trends data showed.
(GRAPHIC: Spike in Google search interest in 'VIX index' - http://reut.rs/2FnKcEU) 
Cboe offers other volatility related indicators including the VVIX Index (VVIX) and the SKEW Index (SKEWX), which provide a more complete view of expected risk, Speth said.
""The world of volatility is more nuanced than is just captured in the VIX index,"" he said.
The VVIX index measures the volatility of the 30-day forward price of the VIX index, and is often called the volatility of volatility.
The SKEW is an options-based index tracking the implied volatility of deep out-of-the-money S&P 500 options to measure expectations for very large declines in the index.

The VIX closed at 17.76 on Wednesday, well above its pre-volatility shock close of 13.54 on Jan. 31. But measures like VVIX and SKEW have retreated close to or below their respective pre-shock level, painting a calmer picture of future market movements.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union has proposed making it a formal requirement for asset managers to consider ""sustainability"" when picking investments, a move the EU's 23 trillion euro ($28.5 trillion) funds industry swiftly dismissed as a ""tick-the-box"" exercise.
The EU wants more money going into sustainable and ""green"" projects that help cut greenhouse gas emissions, as part of a wider ""capital markets union"" project to expand funding from financial markets for companies and growth. 
In an ""action plan"" published on Thursday, the European Commission said it would ""clarify"" the duty of asset managers and big investors to ensure they take sustainability into account in the ""process"" of investing.
The European Fund and Asset Management Association said it did not believe such legislation was needed because investment in sustainable projects had to be driven by the owners of the assets being invested.
""Any mandatory sustainability requirement, especially regarding investments, would turn environmental, social and governance into a 'tick the box' compliance exercise,"" EFAMA said.
PensionsEurope, which represents national pensions trade bodies, said the EU's proposals needed to be flexible so as to avoid upsetting the role of trustees or social partners.
""Pension funds' main purpose will continue to be serving the best interests of their members and to delivering adequate pensions at low costs,"" it said. 
The EU's proposal also includes plans for a checklist of what qualifies as a climate friendly and sustainable activities, definitions which could be used for creating EU labels for ""green"" financial products.
The Commission will also look at how banks and insurers could benefit from lower capital charges if they invested in green projects. The Commission has retreated from an initial plan to go ahead with implementing these reductions after opposition from an advisory panel and central bankers who were worried about a green ""bubble"" being created.
Markus Ferber, a member of the European Parliament, which will have final say on the proposals, said the EU should focus on keeping alive the bloc's capital markets project, given that Britain, the EU's biggest market, is leaving.
""What we need is bold initiatives tackling obstacles in tax and insolvency law and measures that facilitate capital market financing by smaller companies,"" Ferber said.
""Sustainable finance, however, is only a diversion from the fact that one of the Commission‚Äôs flagship projects is about to tank,"" he said, referring to slow progress with efforts to create a EU-wide capital market that can provide financing for businesses.

The stock has received a number of upgrades from Wall Street analysts ahead of the expected announcement Thursday afternoon of a  25% tax on imported steel and 10% on imported aluminum.
""U.S. Steel announced Wednesday their intention to restart one of two blast furnaces at their steel making facility in Granite City, Illinois,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) said in a note to clients raising their price target for the stock to $55 from $48 ‚Äî 17% above where the stock opened Thursday.
""In our view, this restart is a strategic move and makes sense regardless of 232 impact, as payback should be rapid and X is already short on volume,"" analyst Curt Woolworth said Wednesday.
The stock has received a slew of upgrades across Wall Street in recent days as the  resignation of White House economic advisor Gary Cohn seemed to leave no further hurdle for the new tariffs, yet Credit Suisse‚Äôs remains one of the most bullish.
BMO Capital Markets analyst David Gagliano gave the stock a $50 price target on Wednesday, and Christopher Olin of Longbow Research raised his target to $63 last week when the tariffs were first announced, according to Bloomberg. Wall Street‚Äôs average target is now $43.87 ‚Äî in line with where the stock was trading Thursday morning. 
""We acknowledge our 2018/19 price deck looks conservative, but we maintain prices given the rapid pace of escalation in today‚Äôs pricing environment,"" said Credit Suisse. ""As fixed costs will largely remain the same, the additional volume should contribute to higher incremental margins.""
US Steel is down 3% Thursday, trading at $44.29 at the time of writing, and up 18% since the beginning of 2018.

""The clock is ticking,"" Christoph Debus, head of the travel group's airline business, told Reuters in an interview at the ITB travel trade fair. ""Brexit is coming in March 2019 and we are already selling tickets for summer 2019.""
British airlines currently have unlimited flying rights to, from and within the European Union as part of an EU's single aviation market. Carriers must be majority EU-owned to exercise those rights.
After Brexit, it is not clear what agreements will govern flying rights between Britain and the remaining EU countries or what Britain's status within the bloc's aviation safety regulator, EASA, will be. 
""I believe that there will be a solution, but the question is how quickly,"" Debus said, saying a two-year transition period in which everything remains according to current rules while details are cleared up would be desirable. 
Earlier this week, the boss of British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG) , Willie Walsh said he was convinced a solution would be found, although Ryanair's (I:RYA) CEO predicted disruption in April 2019.

(Reuters) - Diners at McDonald's (N:MCD) should not be alarmed if they see the restaurant chain's iconic 'M' logo turned upside down on Thursday at different locations across the country. 
For the first time in its history, the company has flipped its 'golden arches' logo to show a 'W' in honor of International Women's Day on Thursday, according to restaurant officials. 
A McDonald's in Lynwood, California, which is owned and operated by a woman, first flipped its 'M' at the sign in front of the restaurant to celebrate women everywhere, the company said in a statement. By Thursday, all of McDonald's social media profiles, including Instagram, Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), were displaying an upside-down logo. 
The move was intended to honor ""the extraordinary accomplishments of women everywhere and especially in our restaurants,"" Wendy Lewis, the company's global chief diversity officer, said in a statement on Tuesday. 
More than 62 percent of McDonald's employees are women, including six out of 10 restaurant managers, Lewis said. 

About 100 restaurants across the country plan to participate in the gesture, and customers will also see the flipped logo on packaging and crew member's hats and shirts, the company said in a statement.

HYDERABAD (Reuters) - Indian airlines Jet Airways (NS:JET), SpiceJet Ltd (BO:SPJT) and AirAsia India are planning to add new jets to their fleets as they look to expand in the world's fastest-growing aviation market, the carriers said on Thursday.
Domestic Indian passenger traffic increased by 17.9 percent in January from a year earlier, marking the 41st consecutive month of double-digit growth, the International Air Transport Association said in a monthly update released on Thursday.
Civil Aviation Secretary Rajiv Nayan Choubey said as long as oil prices remained below $80 per barrel, he expected the Indian aviation market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15 percent for the next 20 years or so. 
""We are committed to ensure that new airports are built, better air space management services are provided, so that there is no congestion in the skies,"" Choubey said at the Wings India airshow.
Indian airlines are scrambling to add more jets to meet demand for more domestic and international flights, making it one of the most targeted sales markets for jet manufacturers Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co  (N:BA).
""The growth of the domestic Indian (aviation) market is the highest in the world,"" Boeing Senior Vice President Asia Pacific and India Sales Dinesh Keskar said. ""Every segment of traffic in and out of India is going to grow for the next 20 years.""
Boeing said in July it expected Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 new aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia's third-largest economy.
Jet Airways hopes to close a deal to buy another 75 narrowbody jets by the end of March, its CEO Vinay Dube told reporters on the sidelines of the airshow. 
The airline last year finalised a deal to buy a separate 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and said it was in ""serious talks"" for 75 more. 
Dube said it would finalize the deal with one of the plane manufacturers, alluding to Boeing or Airbus. 
AirAsia India is looking to expand its fleet to 60 jets from the current 14 over the next five years, a spokeswoman said. The airline's parent, AirAsia Bhd (KL:AIRA), said in January it was considering an IPO of the Indian arm.

Indian low-cost carrier SpiceJet said in July it had signed a provisional deal to buy 40 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets.

LONDON (Reuters) - The chief executive of British retailer Marks & Spencer (L:MKS), Steve Rowe, said he and his new chairman, Archie Norman, differed very little on the strategic direction of the company and were working well together.
Given Norman's impressive track record of turning around struggling retailers, most famously the revival of supermarket chain Asda (N:WMT) in the 1990s, some analysts had feared he could go beyond his non-executive brief of running the M&S board and become a ""back seat driver"" of the business.
However, Rowe said on Thursday the dynamic between the two was ""absolutely brilliant, we're having a ball.""
""When you've got a period of uncertainty in retail like we do today, I genuinely believe that it's good to have another retailer to bounce things off of,"" he told the Retail Week Live conference.
""I think the combination is that one and one equals three,"" he said.
Norman succeeded investment banker Robert Swannell as M&S chairman in September last year.
Two months later M&S re-set its strategy, saying it would speed up store closures and relocations as more trade shifts to the internet and would re-position its food offer.
Norman said M&S had been ""drifting, unfulfilling its customer promise"" for over 15 years, failing to deliver the pace of change required.
Rowe, who became CEO in 2016, is a 28-year M&S lifer.
""We agree on 85 percent of everything we talk about, that's brilliant,"" said Rowe.
""There's 10 percent we don't agree on and we debate it and we get to a solution. And there's 5 percent of stuff we will never agree on. That's really healthy.""
Both have said investors will need to be patient. M&S is forecast to report in May a second straight fall in annual profit.
FRAGILE CONSUMER
On the sidelines of the conference Rowe told Reuters the British consumer was ""fragile"" and ""volatile"".
Britons are spending more on food but cutting back on non-essential purchases as their spending power is squeezed by inflation and subdued wage growth.
More UK retailers are struggling. Last week Toys R Us UK and electricals retailer Maplin collapsed into administration, putting over 5,000 jobs at risk, while  Carpetright  (L:CPRC) and Mothercare (L:MTC) both warned on profit again and said they were talking to lenders.
On Wednesday fashion retailer New Look said it planned to close 60 of its 593 UK stores, threatening 980 jobs, while on Thursday the John Lewis Partnership [JLPL.UL] reported a 22 percent drop in annual profit.
Rowe also told the conference he was ""very pleased"" with initial results from a small online grocery delivery trial launched last year.
""Would our customers like it? Yes they do,"" he said.
But he said some questions remained unanswered and required more work.
""Does it increase the basket (size of sales)? There's some maths in here which is really important if you're going to have a profitable online business. Are we willing to pay for the service? What's the cannibalization (from stores)?""

Kroger, which owns some 2,800 grocery stores under banners such as Ralphs, Harris Teeter, Fred Meyer and Mariano's, forecast 2018 earnings of $1.95 per share to $2.15 per share. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of $2.15 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
""External pressures continue to weigh on the fundamentals -particularly the heightened competition from Walmart, Amazon-Whole Foods, Aldi, Lidl, and others - resulting in ongoing reinvestment in the business, which has been pressuring results,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman said in a client note. 
Kroger also forecast a 1.5 percent to 2 percent rise in sales at existing stores in 2018, compared with the analyst consensus of 1.8 percent. 
The Cincinnati-based company is refining its product assortment, pricing, marketing and customer service under its technology-driven Restock Kroger initiative as it expands convenience with delivery, curbside pickup and self-checkout.
Kroger expects to spend $3 billion on capital investments in 2018, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, the same as 2017 but down from $3.6 million in 2016.
It also is streamlining its business. Last month Kroger sold 800 convenience stores to British gas station operator EG Group for $2.15 billion.
In the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3, sales rose 12.4 percent to $31.03 billion, topping analysts' target of $30.83 billion.
Identical same-store sales were up 1.5 percent, edging past analysts' estimate of 1.45 percent.
Net earnings attributable to Kroger jumped 68.8 percent to $854 million, or 96 cents per share.
Gross margin was 21.9 percent of sales for the fourth quarter. Excluding fuel, the 53rd week and a credit and charge for last-in-first-out inventory accounting, gross margin decreased 31 basis points from the same period last year.

Kroger's shares had gained about 16 percent in the past six months before dropping 11 percent to $23.30 in early trading.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 08:20AM ET</span>",ING CEO's 50 percent pay hike angers Dutch politicians,"By Bart Meijer
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch lender ING (AS:INGA) outraged politicians and unions on Thursday with a proposal to increase the pay of Chief Executive Ralph Hamers by 50 percent.
Finance minister Wopke Hoekstra said the rise was ""excessive"", while members of parliament called for a public hearing to hold ING Chairman Jeroen van der Veer to account.
51-year old Hamers, who has led ING since October 2013, will receive the extra pay in the form of ING shares worth 50 percent of his base salary of 1.75 million euros ($2.17 million). He received a total of almost 2 million euros in 2017. 
Dutch politicians have tried to limit pay for bank executives since the financial crisis, including by limiting performance bonuses to a maximum of 20 percent of base salaries.
Labour union CNV said ING's willingness to pay Hamers 50 percent more is ""absurd"", as the bank is only offering its other employees a general pay rise of 1.7 percent this year.
Van der Veer, a former CEO at Shell (L:RDSa), said Hamers had been underpaid for years. 
""We have postponed this decision time and again, but decided to make a big step now"", he said in an interview with financial daily Het Financieele Dagblad.
Under Hamers ING has made a push into digitalization and increased its net profit to 4.9 billion euros last year from 1.25 billion in 2014.
Its share price has risen 66 percent since Hamers took the reins, compared with a 39 percent overall gain for the Amsterdam blue chip AEX index (AEX).
""Hamers has built a clear track record in the past few years and we want him to continue the transformation of the bank,"" Van der Veer said.
ING spokesman Raymond Vermeulen declined to say whether the timing of the pay rise had anything to do with Hamers receiving job offers from other companies.
ING said the increased pay will rank the bank 44th among Euro Stoxx 50 companies in terms of CEO pay.
Hamers' base salary will be 2 percent higher than last year, and he will be required to hold on to the shares for at least 5 years. He can raise his total pay to 3.05 million euros by meeting certain targets.
Shareholders will vote on the supervisory board's proposal at their annual meeting on April 23.

""It‚Äôs a softer play on the idea than the original 'sky was falling' reaction last week when it sounded like it was going to be across the board, no ifs, ands or buts, and everybody was just going to get hammered,‚Äù he said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 93.85 points, or 0.38 percent, to close at 24,895.21, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 12.17 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,738.97 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 31.30 points, or 0.42 percent, to 7,427.95.
Ahead of the news that trickled out from the White House in the last hour and a half of the trading day, the S&P had zig-zagged in a tight range between positive and negative territory as investors were uncertain about what Trump would say. 
Worries that the tariffs would ignite a global trade war have dominated markets since he announced the tariff plan last Thursday, and the exit of chief economic adviser Gary Cohn late Tuesday intensified the concerns.
But not everybody was pleased with the latest trade news. 
Century Aluminum (O:CENX) shares fell 7.5 percent after the news as it had been seen benefiting from higher prices if the tariffs were put in place. Shares in U.S. Steel Corp (N:X) fell 2.9 percent while AK Steel (N:AKS) closed down 4 percent. 
Michael O‚ÄôRourke,¬†Chief Market Strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut was still concerned about how Trump's policies could affect global trade.
¬†¬†¬† ""He dialed it back a little bit, but they're still tariffs, and we're still going in the wrong direction from a policy perspective if you're a markets-focused globalist. I wouldn't be surprised if he comes out with different tariffs on other things,"" he said. 
The energy index (SPNY) was the only one of the S&P's 11 sectors to end the day lower, with a 0.1 percent drop as oil prices declined. [O/R] 
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.38-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.15-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 26 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 157 new highs and 22 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.38 billion shares, compared to the 7.65 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S.-based fund manager Breakwave Advisors is launching the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) focusing on freight futures, reflecting growing investor interest in shipping as it emerges from a near-decade long crisis, a regulatory filing showed.
Around 90 percent of traded goods by volume are transported by sea and global shipping sectors - such as dry bulk - are on course for a recovery this year, according to investors and analysts, prompting speculators to look for ways to trade.
Freight forward agreements (FFA), which allow investors to take positions on freight rates at a point in the future, are being seen as viable betting instruments.
Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF said in a prospectus filed to the SEC this week that its fund would provide investors with exposure to the daily change in the price of dry bulk FFAs by tracking the performance of a portfolio of nearest calendar derivatives contracts.
ETFs are a popular vehicle for tracking baskets of stocks, futures and derivatives, among other financial instruments, for much lower fees than actively-traded funds.
Sources familiar with matter said the ETF, the first of its kind in shipping futures, was expected to be launched in the coming weeks.
""Freight futures have not been that accessible to most investors out there,"" one of the sources said, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Another of the sources added that the ETF was likely to be of interest to many types investors, particularly hedge funds as they look for other types of exposure to the sector.
Hedge funds are already loading hundreds of millions of dollars into the shipping sector through investments in stocks - putting behind them losses suffered in 2013 when, based on forecasts of improved world economic growth, they piled in to shipping debt and equity.
Elsewhere, the London-run Baltic Exchange wants to make a tradable instrument out of its globally tracked main sea freight index, which gauges the cost of shipping dry bulk commodities including iron ore, grain and coal.
The Baltic is also looking into launching a freight index for LNG (liquefied natural gas), creating further scope for trading plays.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Italy plans to propose to other European Union members that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) resume lending to small- and medium-sized enterprises in Russia, on hold since 2014, the Italian ambassador to Russia said.
The EBRD froze new investments in Russia in 2014 over Moscow's role in the Ukraine crisis. Around 90 percent of the bank's investments in Russia in 2013, prior to the decision, were in the private sector.
Pasquale Terracciano said Italy wants to discuss relations with Russia at the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels next month.
Terracciano told Reuters the EU had agreed that ""we should facilitate, encourage the evolution of Russian civil society and foster contacts and cooperation people-to-people. The Italian position is that civil society must include an economic dimension.""
There are 23 members on the EBRD board of directors, representing the bank's shareholders, who include the United States and Russia. The EU has a majority on the board.
Terracciano said that in 2014 when the EBRD decided to freeze investments in Russia, the bank argued that the distinction between the public and the private sector in Russia ""is blurred"". 
""This is true for the big conglomerates ‚Äì but definitely not true to the SMEs. The inclusion of SMEs was probably a decision taken without considering in detail, the depth of the issue but just taken in the heat of events (in eastern Ukraine),"" he said.
""There was an oversight when the sanctions regime was applied by the EBRD. Now we have an opportunity to correct this.""
Italy is among the EU nations who take a less hardline stance on Russia, arguing that both the western sanctions and Russian counter-sanctions hurt business. The other camp, led by Germany, has taken a tougher line on Moscow.
""There are those (in the EU) who are afraid that any positive movement could be interpreted as if we are softening the sanctions,"" Terracciano said.
""This would not be a reversal of the sanctions system. We are not proposing to abolish or change the sanctions system as there have been no positive developments (in the Ukraine crisis). But we are saying that there is a field which should not fall into the domain of sanctions.""
DISCUSSIONS AT THE EU LEVEL
Set up by governments in 1991 to invest in the ex-communist economies of eastern Europe and owned mainly by developed countries, the EBRD has expanded its mandate in the last decade to now operate in more than 30 countries.
The EBRD still has around a 3 billion euro portfolio of Russian investments. It has recently lost its stake in Promsvyazbank following the central bank's bailout and sold a stake in another Russian lender, Rosevrobank.
Terracciano said preliminary discussions within the EU showed there was ""interest"" in Italy's proposal as ""everybody sees the logic"" to change the EBRD stance, so big firms would still be affected but the sanctions would not target ordinary Russians.
He said there had not yet been discussions with the EBRD board on the proposal to resume lending to SMEs. The EBRD did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.
Terracciano said the discussion at the EU level should happen in April, after which any possible steps could be considered.
""Obviously, we would first have to wait for a discussion at the EU level (in April)... and then see how this reflection can be taken on by the EBRD.""

The investor, one of the world's largest with $2.8 trillion in assets under management, said it plans to begin screening European firms in the STOXX 600 (STOXX) and FTSE 350 (FTLC) that it invests in and engaging with them over diversity.
The move by State Street GA, which said it planned to expand the effort in the future, comes as International Women's Day ratchets up pressure on companies across the world to do more to ensure fair treatment of women on issues including pay.
""Often when we engage with companies on the issue of board diversity we hear that the biggest challenge is a lack of suitable female candidates,"" said Rakhi Kumar, head of ESG Investments and Asset Stewardship for State Street GA.
""Our efforts can't stop at the board level if we truly want companies to adopt policies and practices that will help strengthen gender diversity throughout their organizations, and ultimately contribute to a greater pool of female directors qualified to serve on a board.""
Over the last year, pressure from State Street GA resulted in 152 listed companies, that had previously had no women on their board, move to having at least one, it said. Although 600 other firms it had targeted had yet to act.

1597,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 07:20AM ET</span>",Oil and corn tout dueling studies on future of U.S. biofuel program,"By Ayenat Mersie
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big oil and big corn are touting opposing studies released this week on proposed biofuels policy reforms under consideration by the Trump administration, part of an ongoing clash between the two sides over the future of the program.
 Valero Energy  Corp (N:VLO), a major oil refiner, funded a study by Charles River Associates that supports placing a cap on the price of biofuel blending credits under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) - a change meant to help refiners that complain the RFS now costs them a fortune.
A rival report from Iowa State University, also released this week, said such a cap on credits would backfire by eroding U.S. demand for corn-based ethanol and potentially lowering corn prices, already under pressure from a supply glut. The corn industry did not directly fund the Iowa State study, but does provide funding to the university.
The studies are meant to inform the administration's deliberations on how, and if, to reform the RFS - which has become a major point of tension between two of President Donald Trump's most important constituencies.
The RFS requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels, mainly corn-based ethanol, into the fuel supply each year, or buy the renewable fuel credits, called RINs, from other companies that do the blending.
The regulation was introduced during the administration of President George W. Bush to help farmers, cut petroleum imports, and improve air quality. But a surge in the price of RINs in recent years has upset merchant refiners who say the policy now costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.
Trump waded deeply into the debate last week, urging representatives of both sides to accept a compromise deal that caps prices for the credits while also removing seasonal limits on high-ethanol blend gasolines to expand the biofuels market.
A cap would control costs for small refiners and help them stay afloat, said Brendan Williams, vice president of government relations for refining company PBF Energy (N:PBF). 
The biofuels industry likes the idea of expanding high-ethanol blend gasoline sales, but has pushed back on the idea of a cap. ""The RFS is a well-designed program,"" said Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council. ""Part of the whole mechanism working is that the price of RINs may go up, and so you should go long on biofuels.""
""It‚Äôs a strategy to kill the RFS and to kill the economic incentive to blend,"" said Coleman, referring to a 10-cent cap.
Trump has not pushed a particular price level for the proposed RIN price cap, but Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas - an advocate for the refining industry - has called for a limit of 10 cents per RIN, a fraction of their current value.
The Iowa State study said such a cap would translate to 4.6 percent less ethanol blending in 2018. And without an increase in exports, that would mean a drop in corn prices, too. 
The Valero-funded study, on the other hand, said a price cap ""could alleviate several of the most pressing issues with the RFS"" while also continuing to incentivize investment in ethanol blending.
In January, refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions blamed its bankruptcy on RINs. Bad deals and large investor payouts also played key roles in its collapse, Reuters reported.

On Wednesday, 150 biofuel manufacturers sent an open letter to Trump urging him to protect the program. The letter came as a delegation of refinery workers held meetings with lawmakers urging changes to the RFS.

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 06:21AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Five banks open up trillion dollar gold club,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - The five banks that settle every transaction in London's $6.8 trillion a year gold market are changing the rules of their clearing house to make it easier for newcomers to join. 
The reform is part of a broad overhaul of institutions that underpin the world's largest bullion trading center to make them more transparent after accusations of price manipulation by banks and traders and pressure from regulators. 
As that pressure increased, the number of banks clearing gold transactions through a company they own called the London Precious Metals Clearing Limited (LPMCL) has dwindled from seven to five. They are HSBC, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Scotiabank, UBS, and ICBC Standard.
Several banks have attempted to join the group in recent years. ICBC Standard joined in 2016 after months of wrangling over conditions and an application from at least one other, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), was declined, sources in LPMCL member banks said. 
Spokespeople for HSBC, JPMorgan, Scotiabank, UBS and ICBC Standard declined to comment. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment on whether its application had been turned down.
Opening the company up to new members could help make the market more competitive.
Asked about the changes, Ruth Crowell, Chief Executive of London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), which provides administrative services for LPMCL, told Reuters in an emailed statement that LPMCL had recently been restructured.
""One of the benefits of the new structure has been to make the LPMCL more accessible to new members and to clarify the entry requirements,"" she said. 
The LPMCL member banks have been considering changes to its rules since a review involving outside consultants that began around three years ago found that LPMCL lacked transparency and adequate governance, four sources in LPMCL member banks said.
In September they set up a new LPMCL company to replace the existing company with the same name, according to documents from Companies House, Britain's companies register.
Crowell said the LPMCL ""has recently restructured to reflect the changing corporate and regulatory climate since the Company was incorporated in 2001.""
She said the restructuring ""was designed to improve transparency, access to join and the corporate governance of the LPMCL, as well as to provide additional safeguards to the market in the form of revised rules incorporating the latest anti-bribery and corruption provisions.""
REGULATORY SCRUTINY
Sources at LPMCL banks said a lack of clear requirements for new joiners had meant any member bank could veto an application.
""You can't have three or four banks making up reasons why people can't join. We spent a lot of time with lawyers making sure it stood up to regulatory scrutiny,"" said one of the sources.
The new LPMCL company has a new charter and a list of requirements for applicants, including connection to the LPMCL's Aurum clearing platform and access to a precious metals vault in London, which if completed would guarantee entry, the sources said. 
The company also has a new category for non-shareholding members who would pay a subscription to participate. 
""Membership can now be categorized into User Members and Equity Members,"" said Crowell.
The member banks were signing the final papers to complete the reform process, the sources said.
""They needed to make sure it was a fairer, open organization,"" said a bullion market source familiar with the restructuring process. 
""They had to do it because they are scared they'll find themselves on the end of an anti-trust collusion lawsuit."" 
IMAGE PROBLEM
Tighter regulation since the financial crisis a decade ago and allegations that several bullion banks manipulated gold and silver prices have forced London's gold market to open up to scrutiny and modernize its key infrastructure.
Gold, silver, platinum and palladium price benchmarks set in the city and used by buyers and sellers worldwide have been taken out of the hands of banks to be run as electronic auctions by exchange operators. 
The LBMA has also revealed how much gold is stored in vaults in the city -- 7,841 tonnes as of November last year -- and is collecting data to show for the first time precisely how much gold is traded each year.
Until now the only statistics on the London market have been estimates of turnover by LPMCL, which says gold worth $26 billion traded on average each trading day in London last year. 
LPMCL was set up in 2001 to develop an electronic matching system to replace trading by phone or fax between bullion banks. It is not a traditional clearing house, which acts as an intermediary to guarantee and settle trades, but a network of bilateral trading and credit agreements between its member banks.
In 2016 ICBC Standard became the first new member since 2005. Goldman Sachs was rebuffed, two sources at LPMCL banks said. Goldman was told it would not receive the necessary credit lines for it to participate, one of these sources said.
Without new members the club has shrunk.  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) left in 2001, Rothschilds in 2004,  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in 2015 and  Barclays  (LON:BARC) in 2016, all after closing their precious metals operations in London. 
And even with the new reforms the barriers to entry are high.
""It's not easy to join. You have to have a lot of capital and a major wholesale business or it's going to take you years to build up and you have to be able to absorb those costs until you do so,"" said one source at an LPMCL bank. 
Sources said membership could fall further because increasing regulation meant clearing was becoming less profitable. 
Scotiabank said in February it would restructure and shrink its metals unit. A spokeswoman for Scotiabank declined to comment on whether it would stay a member of LPMCL.
Although fewer members could give those left a larger slice of the business, they are keen to expand the club because it makes it look more transparent and competitive. 

""Having only three or four members doesn't look good,"" said one of the sources.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 03:24PM ET</span>",Health insurer Cigna to buy Express Scripts for about $52 billion,"By Caroline Humer and Ankur Banerjee
(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer  Cigna Corp  (N:CI) struck a $52-billion deal to buy pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) Express Scripts Holding Co (O:ESRX) on Thursday, looking for new ways to hold onto their profits as the industry faces greater scrutiny for rising healthcare costs.
The pharmacy benefits business, which tries to negotiate down the price of prescription medicines for large employers, has drawn fire from the Trump administration and Congress, who have questioned whether those discounts are really being passed on to consumers.
Cigna's deal follows close on the heels of a rival $69-billion merger between CVS Health Corp (N:CVS) and health insurer  Aetna Inc  (N:AET), announced in December. Together, the transactions would represent a massive consolidation of the market for managing employees' prescription drug benefits, prompting some experts to question whether they will be approved.
""Employers are growing increasingly frustrated with the cost of prescription drugs and a lack of transparency into the economics of how this works,"" said Jim Winkler, senior vice president for health at benefits manager and broker Aon, part of Aon Plc (N:AON).
Cigna and Express Scripts say the combination will lower costs for corporate clients by giving them more coordination between medical care and pharmacy benefits, particularly for pricey specialty drugs.
""Our employer clients will be delighted with that,‚Äù Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in an interview.
It could help Cigna more closely manage how costly drugs are prescribed and delivered to patients, and fend off potential competition from new players such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
All told, the companies project $600 million in annual savings. 
Express Scripts shares were up 8 percent at $79.29 on Thursday afternoon, but they were trading 12.6 percent below the current value of the bid, suggesting that some investors see difficulties closing the deal.
Cigna shares fell 11.5 percent to $171.86.
DEALS IN TANDEM
PBMs administer prescription drug programs for health insurers, self-insured companies and government agencies, negotiating deals with drug manufacturers, working with pharmacies and processing claims. 
The largest U.S. health insurer, UnitedHealth Group (N:UNH), in 2015 expanded its in-house pharmacy benefits business, OptumRx, with the $13-billion purchase of Catamaran. CVS, Express Scripts and UnitedHealth control more than two-thirds of the PBM market, a top U.S. health official said on Wednesday. 
Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) in October said it would expand its own pharmacy benefits business, and hired CVS to do so. 
Antitrust experts said the Trump administration would need to review how both deals between Cigna and Express and between CVS and Aetna would affect the U.S. market, already the world's most expensive healthcare system. 
""Having two simultaneous deals significantly raises the risk,"" said David Balto, an antitrust lawyer with expertise in the health industry. ""There's a significant risk that both deals get challenged.""
In 2016, the Obama administration scuttled two major health insurer mergers - Anthem Inc's purchase of Cigna and Aetna's purchase of rival Humana (NYSE:HUM) - largely on concerns the consolidation would raise costs for consumers.
Today's deals between an insurer and PBM represents a so-called vertical integration of players within the health industry. But it could limit the ability of large employers to choose who manages both prescription drug benefits and medical coverage for their employees.
""This type of merger would create a market-straddling giant, with new profit-maximizing incentives ... ultimately leading to higher costs and potentially poorer coverage and care for consumers,"" said George Slover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports.
Most national companies with more than 20,000 employees use different companies to provide prescription drug benefits and medical coverage. Express Scripts CEO Tim Wentworth said during a conference call with analysts that he does not expect to lose other health insurers who use Express Scripts as their PBM because of the deal.
THE OFFER
Cigna's offer consists of $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 in shares of the combined company for each Express Scripts share, amounting to $96.03 per share. That represents a premium of nearly 31 percent to Express Scripts' Wednesday closing price.
Cigna will also assume about $15 billion in Express Scripts' debt, the company said.
The combined company will be led by current Cigna CEO Cordani. Wentworth will stay on as president of the company's Express Scripts unit.
After the deal closes, expected by the end of the year, Cigna shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company and Express Scripts shareholders the rest.
Cigna intends to fund the cash portion of the deal through a combination of cash on hand, Express Scripts debt and new debt issuance. The combined company is expected to have debt of about $41.1 billion.
The insurer said it obtained fully committed debt financing from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) Senior Funding and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd for the deal.

Morgan Stanley was the financial adviser to Cigna. Centerview Partners and Lazard were financial advisers to Express Scripts.

1602,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 06:00AM ET</span>",Germany looks to revise social media law as Europe watches,"By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) - A German law requiring social media companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter to quickly remove hate speech from their sites is set to be revised following criticism that too much online content is being blocked, according to officials.
The law, which came into full force on Jan. 1, is the most ambitious effort by a Western democracy to control what appears on social media. It aims to ensure Germany's tough prohibitions against hate speech, including pro-Nazi ideology, are¬†enforced online by requiring sites to remove banned content within 24 hours or face fines of up to 50 million euros ($62 million).
The law, called NetzDG for short, is an international test case and how it plays out is being closely watched by other countries considering similar measures. 
German politicians forming a new government told Reuters they want to add an amendment to help web users get incorrectly deleted material restored online. 
The lawmakers are also pushing for social media firms to set up an independent body to review and respond to reports of offensive content from the public, rather than the individual companies doing that themselves. 
Such a system, similar to how video games are policed in Germany, could allow a more considered approach to complex decisions about whether to block content, legal experts say.
The proposed changes follow widespread criticism from opponents of the law, including free speech campaigners and the Association of German Journalists, who say the threat of hefty fines is prompting internet firms to err on the side of caution and block more content than is necessary. 
They point to several high-profile cases, including when a satirical magazine's Twitter account was blocked after it parodied anti-Muslim comments.
Facebook, which says it has 1,200 people in Germany working on reviewing posts out of 14,000 globally responsible for moderating content and account security, said it was ""not pursuing a strategy to delete more than necessary"".
""People think deleting illegal content is easy but it's not,"" said Richard Allan, Facebook's vice president for EMEA public policy. ""Facebook reviews every NetzDG report carefully and with legal expertise, where appropriate. When our legal experts advise us, we follow their assessment so we can meet our obligations under the law.""
Twitter declined to comment on how it is implementing the law, while Google's YouTube said it would continue to invest heavily in staff and technology to comply with NetzDG.
Among other countries considering similar measures, France is looking at rules to block ""fake news"", Britain is seeking to stop online harassment of politicians and Japan is looking to restrict suicidal posts after a suspected serial killer found his victims by trawling Twitter. 
FREE EXPRESSION
Lawmakers from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats and the left-leaning Social Democrats - parties poised to renew a governing coalition - are formulating changes to NetzDG.
""We will add a provision so that users have a legal possibility to have unjustly deleted content restored,"" said Johannes Ferchner, spokesman on justice and consumer protection for the Social Democrats and one of the architects of the law. 
He did not elaborate on how such a mechanism might work. At present, there is no formal mechanism for people to get content restored, beyond complaining to the social media firm involved.
Thomas Jarzombek, a Christian Democrat who helped refine the law, said the separate body to review complaints should be established, adding that social media companies were deleting too much online content. 
NetzDG already allows for such a self-regulatory body, but companies have chosen to go their own way instead. According to the coalition agreement, both parties want to ""develop"" the law to encourage the establishment of such a body.
Germany's opposition Free Democrats (FDP), who believe the decision over whether content should be removed should be in the hands of the courts rather than companies, said the proposed changes would not make a big difference. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†""Private companies are deciding what is right and what is wrong and therefore limiting free expression,"" said FDP digital expert Jimmy Schulz. ""The law should be scrapped in its current form as there is nothing that can be solved by amendments.""
German authorities have stressed, however, that they believe the law is working well in terms of forcing social media companies to delete offensive posts. 
The Federal Office of Justice, which is responsible for administering the new law, said it had received 205 online complaints about sites failing to delete offensive posts in January and February, far fewer than expected. Officials had predicted 25,000 complaints a year.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 09:05AM ET</span>",StanChart factors planned U.S. trade tariffs into lending,"By Emma Rumney and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed trade tariffs are already influencing lending decisions by Britain's  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) and could have an impact on its profitability, its Chief Financial Officer told Reuters. 
The Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused bank has been taking into consideration the effect Trump's plan to hike duties on steel to 25 percent and on aluminum to 10 percent could have on loans to sectors that might be hit, Andy Halford said.
""I think it would be remiss of us not to be factoring it into lending decisions. But what it exactly is obviously will need a little bit of thought,"" he said in an interview.
Trump is this week expected to sign a presidential proclamation to establish the tariffs, which he says will stop cheap imports from countries like China hitting U.S. industry and jobs. 
His proposals sparked retaliatory threats from China and Europe and fears of a global trade war, rattling markets and groups like Standard Chartered that have bet big on free trade. 
StanChart Chief Executive Bill Winters on Thursday said that there are some signs that such a war could be avoided as the U.S. softens its stance.
""The good news is, from what we saw yesterday, the U.S. is beginning to moderate its stance on steel and aluminum, and if things stay relatively moderate to some of the fears, there won‚Äôt be a big impact at all,‚Äù Winters said on the sidelines of the Saudi-UK CEO forum in London. 
The bank is more focused on trade and commodities than many of its global peers, and it is trying to boost its business with U.S. customers who trade with emerging markets. Stanchart makes 80 percent of its profits in Asia.
TIT FOR TAT 
The bank tested the impact of a severe world trade downturn triggered by rising protectionism in its 2017 stress test, an indication of how important trade flows are for its bottom line.
Halford said it was business as usual for a large part of the bank, as the majority of its clients were not affected. But if protectionism spread beyond the U.S. or Americas it will have to extend the review of the risks it poses.
""If there ends up being a sort of tit-for-tat and other sectors are brought into it then we'll extend the review.""
The tariffs could also impact the speed at which StanChart is able to reach its new profit target, Halford said.
StanChart last month unveiled a new medium-term goal of an 8 percent return on equity, as it recovers from a restructuring that saw the key profitability metric fall into the negative.
While it has not announced the timetable for achieving the goal, Halford said analysts predicting the bank should get there by 2021 if it grows at its current pace are not wrong.
""If this U.S. protectionist rhetoric does take hold, then maybe it could be a little bit longer,"" he said.

The bank last year posted a return on equity of 3.5 percent, up from 0.3 percent. Halford said revenue growth, income from rising global interest rates and a reduction in Britain's bank levy should all contribute to it hitting the 8 percent goal.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China Resources Beer in talks to acquire Heineken's China business - sources,"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China Resources Beer (Holdings) Co Ltd is in talks to acquire Heineken NV‚Äôs China business in a deal that could be worth more than $1 billion, as the country's largest brewer seeks new growth from premium brands, five people close to the discussions said. 
The negotiations come as global beer giants such as Heineken, AB InBev (ABI.BR) and Carlsberg (CO:CARLa) (CARLb.CO) are facing fierce competition from local rivals and each other in emerging markets, which have been touted as the growth engine for the world's biggest brewers. 
(For a graphic on 'Global beer market interactive' click http://tmsnrt.rs/2xMlHgE) 
China is the world's largest beer market by volume. CR Beer's biggest brand, Snow, is the world's top-selling beer, but is almost exclusively sold in China. 
One of the sources said the deal between CR Beer and Heineken would most likely include three breweries - in Guangdong, Hainan and Zhejiang provinces - Heineken's distribution operation and its brands in China.
The two brewers have discussed a share-swap as part of the transaction, the source said.
Details have not been finalised and talks could yet fall apart, the sources said. They declined to be identified as the information is not public. 
CR Beer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Heineken declined to comment.
Heineken, which entered China in 1983, has struggled to set up a strong distribution network and to make a mark with its flagship Heineken lager, which lags far behind AB InBev's Budweiser in the premium market, industry analysts say. 
The Dutch brewer had a 0.5 percent share of the China market by volume in 2016, according to research firm Euromonitor International, while CR Beer accounted for more than a quarter.
Heineken sells its premium lagers Heineken, Tiger and Sol in China, along with cheaper local brands Anchor and Hainan Beer.
The company has invested millions of dollars in promoting Heineken as the global lager of choice, predominantly through sports, including soccer and Formula One. Next month will mark its second time as prime sponsor of the Chinese Grand Prix.
Beer sales volume in China has been declining since 2013 and is forecast to continue to fall, according to Euromonitor. Sales of higher-margin premium beers, however, have been growing at a double-digit rate each year during the same period. 
""CR Beer doesn‚Äôt have super-premium lagers, while Heineken has high-end brands but lacks scale in China,"" said one source. ""Heineken is a natural target for CR Beer.""
Heineken's eponymous brand sells for three times the price of Snow in China. Chinese beer drinkers are overwhelmingly consumers of low-margin inexpensive beer, which makes up 80 percent of the market by volume, compared with an average of 18 percent in big developed markets, according to Nomura analysts. 
Last year Japan's Asahi Group Holdings sold its 19.9 percent stake in Tsingtao Brewery Co - CR Beer's biggest domestic rival - for $937 million as it decided to focus on Europe and elsewhere in Asia.
CR Beer's interest in Heineken's China unit follows its takeover in 2016 of SABMiller's 49 percent stake in its CR Snow venture for $1.6 billion.
That acquisition helped the Chinese brewer turn around its business. In 2016 it reported its first annual profit in three years after a renewed focus on the Snow brand and expanded sales in key Chinese cities.
Shares of CR Beer were trading at HK$30.85 on Thursday in Hong Kong giving the group a market capitalization of about HK$100 billion ($12.76 billion). Heineken shares were at 85.78 euros ($106.36) in early trade, valuing the group at 49.4 billion euros.
Heineken trades on an enterprise value - market capitalization plus debt - of 12 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization in the last year. That is above Carlsberg's multiple of 10 but far short of CR Beer's 23.

1607,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 05:20AM ET</span>",Forbes keeps Saudis off billionaires list after corruption purge,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Forbes magazine said on Thursday it was excluding all Saudi Arabian tycoons from its annual list of the world's richest people after dozens of top businessmen from the oil-rich kingdom were detained in a crackdown on corruption last year.
Most detainees were released after reaching settlements with the authorities, who say they arranged to seize more than $100 billion in assets through such deals. But the government has provided few details about who was netted in the sweep, what they were accused of and how much they gave up.
Forbes said earlier in the week that it was ""impossible to know definitively who gave how much to whom when"".
The magazine said it had removed the 10 Saudi billionaires who made the cut last year, including detained in the crackdown like Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, with wealth previously valued at $18.7 billion, and Mohammed al-Amoudi whose treasure stood at $8.1 billion.
""With greater clarity regarding their wealth, some might eventually return to the ranking,"" Forbes said.
The magazine's Middle East edition said in a separate statement on Thursday that the wealth of Saudi billionaires was believed to have increased from $42.1 billion last year due to the rise in oil prices and capital markets globally, but would be excluded due to the reported asset seizures.
Alwaleed, who told Reuters in an interview hours before his release in January that he did not expect to give up any assets to the government, sued Forbes in 2013 alleging the magazine had undervalued his wealth.
The magazine listed 2,208 billionaires worldwide in 2018, up from 2,043 in 2017.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German unit of European missiles maker MBDA and U.S. arms company  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) have formed a joint venture to press ahead with a new air and missile defense system being negotiated with the German military, they said on Thursday.
The 60-40 MBDA-led venture will serve as prime contractor for the new multibillion-dollar TLVS system, which the two companies have been negotiating to get under contract with the German defense ministry since 2015. It is aimed at replacing the Patriot air defense system fielded in the 1980s.
Dietmar Thelen, the top MBDA executive in the venture, said its formation was the next natural step for the long-time business partners. He said the move did not mean a contract was imminent but the two sides were making progress.
""We're getting closer every day,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.
The German defense minister announced in 2015 that it had chosen the Medium Extended Air Defence System (MEADS) -- developed with $4 billion in funding from Germany, Italy and the United States -- over Raytheon Co's (N:RTN) Patriot system.
However, the two sides have been struggling to work out the details and terms of the program ever since.
Discussions between the companies and the government were complicated by new procurement guidelines aimed at increasing the transparency of the process and reducing the risk of technical delays and cost overruns endemic on new projects.
Government sources said the initial proposal submitted by MBDA, which is jointly owned by Airbus Group (PA:AIR), Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF), also lacked the required detail and specificity. 
Gregory Kee, who will lead the venture from the Lockheed side, said the ministry's procurement arm was expecting a single prime contractor to deliver the new weapons system.
""This formal registration of the joint venture is intended to provide that capability to act as a single prime contractor to ensure that our German customer receives the most advanced system in the world,"" he said.
Both executives declined to forecast when the contract could be finalised.
""We continue to support the process and are responding to the government‚Äôs requirements. We respect that process. Until that process is complete, we can't talk about the price or the timetable,"" Kee said.
The TLVS program was initially slated to cost about 4 billion euros ($4.96 billion), but sources familiar with the proposal say the final cost is likely to be several billion euros higher.
The MEADS system was developed jointly by Germany, Italy and the United States, though the U.S. Army later decided not to buy the system for its own use.

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 04:56AM ET</span>",Norway's wealth fund may expand emissions blacklist to more companies,"By Gwladys Fouche
OSLO (Reuters) - The ethics watchdog for Norway's $1-trillion sovereign wealth may blacklist more companies that produce too much greenhouse gas by scrutinizing more industry sectors, including shipping and power.
Carbon emissions became a criteria for exclusion from the fund in 2016 and last year the watchdog recommended that ""a small handful"" of firms be excluded from the fund for producing too much greenhouse gas emissions in either the oil, cement and steel industries.
Those recommendations are currently under review with the board of the central bank, which oversees the fund, and a public announcement is expected soon, the bank's governor told Reuters on Feb. 27. 
Johan H. Andresen, chair of the fund's publicly appointed Council on Ethics, said the watchdog would look at more firms in the energy, steel and concrete industries and add more sectors, including shipping and power producers.
Speaking in an interview ahead of publication of the council's annual report on Thursday, he said: ""I expect there will be more companies recommended for exclusions based on the climate criteria.""
""Shipping and power producers are among the sectors we may be looking at.""
The world's largest sovereign wealth fund was created from the proceeds of Norway's oil industry and operates under ethical guidelines set by parliament.
It owns shares in 9,100 companies, 1.4 percent of the world's listed equity, so its decisions to drop or reinstate companies from its investments carry considerable weight among investors.
Andresen said a company that is a big emitter of climate gases must show what plans it has to cut emissions by 2030 to remain in the fund's portfolio, revealing for the first time what factors the watchdog takes into account. 
""If they are very big emitters of greenhouse gas on an aggregate level and they are 'worst in class', they will really have to move,"" said the 56-year-old Norwegian, who also owns private investment vehicle Ferd. 
""They will need to have very credible plans to reduce emissions, that they have said they are going to do, not only to us, but to their shareholders.""
The fund itself has proposed dropping oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index which, if accepted, would mean the fund would cut stakes in oil and gas companies over time.
The proposal is currently under review at Norway's finance ministry and will be voted on by parliament at a later date. Even if it goes ahead, the ethics watchdog will still have plenty of high polluters to examine.
""It would reduce the number of suspects we are looking at, but I don't think we will be out of work,"" said Andresen. He declined to name specific companies. 
CORRUPTION WATCH LIST
The fund has also been looking at blacklisting companies because of corruption risks. One is Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) which is on a watch list for possible exclusion in the future if the ethics watchdog deems there is a risk of corruption.
In January, state-controlled Petrobras agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. class action corruption lawsuit.
The fund held a 0.68 percent stake in Petrobras worth $436 million at end-2017, according to fund data. 
Andresen said that while there were parts of Petrobras that were trying to change their practice to a more sustainable one, an ""inherent challenge"" was the practice of changing Petrobras' board members whenever a new government came to power. 
""It is going to take some time for state-controlled companies to understand that they must adhere to these compliance practices which minority shareholders, or other shareholders, expect and which is the basis for which they are listed,"" he said.
The watchdog has an ongoing evaluation under the watch list scheme, he said. ""We will just have to decide what kind of risk that entails and whether it makes it (Petrobras) more or less likely to be engaged in gross corruption in the future.""
HUMAN RIGHTS
The fund's ethics procedure was launched at the start of the millennium and 73 companies are presently excluded on recommendations by the Council on Ethics, on various grounds.
Another 69 companies are excluded directly by the central bank based on their dependence on thermal coal.
The fund gradually sells shares in any company it wishes to drop, before any announcement is made. The main aim is to remove the ethical risk.
The fund is forbidden by law from investing in companies that produce nuclear weapons or landmines, or are involved in human rights violations, among other criteria. 
This year, Andresen said the ethics panel would definitely make a recommendation for exclusion due to the risk of corruption and was working actively on recommending exclusions regarding human rights violations in the textile industry in Asia.

He also anticipated there could be more recommendations against shipping companies for the practice of ""beaching"" -- running old vessels aground to be picked apart by manual labor. The fund excluded four shippers on these grounds in January.

In a letter to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), one of the lead agencies probing the alleged loan fraud, the jeweler said the seizure of his assets, bank accounts and the shutting down of all his offices in India has caused prejudice against him.
The March 7 dated letter, which was reviewed by Reuters, said investigating agencies were acting with a pre-determined mind and interfering with the course of justice.
In what has been dubbed the biggest fraud in India's banking history, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and police have accused two jewelry groups - one controlled by diamond tycoon Nirav Modi and the other by his uncle Choksi - of colluding with some bank employees to secure credit from overseas banks using fraudulent guarantees.
Both Choksi and Modi have denied the allegations and lawyers for the two key accused PNB employees in the case have also said they are innocent. The authorities have said Choksi and Modi left India before the complaint against them was filed and their whereabouts are unknown.

A spokesman for the CBI was not immediately reachable for comment on Choksi's claims.

El-Erian,"(Bloomberg View) -- The monthly U.S. jobs report is among the most eagerly awaited data releases, and for good reasons. It provides a snapshot of the underlying health of the economy that also speaks to political, social and institutional well-being.
The numbers for February, which will be released Friday, could also shed light on the speed and orderliness of important ongoing transitions in the economy, markets and policy.
Viewed in most economic terms, the data contained in the jobs report highlight both supply and demand issues.
The evolution of unemployment and underemployment, as well as the labor participation rate, feed directly into assessments of the economy‚Äôs production capacity and its ‚Äúsafe‚Äù speed, or the sweet spot between ‚Äúoverheating‚Äù and ‚Äúslack.‚Äù Details of employment conditions of different segments of the population are inputs for assessments of the structural evolution of the economy. And, on the demand side, jobs and wage growth are significant contributors to consumption, which is the major driver of economic activity.
As economic conditions often are an important factor in election results, all these variables also have political implications. Add to this the social insights offered by the evolution of the monthly data on employment by race, age and education level.
As it turns out, at this specific economic moment in time, the report can also help assess the prospects for three medium-term transitions:
All three evolutions are vital to longer-term economic well-being and financial stability. And while they all have been gaining traction, they‚Äôre also navigating market uncertainties about global trade relations and economic policy management. 
Here are the kinds of numbers for February and subsequent months that would increase the probability of successful, orderly and timely transitions:
Such a mix of indicators would not only enhance the health of the labor market, improve production capacity, counter concerns about debt burdens, and help to ensure that the benefits of growth and economic prosperity are more widely shared. They would also facilitate further progress on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs ‚Äúbeautiful normalization‚Äù of monetary policy while supporting financial asset prices with stronger economic fundamentals.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Southeast Asia's biggest ride-hailing firm, Grab, is in advanced negotiations to buy parts of Uber Technologies Inc's business in the region, said a source with knowledge of the talks, in what would be Uber's second retreat from an Asian market.
Ride-hailing firms have raised billions of dollars to help compete in Southeast Asia where they have been forced into losses partly due to hefty incentives to drivers and discounts to riders.
Grab has a dominant position in several markets in the region of about 640 million people, while Uber has also been expanding. The U.S. ride hailing firm announced a partnership with Singapore's top taxi operator ComfortDelgro in December.
""Grab is much bigger in Southeast Asia and they understand the local market much better,"" said Xiaofeng Wang, analyst at consultancy Forrester.
A multi-billion dollar funding of Uber in January by SoftBank Group, already one of Grab's main investors, had opened up the possibility of a consolidation with Grab.
""Uber has to be more focused on those markets where it is doing quite well and have more advantages - like Europe and U.S.,"" Wang said.
Singapore-headquartered Grab's potential agreement with Uber would be similar to the one struck in China in 2016, when Didi Chuxing bought out Uber's China business and gave a stake in return, said the source, who declined to be identified as the talks are private.
As part of the Southeast Asia deal, Uber will get a stake in Grab, said the source, who declined to provide financial details.
Grab declined to comment on the Reuters story while Uber did not respond to Reuters' queries.
Though Uber expects to lose money in Southeast Asia, the company will continue to invest aggressively in the region, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said during a visit to India last month.
Grab operates private car, motorcycle, taxi and carpooling services across eight countries with more than 2.3 million drivers. It has expanded into digital payment services.
The company, which has an estimated valuation of about $6 billion, counts sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corp, venture capital firm GGV Capital, and Vertex Ventures, a subsidiary of Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings, among its investors.

Bloomberg reported on Thursday that Grab was close to finalizing a deal to acquire Uber's business in certain markets in Southeast Asia and may sign a deal this week or next, citing people familiar with the matter.

1620,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 02:50AM ET</span>",Tepco's 'ice wall' fails to freeze Fukushima's toxic water buildup,"By Aaron Sheldrick and Malcolm Foster
OKUMA, Japan (Reuters) - A costly ""ice wall"" is failing to keep groundwater from seeping into the stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, data from operator Tokyo Electric Power Co shows, preventing it from removing radioactive melted fuel at the site seven years after the disaster.
When the ice wall was announced in 2013, Tepco (T:9501) assured skeptics that it would limit the flow of groundwater into the plant's basements, where it mixes with highly radioactive debris from the site's reactors, to ""nearly nothing.""
However, since the ice wall became fully operational at the end of August, an average of 141 metric tonnes a day of water has seeped into the reactor and turbine areas, more than the average of 132 metric tonnes a day during the prior nine months, a Reuters analysis of the Tepco data showed.
The groundwater seepage has delayed Tepco's clean-up at the site and may undermine the entire decommissioning process for the plant, which was battered by a tsunami seven years ago this Sunday. Waves knocked out power and triggered meltdowns at three of the site's six reactors that spewed radiation, forcing 160,000 residents to flee, many of whom have not returned to this once-fertile coast.
Though called an ice wall, Tepco has attempted to create something more like a frozen soil barrier. 
Using 34.5 billion yen ($324 million) in public funds, Tepco sunk about 1,500 tubes filled with brine to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) in a 1.5-kilometre (1-mile) perimeter around four of the plant's reactors. It then cools the brine to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit).
The aim is to freeze the soil into a solid mass that blocks groundwater flowing from the hills west of the plant to the coast. 
However, the continuing seepage has created vast amounts of toxic water that Tepco must pump out, decontaminate and store in tanks at Fukushima that now number 1,000, holding 1 million tonnes. It says it will run out of space by early 2021.
""I believe the ice wall was 'oversold' in that it would solve all the release and storage concerns,"" said Dale Klein, the former chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the head of an external committee advising Tepco on safety issues.
""The hydrology of the Fukushima site is very complicated and thus the exact water flow is hard to predict,"" he said, ""especially during heavy rains.""
(For a graphic on 'Water Seepage Flows at Fukushima' click http://reut.rs/2FseHpb)
TYPHOON
The water inflows often fluctuate with rainfall. The dry month of January averaged 83 tons a day, Tepco data showed. 
But when a typhoon struck during the last week of October, 866 tons a day poured into the reactors. 
Overall, Tepco says a combination of drains, pumps and the ice wall has cut water flows by three-quarters, from 490 tons a day during the December 2015 to February 2016 period to an average of 110 tons a day for December 2017 to February 2018.
It is hard to measure exactly how much the ice wall is contributing, Tepco officials say, but based on computer analysis the utility estimates the barrier is reducing water flows by about 95 tonnes a day compared to two years ago, before the barrier was operating.
""Our assessment is that the ice wall has been effective,"" said Naohiro Masuda, Tepco's chief decommissioning officer, adding that rain falling within the ice wall perimeter contributed to surging volumes. ‚ÄúWe now believe we have a system in place to manage the water level.""
However, a government-commissioned panel on Wednesday offered a mixed assessment of the ice wall, saying it was partially effective but more steps were needed.
Controlling the groundwater seepage using the ice wall has been central to Japan's program to show it had the Fukushima decommissioning in hand.
The barrier was announced just days before Tokyo won the bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared that Fukushima was ""under control"" in his final pitch to the International Olympic Committee.
In addition to the building costs, the ice wall needs an estimated 44 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year to run, enough to power about 15,000 typical Japanese homes.
(For a graphic on Fukushima's ""ice wall"" click http://tmsnrt.rs/2tqxK1k)
NO MORE SPACE
Meanwhile, Tepco must decide how to cope with the growing volume of water stored on site. 
The purification process removes 62 radioactive elements from the contaminated water but it leaves tritium, a mildly radioactive element that is difficult to separate from water. Not considered harmful in low doses, tritium is released into oceans and rivers by nuclear plants around the world at various national standard levels.
But local residents, particularly fishermen, oppose ocean releases because they fear it will keep consumers from buying Fukushima products. Many countries, including South Korea and China, still have restrictions on produce from Fukushima and neighboring areas.
A government-commissioned task force is examining five options for disposing of the tritium-laced water, including ocean releases, though no decision has been made.
Ken Buesseler, a radiochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the United States, suggests that Tepco should open the tanks to external inspections to see if the water is safe.
""From the public's viewpoint, I think they'd want a bit of independent confirmation,"" Buesseler said. ""It's no harder and a lot cheaper than building an ice wall.""

1622,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 02:31AM ET</span>",Malaysia says EU palm oil curbs could weigh on France in fighter jet deal,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia, the world's No.2 producer of palm oil, on Thursday said the European Union's decision to curb imports of the commodity could impact France's hopes of winning one of Asia's biggest fighter jet deals.
France's Rafale jet, built by Dassault Aviation (PA:AVMD), had until recently been seen as the frontrunner in Malaysia's plan to buy up to 18 new fighter planes in a deal potentially worth over $2 billion, but negotiations hit a snag after European lawmakers pushed to stop using palm oil in motor fuels.
Malaysia said earlier this week that it would not shy away from a trade war and that it would respond with ""might and tact"" if the EU does not back down on curbing palm imports.
""As you know, the jet fighters the French are looking at, the Rafale, are also competing with the Brits who have left the EU. So they have to take that into consideration (in relation to palm oil curbs),"" Malaysia's defense minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said at a news conference outside parliament. 
Britain's BAE Systems (L:BAES) has been on a consistent and public campaign for nearly a decade now to win the Malaysia contract, even establishing a regional office in the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
Hishammuddin's latest statement raises hopes for BAE, which looked to be on the backfoot after Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that he had discussed the possible purchase of Rafale fighters with Francois Hollande during the then-French president's visit in March last year.
Both Dassault and BAE did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Southeast Asia's third-largest economy could lose some $500 million in annual revenue if the EU goes ahead with its plan to crimp palm imports, analysts have estimated.
The move also adds to the troubles of Prime Minister Najib, whose ruling coalition will rely heavily on the votes of over 600,000 palm oil plantation smallholders and their families in national polls that must be held by August.
Hishammuddin said Malaysia ""cannot put a price tag"" on the interests of the country and its people when negotiating bilateral deals.
""So (to) those who want to have strong bilateral relations with us, do not just look at economic considerations separate from other considerations, especially when it come to defense because we do have other options,"" he said.
Malaysia has for several years been weighing France's Rafale jet and the Eurofighter Typhoon, built by a European consortium including BAE, as it looks to replace its Russian MiG-29s - most of which are grounded.

However, a decision has been delayed due to the upcoming national polls and a shift in Malaysia's focus toward upgrading aerial surveillance capabilities.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese retailers are cashing in on International Women's Day, offering coupons and discounts on sportswear, cosmetics and healthcare to get women to spend more, dubbing the day ""Queens' Day"" and ""Goddesses' Day"".
Across the globe, women are hosting workshops, protests and dinner parties to celebrate the women's rights movement and press for progress on gender equality. 
But in China, the day was dominated by sales campaigns from online retailers, a trend that has angered women's rights activists who want to reclaim the day as an opportunity to make progress on issues like combating sexual harassment.
One gym pushed memberships by saying ""it only takes three months to become a queen"", while  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) encouraged shoppers to ""give life to your women-power"".
The women-targeted market, or the so-called ""she economy"", a term coined by China's education ministry in 2007, is expected to account for $700 billion by 2019, according to the Chinese securities firm Guotai Junan.
""If you look at how companies are thinking about their ad spending, how they think about product selection, probably they are thinking, 70 to 75 percent of our spending really needs to be targeted directly at women,"" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group. 
Women spent 64 percent more in 2017 than in 2015, with a majority of purchases made in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, according to a report by Alibaba, which controls the largest share of retail e-commerce sales in China. 
Purchases were more than cosmetics and shoes. 
The number of women who bought running outfits rose over 13 times in the last 12 months, while spending on boxing gloves by women soared 75 percent, according to a separate Alibaba report.
Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment on criticism by women's rights activists on the focus on Women's Day sales by retailers.
The drive by Chinese companies is not only focused on consumer goods.
To entice increasingly health-conscious women, Alibaba is this year for the first time collaborating with private hospitals to offer around 50 percent off vaccines for human papilloma virus (HPV), the sexually transmitted disease.
""NOT TALKING ABOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS'?
Despite women's growing importance to China's economy, they still lack equality of opportunity in business and politics, according to women's rights activists.
Chinese women earn 22 percent less than men per month, with the gap being wider in higher level positions, which are more often occupied by men, the Chinese jobs website Zhaopin said in a report. Only a quarter of Chinese lawmakers are women.¬†¬†
""The mainstream of Chinese society has not talked about real women's rights issues on International Women's Day for a long time,"" said Xiao Meili, a well-known feminist activist.
""They don't even dare use the three words 'funujie',"" she said, referring to the original name of ""Women's Day"" in China, which has connotations of working women. 
""They always say 'Queen's Day' or 'Goddess Day', as if this is the day when everyday women finally have the chance to be doted on. It's just consumerist feminism,"" added Xiao. 
Instead of shopping, Chinese women should take action to combat sexual harassment as part of a Chinese #MeToo-style movement, the Beijing-based Feminist Voices group, said on the popular Chinese social media app WeChat.
Chinese students, professors and women's rights activists have been calling for more to be done to stamp out sexual harassment on college campuses, after a viral public accusation of sexual harassment was made by a graduate of Beijing's Beihang University against her former professor.

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 01:43AM ET</span>","With Venezuelan hyperinflation, multinationals buck price controls","By Tibisay Romero and Corina Pons
VALENCIA, Venezuela/CARACAS (Reuters) - When Colgate-Palmolive Co's (N:CL) Venezuelan unit in January raised the price of laundry detergent to keep up with inflation that hit 85 percent the month before, it drew a swift rebuke from the government of President Nicolas Maduro, which demanded a nearly 90 percent price cut. 
Price control agency Sundde ordered a reduction of the price of a one-liter container of Vel Rosa detergent to the equivalent of $0.16 from $1.40, according to union leaders and company employees.
In response, Colgate shut the plant that produces it, according to a Feb. 2 letter to Sundde seen by Reuters, saying that operations would be unsustainable on those terms.
When it resumed production a week later after a meeting with Sundde, the results were precisely the opposite of what authorities had sought: Colgate had halved its standard container size for Vel Rosa and was selling it for the equivalent of $0.83, the sources said - effectively raising the price by 19 percent. 
The incident highlights how multinational companies in Venezuela have become more aggressive in pushing back against the socialist government's demands that they sell goods at below production costs as the country struggles under hyperinflation and deepening recession.
Similar pricing disputes since the start of the year have involved companies including Nestle (S:NESN) and Mexican bottler and retailer Femsa (MX:KOFL), according to company employees, as Maduro seeks to stem annual inflation that has unofficially topped 4,000 percent. 
The disputes threaten to worsen long-running tensions between the government and the multinationals, and illustrate the difficulty of maintaining a presence in Venezuela in the hopes of a big rebound under a future government. 
Thousands of companies across the country have slowed production and at least 20 percent have stopped operating for lack of raw materials or customers, according to the most recent survey by industry association Conindustria.
Foreign companies, betting on the possibility of an eventual recovery, are maintaining minimal operations with skeleton workforces that in some cases show up only to eat at company cafeterias.
Colgate and Sundde did not respond to requests for comment.
'SLASH PRICES'
Venezuela's price controls have created tensions with foreign companies since their 2003 introduction by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, but in those days most disputes were resolved quietly through discrete price increases to compensate for inflation.
Maduro, facing uncontrolled inflation, began the year by ordering supermarkets to roll prices back to December levels, a demand reinforced by Sundde inspectors.
Around the same time, Nestle (S:NESN) announced that its plant that produces a snack known as compote - pureed fruit such as apple, pear or peach mixed with cereal - stopped operating for lack of raw materials. 
Union leaders say Nestle has chosen not to import raw materials because it is under orders to sell compote for a quarter of what it had typically fetched in supermarkets.
The plant remains closed. 
""Nestle Venezuela always complies with local laws, and is respecting the pricing regulations in all our operations,"" Nestle wrote in statement in response to questions. ""We are determined to maintain our operations in the country and to continue to support the local communities where we operate.""
Mexico's Femsa, which bottles and distributes Coca-Cola in Venezuela, was ordered by Sundde to stop increasing soft drink prices - even though they have not been historically covered by price controls, according to two union members who asked not to be identified.
""The company would not accept regulations on the price of soft drinks,"" said one of the sources. ""They said they would shut down if the prices were regulated.""
Femsa instead agreed to stop increasing the price of bottled water, which is covered by price regulations, while it continues to raise soft drink prices, the sources said.

Femsa did not respond to a request for comment.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 12:40AM ET</span>",CLSA eyes Southeast Asia push with $10 billion Manila airport project,"By Jennifer Hughes and Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - CLSA, the offshore platform of Chinese investment bank CITIC Securities (SS:600030), is working on the finance for a new $10 billion airport in Manila as part of its push into Southeast Asia and China's ambitious Belt and Road initiative.
In an interview this week, CLSA chairman Tang Zhenyi told Reuters that CLSA also planned to open new offices in Vietnam, Pakistan and Dubai this year as the Asia-focused broker continued its expansion into investment banking.
Introduced in 2013, the Belt and Road project is aimed at building a modern-day economic ""Silk Road"", connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa.
Beijing has called on financial firms to develop overseas lending businesses to help connect China with old and new trading partners including the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). 
The Manila airport project, to be developed south of the Philippine capital, is still awaiting government approval but CLSA has held preliminary talks with potential Chinese backers for the deal, Tang said.
""It looks like we are in good shape to do this. It's a $10 billion minimum project,"" he said. "" Citic  and CLSA are in the perfect position to talk with all the Chinese financial institutions.""
Tang and CLSA did not give the location or further details of the project. Local media have reported competing airport proposals are currently being studied by the Philippines government. 
The involvement in the airport project by CLSA, which was bought by CITIC Securities in 2013, comes at a time it is aggressively expanding its investment banking advisory services beyond its broking origins, by leveraging its China ties.
""China has the capital, (it) has the market. These countries have the need,"" he said, referring to the ASEAN countries' push to boost infrastructure investments. 
Tang, who worked for China's Ministry of Finance and for the World Bank in Washington before joining Citic Group in 2011, became chairman of CLSA in November 2016. 
Last year, the company returned to its CLSA branding, dropping the name Citic CLSA, although it does operate as the international arm of CITIC Securities. 
As part of its strategy to grab a bigger share of investment banking deals in Asia, CLSA is also in talks with Pakistan's ministry of finance to help the country sell Panda bonds - debt sold by foreign entities to investors in mainland China.
Tang said CLSA is in the middle of a transformation, and plans to add up to 15 bankers in Southeast Asia this year as it seeks to diversify from its Chinese roots. Of its 120 current bankers, about 80 are involved with China-related projects and 40 with ASEAN business. 

""We are hoping by adding more ASEAN content into the whole company, we will see it more 50-50 (between ASEAN and China)"".

""This assessment is based on known risks and predicted impacts associated with airworthiness certifications and slower than expected flight test execution,"" the Air Force said in a statement on Tuesday.
The potential delays will not result in additional program cost to the taxpayer, the statement said. 
Boeing previously missed a forecast that the aircraft would be delivered last year.
In a statement on Wednesday, Boeing said: ""There is always risk on any development program, we‚Äôre relying on our partnership with the Air Force to help mitigate those risks, complete KC-46 testing and deliver 18 game-changing tankers to them as quickly as possible."" 
The world's biggest maker of jetliners said it had discussed a range of delivery dates with the Air Force.
In the third quarter of 2017, the company took a $329 million charge for its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program. Charges related to the program have reduced profit by $1.9 billion after tax.

Boeing expects to build a substantial business from the tanker, which is based on its twin-aisle 767 commercial jet. Boeing plans to deliver 179 tankers to the U.S. Air Force and expects to sell about 400 in total worldwide.

LONDON (Reuters) - A sense of calm returned to global markets on Thursday, as traders took a break from worrying about a global trade war and focused instead on the European Central Bank's plans to end its 2.5 trillion euro stimulus program.
European (EU) U.S. and Asian share markets all edged up - the first two for a fourth day - after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested he may spare some key trade partners in his push to introduce protectionist tariffs.
The euro lingered in the red though, as a bigger-than-expected drop in German industrial orders and then a subdued ECB inflation forecast added to the weekend's inconclusive Italian election, reinforcing caution.
The central bank did however drop an explicit promise on its bond buying, which has been running for three years, and there was some pointed criticism from ECB chief Mario Draghi for Trump's plans for more trade tariffs.
""If you put tariffs against (those) who are your allies, one wonders who the enemies are,"" he said.
Wall Street opened higher just after Draghi spoke and the dollar was up marginally too. Trump is expected to sign a document to establish steel and aluminum tariffs by 3:30 p.m. eastern U.S. time, a source told Reuters. 
""This is just the beginning from a U.S. sector perspective as far as protectionism goes,"" said Michael Luckman, a partner a law firm Gowling WLG.
""Import tariffs could be applied to almost anything that a government believes will harm domestic producers, so this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg."" 
Highlighting the strength of the global economy, Chinese data showed both exports and imports rose more than 20 percent in the first two months of this year from a year earlier.
In the currency market, the dollar stabilized against other major currencies after its hit from fears about the tariff plan, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar recovered from steep losses. [/FRX]
The euro traded down at $1.2377, having risen to $1.2447 on Wednesday, its highest since Feb. 16. The currency has been rising since it hit a seven-week low of $1.2154 when Trump unveiled his tariff plan last week.
Bond markets were also steady with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields stuck at 2.87 percent and Germany's benchmark barely budged at 0.67 percent having hit a five-week low of 0.60 percent on Monday.
""The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases,"" it said in it post-meeting statement.
TRADE OFF
In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had risen 1.0 percent, while in Japan the Nikkei gained 0.5 percent.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng led the region with rise of 1.4 percent after China's surprisingly strong trade data. 
Wall Street started with a 0.2-0.3 percent rise for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones which had both seen a choppy day on Wednesday. 
They had swung higher when White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the impending hefty U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports may exclude Canada, Mexico and some other countries.
That soothed worries about the prospect of more aggressive trade measures after the departure of Trump's top economic adviser Gary Cohn. 
Masahiro Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management said the issue would hang over markets however. ""Investors need to see exactly what steps Trump will take and what retaliatory actions other countries will take in coming days.""
EMERGING CONCERNS
Draghi wasn't the only one in Europe to express concerns about Trump's plans. European Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Europe was preparing immediate counter-measures in case of a trade skirmish.
""If Donald Trump puts in place the measures this evening, we have a whole arsenal at our disposal with which to respond,"" Moscovici told BFM TV on Thursday.
The dollar traded at 106.17 yen, little changed in Europe, keeping some distance from its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday.
There was plenty to navigate in emerging markets, too. Turkish assets largely shrugged off Moody's cutting its credit rating deeper into junk-rated territory.
Poland's zloty touched a three-month low against the euro a day after its central bank governor said its first rate increase might come a year later than previously expected.
The Mexican peso hovered cautiously at 18.71 per dollar, bouncing back from Wednesday's low of 18.90 while the Canadian dollar changed hands at C$1.2890 off an eight-month low of C$1.3002 hit this week.
Bitcoin steadied after slumping more than 7 percent on Wednesday after U.S. and Japanese regulators tried to tighten their grip on crypto-currencies.
Japan's financial regulator punished seven crypto-currency exchanges, suspending business at two of them, to bolster consumer protection after the $530 million theft of digital money from Tokyo-based Coincheck. 
In commodities, oil prices inched back after falling more than 2 percent the previous day on record U.S. crude production and rising inventories.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were just under $61 a barrel, down 0.3 percent, while benchmark Brent was 0.5 percent lower at $64 a barrel. 

Key industrial metals were weak. Copper and Nickel hit one-month lows on lingering fears of a trade war.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2018 09:56AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon.com readies move to sell electronics directly in Brazil - sources,"By Gabriela Mello
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) met in Brazil last week with an array of manufacturers to discuss plans to stock and sell products from consumer electronics to perfume in the country, according to two people that took part in the meetings.
The move would take the U.S. e-commerce giant beyond its current role in Brazil as a marketplace for third-party sellers, representing a major advance into the biggest retail market in Latin America. 
Amazon representatives in Brazil declined to comment on the talks, adding that the company had held ""hundreds of meetings with potential vendors and suppliers about its business in Brazil and possible future plans"" in the past five years.
Amazon has waded slowly into Brazil's complex and highly competitive online retail market, starting with e-book sales in 2012, adding physical books two years later and offering third-party sales of electronics in October.
Yet the company appears to be accelerating its expansion this year as the Brazilian economy exits a painful recession, stiffening competition for local rivals such as Mercado Libre Inc, B2w Cia Digital, Via Varejo SA and Magazine Luiza SA.
Shares of Magazine Luiza fell 2 percent in Thursday trading and Via Vareja dropped nearly 3 percent. B2W, which reported a quarterly loss and a change of chief executives on Wednesday, tumbled 10 percent, while the benchmark Bovespa stock index was little changed.
Last month, the same stocks suffered when Reuters reported that Amazon was looking to lease a large warehouse just outside of Sao Paulo.
E-commerce accounts for around 5 percent of Brazil's roughly $300 billion retail market ‚Äî about half its share in the United States ‚Äî but has doubled in the past four years and is forecast to keep growing annually at a double-digit pace.
Amazon representatives, including senior executive Ticiana M√°rtyres, told several dozen potential suppliers gathered at the Hotel Blue Tree Morumbi last week that the company planned to use its own transportation and call centers in Brazil, according to one of the sources. 
""They said they were going to buy directly from the manufacturers and resell,"" said the person, who requested anonymity due to the confidential terms of the talks.

Amazon said it would store goods at its facilities in Greater Sao Paulo, the source added.

1642,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 04:31PM ET</span>",The Fed Isn't Scared of Inflation or a Trade War: Karl W. Smith,"(Bloomberg View) -- Fed Governor Lael Brainard gave a speech Tuesday night entitled, ""Navigating Monetary Policy as Headwinds Shift to Tailwinds."" She noted that the U.S. economy was beginning to benefit from major tailwinds. Federal budget cuts, which had previously subtracted from growth, were replaced by tax cuts that add to it. Growth in Europe and Asia was picking up and with that would come more demand for U.S. exports.
That same evening, Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, resigned after failing to dissuade President Donald Trump from imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum. The resignation was widely seen as bolstering the fortunes of protectionists in the White House such as trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.
Markets opened lower around the world on the news. The Dow was off 300 points as I type this at midday on Wednesday. Commodities were lower and interest rates declined. All signs pointed to rising fears of global trade wars and new headwinds that would slow growth.
Fortunately, the heart of Brainard‚Äôs guidance was general enough to be useful no matter what happens. Wall Street is used to viewing a positive economic outlook from U.S. Federal Reserve officials as a sign that interest rates will soon be rising. Indeed, I think many people mistakenly perceived that to be the message of Chairman Jerome Powell‚Äôs initial testimony before Congress last week.
The Fed is trying to communicate something more subtle, however, and Brainard‚Äôs speech was a good example. The Fed‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation, the core price index for personal consumption expenditures, has been running well below target since the 2008 recession. Despite this, the Fed has begun a campaign of slowly raising interest rates.
Fed officials have defended these moves by noting that the low readings on inflation were driven primarily by transitory factors that they expect to diminish over time. Consequently, market participants should not expect the Fed to give up its long term plans simply because inflation was unexpectedly and temporarily low.
In the past, I and a lot of other commentators interpreted this view as an indication that Fed officials were most intent on controlling inflation. By that thinking, the mere specter of inflation rising above the Fed's 2 percent target would be enough for them to raise interest rates to cool growth.
Brainard‚Äôs speech was the clearest repudiation of this view so far:
Although experience in other countries suggests it can prove difficult to raise an underlying inflation trend that has been running below policymakers' target for several years, stronger tailwinds may help re-anchor inflation expectations at the symmetric 2 percent objective. Of course, it is conceivable we could see a mild, temporary overshoot of the inflation target over the medium term. If such a mild, temporary overshoot were to occur, it would likely be consistent with the symmetry of the FOMC's target and could help nudge underlying inflation back to our target.
In other words, 2 percent inflation shouldn't be thought of an an upper limit, just a rough target. Overshooting it would be consistent with the Fed's goals. Not only that, she goes on to hint that the Fed might actually like to see an overshoot:
Recent research has highlighted the downside risks to inflation and to longer-run inflation expectations that are posed by the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, and it suggests the importance of ensuring underlying inflation does not slip below target in today's new normal.
That's an argument that the conventional view that 2 percent inflation is an upper limit is not only incorrect, but dangerous.
My takeaway is that markets should not interpret talk of a strong economy as a signal that the Fed is necessarily going to raise interest rates. As long as the Fed views the inflationary effects as transitory, as the stimulus from the recent tax cut is likely to be, a steady-as-she-goes approach is the Fed‚Äôs baseline response.
What then to make of a potential trade war? Apply the same logic: If higher tariffs are a temporary policy that is likely to be reversed as the president renegotiates trade agreements, then we should expect the Fed to stand pat, even if that means absorbing a short-term hit to growth.
On the other hand, if what we are seeing is really a shift in U.S. trade policy, then the Fed is likely to take that into account and seek to offset some of the loss of growth. Which would mean a slower rise in interest rates.

1645,By Investing.com,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 04:15PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch,"Investing.com - Here‚Äôs a preview of the top 3 things that could rock markets tomorrow
1. ECB To Hint At Policy Shift?
The European Central Bank delivers its interest decision on monetary policy on Thursday at 07:45 a.m. ET and is widely expected to leave its interest, marginal lending and deposit facility rates unchanged at 0%, 0.25% and -0.4%, respectively.
The ECB‚Äôs monetary policy decision will be accompanying by an appearance from ECB president Mario Draghi in a press conference at 08:30ET.
Draghi‚Äôs comments are likely to monitored closely amid expectations the ECB president could confirm a gradual shift toward a less dovish stance in the central banks‚Äô policy outlook.
Analysts at Rabobank downplayed the impact on the single currency of a change in forward guidance, however, as the market has priced in expectations that the ECB will unwind its stimulus programme later this year.
‚ÄúAny adjustment to the forward guidance will have a minimal impact given the market has already accepted the fact that the program will be wound down between end-September and December this year,‚Äù said strategist Matthew Cairns.
EUR/USD rose 0.06% to $1.2412.
2. US Dollar To Extend Sluggish Run?
While the dollar bounced off its lows late in the session Wednesday, sentiment on the greenback remained mostly negative despite reports suggesting that the Trump may exempt Canada and Mexico from tariffs on steel and aluminium.
Labor market and consumer confidence data Thursday could turn sentiment on the greenback positive ahead of the all-important nonfarm payrolls data due Friday.
The Labor department releases its weekly count of the  number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the week ended March 2, expected to show an increase to 220,000 from 210,000 the prior week. Continuing jobless claims are expected to have increased to 1.921 million for the week ended March 2 from 1.931 million.
The Bloomberg Consumer Confidence Index ‚Äì which measures views on the condition of the U.S. economy, personal finances and the buying climate ‚Äì will also be monitored after falling to a reading of 56.2 last week.
3. China Wholesale, Consumer Data In Focus
China releases February consumer and producer price inflation on Thursday. The reports are expected to show that consumer prices rose by an annualized 2.5% in February from 1.5% the previous month. While producer prices are forecast to show a decline of 3.8% on a year-over-year basis.
In the PBOC‚Äôs most recent quarterly monetary policy report released in February, the central bank said rising commodity prices and base effects raises the possibility of a faster pace of inflation.
Commodities such as gold are highly sensitive to Chinese economic data as the Asian nation is the largest consumer of commodities."
1646,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 04:01PM ET</span>",U.S. senators call new hearing on Takata auto air bag inflators,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senators will convene a previously undisclosed hearing to focus on the status of Takata air bag inflator recalls, the largest, most complex recall process in auto history that some lawmakers say is too slow.
March 20 is the tentative hearing date for the U.S. Senate Commerce subcommittee that oversees the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), committee officials said.
Takata said in June that it has recalled, or expected to recall, about 125 million vehicles worldwide by 2019, including more than 60 million in the United States in vehicles built by 19 automakers.
At least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries worldwide are linked to the Takata inflators that can explode with excessive force, unleashing metal shrapnel inside cars and trucks. The defect led Takata to file for bankruptcy protection in June.
Under the bankruptcy plan, Takata is selling its non-air bag inflator businesses to Key Safety Systems, a unit of China's Ningo Joyson Electric Corp.
The office of Senator Jerry Moran, the Republican who chairs the subcommittee, said that the hearing would examine the ""current manufacturer recall completion rates, the Takata bankruptcy and transition to new ownership under Key Safety Systems, and what all stakeholders including NHTSA are doing to ensure this process continues to move forward.""
A spokesman for Takata did not immediately comment on Wednesday.
Senator Bill Nelson, the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, said in a statement he hopes ""we'll finally get a real plan to improve the still woeful recall completion rates.""
Nelson said ""NHTSA, the independent monitor, and the automakers should all be asked to participate so we can get the numbers moving in the right direction."" Nelson asked 19 automakers in a letter on Feb. 27 to disclose details on the pace of fixing vehicles.
NHTSA says just over half of the 40 million inflators recalled to date have been replaced.
Takata pleaded guilty in 2017 single felony count of wire fraud to resolve a U.S. Justice Department investigation and agreed to a $1 billion settlement. The company is under the oversight of an independent monitor for three years.

Last month, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co warned an additional 33,000 owners of older pickup trucks to stop driving them until Takata inflators can be replaced after a second death in a 2006 Ford Ranger caused by a defective Takata inflator was reported. The other 20 deaths have occurred in Honda Motor Co vehicles.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are scooping up U.S. small cap stocks as the specter of steel and aluminum tariffs escalating into a global trade war makes them more edgy about larger companies exposed to international markets.
The resignation of Gary Cohn, a top economic adviser to President Donald Trump who was seen a key voice pushing against protectionism measures, set off the latest bout of market volatility on Wednesday tied to fears of the tariffs.
Since Feb. 28, the day before Trump said he would impose import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, the small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) has climbed 4.1 percent while the S&P 500 (SPX), the benchmark for large-cap stocks, has risen 0.5 percent.
On Wednesday, while the S&P 500 edged lower in a rocky session following Cohn's departure, the Russell gained 0.8 percent. 
Small cap stocks are ""domestic by nature; they're not selling internationally,"" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""That they're insulated makes them potentially one group that will benefit on a relative basis.""
The small-cap trade echoed the months after Trump's November 2016 election, when the Russell soundly beat the S&P 500 as investors bet on policies, such as corporate tax cuts, that would particularly benefit domestically-focused companies.
In 2017 overall, however, the Russell's 13 percent gain lagged the 19.4 percent climb for the S&P 500, and the small-cap barometer had underperformed this year, until Trump's tariff announcement last week.
""Somebody that's buying a U.S. small cap company that makes all its products in the U.S. is probably comfortable,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. ""You don't have a global situation there.""
The S&P 500 derives about half its profits from outside the United States, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. 
Even so, he said, ""there's merits in why you'd want to be diversified across small and large cap.""
The Russell's outperformance ""could easily dissipate if the bluntness of this trade policy is taken out,"" Luschini said. ""You could get reversion pretty quickly.""
While small caps appear to have benefited from the tariff talk, shares of companies that stand to see their costs rise have suffered.
The S&P 1500 machinery index <.SPCOMMAC> has fallen more than 1 percent since last week while the S&P 1500 automobiles and components index <.SPCOMAU> has shed over 2 percent.
By contrast, the S&P 1500 steel index <.SPCOMSTEEL> has climbed 5 percent in the past few days. (For a graphic of how stock indexes have reacted since Trump started talking about tariffs on aluminum and steel, see: http://reut.rs/2FkGUST)
Some investors stayed away from recommending any significant shifts in portfolio strategies based on the tariffs, as uncertainty remained about their extent and timing with a formal announcement still to come.
‚ÄúWe are not spending a lot of time trying to handicap industries or sectors just because we think there are too many moving parts,"" said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York.
The risk from the tariffs themselves may be limited if there are no repercussions. 
""Unless you have a 1950s portfolio of automakers, steelmakers and producers, you will probably not see much impact if you see the tariffs applied as they are being discussed,"" said Jason Ware, chief investment officer with Albion Financial Group in Salt Lake City, Utah. ""However, the big question is where does it go?"" 
Despite Cohn's exit, some investors may be holding out hope the tariffs will fail to come to pass amid resistance from Republican lawmakers and other countries.
Trump looked set to authorize the tariffs this week as he stepped up pressure against China to develop a plan to reduce its trade imbalance with the United States by a billion dollars. However, stocks pared losses after the White House said late Wednesday that Canada and Mexico, and possibly other countries, may be exempted from the tariffs.
Indeed, an escalation into a trade war could reduce future growth expectations and equity valuations, according to UBS equity strategists, with investors saying the full risks of the tariffs had yet to be priced into the market.
The potential for tariffs also fed into concerns about rising inflation, one of the factors that set off the market's recent 10 percent correction.
Even as stocks bounced back from that slide, they have found renewed volatility after months of relative calm, with the tariff developments and Cohn's departure the latest news to spark swings and lead investors to question whether the decline is over.
The stock market tested major support levels ""a few days ago and it was a good test: Half of the gains were wiped out and it bounced from there,"" said Alan Lancz, president of investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates in Toledo, Ohio. ""We‚Äôre going to experience that again today and tomorrow. We‚Äôll see what happens.""

1652,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 04:17PM ET</span>",Brazil Senate approves Open Skies air deal with United States,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Senate on Wednesday approved an Open Skies agreement between Brazil and the United States that clears the way for a partnership between  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and LATAM Airlines Group SA (SN:LTM).
The treaty will be sent to President Michel Temer, who is expected to sign it into law. The agreement allows an unlimited number of flights between Brazil and the United States, the favorite destination of Brazilian tourists, and should result in lower airfare prices.
It is expected to lead to increased interest by the U.S. airline industry in the potentially huge Brazilian market.
The Open Skies treaty was signed in 2011 but faced opposition from lawmakers lobbied by local airline interests in Brazil, who feared competition from U.S. carriers.
The accord was a requirement for the U.S. Department of Transportation to approve a business deal between American Airlines and LATAM, the two largest carriers in the region, which would see them co-ordinating schedules and offering more connections.
Brazil's anti-trust agency has already given the green light for the partnership. In 2016, Chile-headquartered LATAM signed the joint business agreement with American, and another with IAG's (L:ICAG) British Airways and Iberia, all members of the Oneworld Alliance. 
American Airlines applauded the treaty's approval.
""Open Skies agreements have proven to increase travel choices and enhance competition, resulting in greater benefits for consumers and positively impacting economic growth,"" the airline said in a statement.
Brazil's third-biggest airline, Azul Linhas A√©reas (N:AZUL), which started in 2008, initially opposed the agreement, arguing that it needed to establish itself in the Brazilian market before it was opened up to further competition.
The treaty was backed by GOL Linhas A√©reas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4), Brazil's second airline in which Delta Airlines Inc (N:DAL) has a 9.48 percent stake, and Avianca Brasil, which hopes to seal a business deal with United Continental Holdings Inc (N:UAL) in the near future.
Brazil's center-right government is backing separate legislation to remove or ease limits on foreign investment in Brazilian airlines, currently restricted to 20 percent of common voting shares.
Flights between Brazil and the United States are expected to surge by 30 percent as a result of Open Skies, according to Brazil's tourism board Embratur.

The number of Americans traveling to Brazil has also increased 70 percent since Brazil introduced an electronic visa system in January, according to preliminary data gathered by the Brazilian government.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 03:19PM ET</span>",U.S. investors wanting out of gun stocks find it's not so easy,"By David Randall and Laila Kearney
NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the three weeks since America's deadliest high school took the lives of 17 students and teachers, companies such as Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE:DAL) and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc have cut ties with gun-rights groups or restricted sales of weapons.
National outrage over the Feb. 14 massacre in Parkland, Florida, and protests by social media-savvy student activists and survivors of the mass shooting, sparked hope that a tipping point had been reached in America's long-running debate over gun safety.
But investors trying to send an anti-gun message are discovering challenges, as a number of U.S. mutual fund companies and public pension plans show little desire to move away from their passive investments in popular index funds that carry firearms-related stocks, analysts and plan administrators told Reuters.
""At the end of the day investors are going to have a limited influence because there's only so much companies will do to change their business model,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at New York based CFRA.
More than $11.7 trillion in assets is invested in funds that track passive indexes, according to S&P Capital, leaving gunmaker stocks a staple in many American's retirement funds.
Among funds that focus on small companies, meanwhile, $2 out of every $3 invested has exposure to gun stocks, according to fund-tracker Morningstar. 
BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager with more than $6 trillion in assets, said it planned to grill gunmakers and retailers on how well they monitor firearm sales and use, oversight that gun safety advocates welcomed. BlackRock said on Friday that it was exploring new index-based portfolios that would exclude gunmakers and retailers. 
Yet Rosenbluth said investors have been slow to walk away from funds that include gunmakers. 
""People are going into indexes because they want broad, well-diversified products that are representative of the marketplace,"" he said.
Many so-called socially responsible investors who already routinely exclude gunmakers from their portfolios, are now making a different kind of statement, said Jennifer Sireklove, director of responsible investing at Seattle-based investment management firm Parametric, which oversees $200 billion in assets.
They are buying shares of retailers that have announced restrictions on gun purchases, such as Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, and plan to vote on future shareholder resolutions that shape what type of weapons a company stocks.
The ability to help shape a company's strategy ""all depends on whether you are an owner. If you omit that, then you forgo your ability to influence,"" she said. 
PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS 
Soon after the Parkland bloodletting, activists and legislators pressed public employee funds to shed gun stocks.
""It's our money and I think we should be part of the conversation about where the money goes,"" Broward Teachers Union President Anna Fusco told Reuters. ""We definitely don't want to breed and grow the gun problem that's happening with these assault rifles.""
In New Jersey, lawmakers introduced legislation to block public pension fund investments in any gunmaker. And the State of Michigan Retirement Systems (SMRS) dropped $2 million of chemical and ammunition maker Olin Corp shares from its $70 billion portfolio, Ron Leix, spokesman with the Michigan Department of Treasury, said in an email. 
""The amount was very insignificant and we wanted to focus on meaningful investments that benefit the members of the SMRS,"" Leix said.
Most U.S. funds with holdings in gun companies have shown little immediate indication they would change their investment models to exclude firearms companies, however.
Officials with Florida's State Board of Administration, which manages the state‚Äôs $160 billion retirement fund for teachers and other public employees, said its equity holdings were invested in broad indexes, making it expensive to single out gun stocks for divestment.
In Washington, the Republican-controlled Congress has effectively blocked meaningful gun legislation, although 66 percent of U.S. voters support stricter gun laws, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Feb. 20. The powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) group has long lobbied for no restrictions to the constitutional right to bear arms.
Gun rights advocates doubt the renewed push for gun control after the Parkland shooting will have substantial impact on the firearms industry. Background checks for firearm purchases, an indicator of sales, rose in February to approximately 2.3 million, a 14.9 percent jump from the month before, according to the FBI.

""People have been riding the demise of the firearms industry for many years, and the firearms industry is doing quite well,"" said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president for government and public affairs for the ‚ÄéNational Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade group representing gun and ammunition companies. ""We've seen this before.""

1654,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 05:14PM ET</span>","GM plans to expand Bolt EV output, asks Congress to help","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) Chief Executive Mary Barra called on the U.S. Congress on Wednesday to expand a consumer tax credit for electric vehicles as the automaker said it would boost production of its EV Chevrolet Bolt in response to strong demand.
Barra also called on U.S. regulators to take into account when scoring automakers' emissions the potential for autonomous ridesharing vehicles to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and petroleum consumption. The Trump administration is reviewing whether Obama administration emissions standards that called for roughly doubling average U.S. vehicle fuel efficiency by 2025 are appropriate.
""We feel tax credits should be expanded so our customers continue to receive the benefit going forward,"" Barra told an energy conference in Houston. ""We believe in an all-electric future.""
GM has sold more than 160,000 plug-in and full-electric vehicles eligible for the credit. The $7,500 consumer tax credit phases out over a 12-month-period soon after an automaker hits the 200,000 mark and the largest U.S. automaker is expected to hit the mark later this year. The tax credit is aimed at helping defray the cost of pricier electric vehicles.
Introduced in October 2016, the Bolt was the first mass-produced electric vehicle to go more than 200 miles (320 km) between charges, and sell at a sticker price of under $40,000.
Electrically powered vehicles account for a just a fraction of GM's overall sales. In 2017, an analyst estimated GM loses $7,400 on every Bolt it sells. GM does not disclose individual vehicle profitability, company spokesman Pat Morrissey said by phone.
GM sold about 26,000 Bolt EVs worldwide last year, mostly in the United States. The company declined to say how much it would hike production when it adds production later this year at an assembly plant north of Detroit.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) said last month it expected to reach the 200,000 figure later this year.
Congress opted not to kill the tax credit as part of a tax overhaul passed in December, but did not act on a proposal that would have lifted the cap entirely but then sunset the credit in a few years. 
GM said in October it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023, but did not provide more specifics. Automakers around the world are investing tens of billions collectively to electrify vehicles.
Automakers want the Trump administration to revise the 2022 through 2025 fuel efficiency standards. The administration must determine by April 1 whether the standards are appropriate, and regulators are expected to declare they are not. 
Administration officials are considering proposing a significant reduction in the requirements, according to automakers and government officials.
""We also feel the regulations need to comprehend new developments in the industry ‚Äì like the move away from one owner, one vehicle ‚Äì that have taken place since the rule was finalized in 2012,"" Barra said. ""Current standards did not comprehend increased shared and autonomous electric vehicles.""

GM's ""commitment to an all-electric, zero-emissions future is unwavering, regardless of any modifications to future fuel economy standards,"" she added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Virgin Atlantic's chief executive said he was confident a deal would be done to secure Britain's flying rights after Brexit, as the airline launched an extra legroom economy seat to try to stand out from the crowd amid intense competition. 
British airlines want to be able to continue to benefit from European Union flying rights after Brexit, and the British government has said it will try to secure an open-access deal, but a recent Financial Times report suggested the UK was encountering problems in its negotiations. 
Craig Kreeger, the CEO of Virgin, which primarily flies between the UK and North America, said he believed Britain would secure a deal similar to what it already has under the European Union-United States Open Skies agreement.
""I‚Äôve heard from both governments, I remain completely confident that we‚Äôre on track, to work, through whatever it takes to have, to be able to fly, in an Open Skies-like way,"" he said in an interview with Reuters. 
Kreeger was speaking as Virgin Atlantic on Wednesday announced that it would refit the cabins of its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliners to offer a new type of economy seat with legroom of 34 inches (86 cms), bigger than the 31 inch economy offering.
Virgin also said it would offer an ""economy light"" ticket which excludes checked luggage.
It gave no information about ticket prices, with the new seats not available for sale until Spring. 
The new offering comes amid tough competition on the trans-Atlantic route, with low-cost carriers such as Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC), Canada's Westjet (TO:WJA) and Iceland's Wow Air all stepping up expansion between North America and Europe.
""There isn't any question that trans-Atlantic flying has been changing over the last few years and being able to offer a new lower fare is something we think will enhance our ability to compete,"" Kreeger said. 
IAG (L:ICAG), the owner of Virgin's old rival British Airways, is also in on the action, launching a low-cost long-haul unit called Level last year, while Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) has been expanding its Eurowings brand, and U.S. carriers have introduced fares that don't include baggage or seat selection.
Virgin said the refitting of its cabins was underway and the cost of taking out six seats to make space for the new bigger leg room economy class was ""not material"". 
The new 34-inch legroom seat on Virgin will give passengers an option in between economy and Virgin's premium economy seat.
British Airways and Norwegian also offer economy seats with 31 inches of legroom. Both British Airways and Virgin offer legroom of 38 inches in their premium economy, while Norwegian's premium cabin has legroom of between 43 and 46 inches. 

Last year, Virgin Atlantic said Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) would buy 31 percent of the airline from Richard Branson's Virgin Group, making it the second largest shareholder after U.S. airline Delta, which owns a 49 percent stake, and reducing Virgin Group's stake to 20 percent. That deal has not yet completed.

LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union's securities watchdog said curbs on trading shares in the ""dark"" or off public exchanges across the European Union will be rolled out on March 12 and cover the bulk of blue-chip stocks such as HSBC and  Unilever  (LON:ULVR).
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)published data on Wednesday showing which stocks will be subject to limits on trading in ""dark pools"".
Trading will end up on stock exchanges such as  London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE), Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) or other platforms traded in the same way as bourses.
The data published by ESMA shows the cap will cover over 80 percent of the most heavily traded shares, meaning household named blue chips such as Nestle, British Tobacco, HSBC and Unilever.
The aim is to increase transparency in share trading and stop some investors having an unfair advantage over others. The caps, part of new EU securities rules known as MiFID II introduced in January, were delayed due to insufficient data.
The so-called ""double volume"" caps will require dark pools to suspend trading in stocks for which, on average, more than 8 percent of daily trading was transacted in the dark over the past 12 months.
ESMA said a cap will apply for six months to 17 instruments whose trading on a single platform in January 2018, and 10 instruments whose trading last month, went beyond 4 percent.
A further 727 instruments passed the 8 percent mark in January when trading across all platforms in the EU is totted up, and 633 in February 2018, ESMA said.
Brokers and other market participants have spent months preparing algorithms and trading systems for the introduction of dark pool caps.
Alasdair Haynes, chief executive of Aquis Exchange, said ESMA's statement gives markets clarity and ends rumors that the caps would be delayed indefinitely.
""This makes it very clear what the intent of the regulators are to create greater transparency, a shift away from dark to more lit venues,"" Haynes said.
Dark venues were originally conceived for banks or asset managers to trade large orders without the glare of transparency, which can adversely move prices before such an order is fully executed because of the time it takes.
But over time much smaller orders were ending up on dark pools, raising concerns among regulators.
""As dark volume caps will be implemented from March, we expect market shares at dark venues will decline by about 350 basis points, with most of the gains accruing to the regulated exchanges,"" UBS exchanges analyst Michael Werner said in a note to clients.
Dark trading rose to 9.5 percent of volume on the 12 biggest stock markets in Europe in October 2017, falling back to 8.2 percent last month, UBS said.
""People want it to be a revolution but it won't be, as people will have to assess the benefits and see how they can trade more efficiently,"" Haynes said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. fund investors are warming to the stock market again.
Domestic equity funds took in cash for the first time in four weeks, according to the Investment Company Institute (ICI), as caution toward the markets has once again given way to risk taking.
Some $6.4 billion surged into the domestic-stock investment products in the week ended Feb. 28, according to the trade group for mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Overall, equity funds took in $11.7 billion, helped by a 65th straight week of net inflows for funds focused abroad.
U.S. fund investors wary of rising interest rates and inflation had avoided stocks in their home market during previous weeks.
Those concerns have since ebbed and been replaced by the bogeyman of the United States imposing hefty steel and aluminum tariffs and touching off a global trade war. (N)
That and the withdrawal of monetary policy stimulus are reasons to be cautious around U.S. stocks, which, according to Astoria Portfolio Advisors LLC founder John Davi, remain expensive relative to alternatives.
""Why do you want to own U.S. equities when emerging markets are so much cheaper, Japan is so much cheaper,"" said Davi.
""Bonds are incredibly expensive and crowded. Commodities are the cheapest asset class out there.""
Debt funds grabbed $5.2 billion, the most in three weeks, while commodity funds such as those invested in gold pulled in $278 million, according to ICI.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Wednesday that many online trading platforms for cryptocurrencies should be registered with the regulator and subject to additional rules, in a further sign regulators are cracking down on the digital currency sector.
In a statement, the SEC said these ""potentially unlawful"" platforms may be giving investors an unearned sense of safety by labeling themselves as 'exchanges'. The regulator said many of these platforms likely need to register with the SEC as a regulated national securities exchange or an alternate trading system (ATS).
The new statement marks the latest effort by the SEC to apply existing federal securities laws to the rapidly growing cryptocurrency sector. SEC Chief Jay Clayton has repeatedly expressed concern about cryptocurrencies and ""initial coin offerings,"" or ICOs, and has urged investors to exercise caution.
""The SEC staff has concerns that many online trading platforms appear to investors as SEC-registered and regulated marketplaces when they are not,"" the agency said in the statement.
Clayton has said in the past that he generally considers ICOs to be securities offerings subject to certain regulatory requirements.
On Wednesday, the SEC went further by suggesting the majority of secondary market trading in those digital tokens was also subject to its jurisdiction.
The regulator said any platform providing trading of digital assets that behave like securities and which operate like exchanges must register with the SEC as a national securities exchange, or seek an exemption such as ATS registration. 
While there are dozens of platforms offering trading in cryptocurrencies, Reuters could only identify one, Liquidity M ‚Äì which is the broker dealer for Templum ‚Äì that had registered with the SEC as an ATS, according to SEC data. 
The regulator added that some cryptocurrency platforms may not behave like exchanges but offer related services - such as digital wallets - that trigger other registration requirements, such as becoming a clearing agent or broker dealer.

The SEC statement follows media reports on Tuesday that the U.S. Treasury's financial crime division told Congress in a letter last month that some ICOs may also be subject to the Treasury's money transmission registration, antimoney laundering and Bank Secrecy Act requirements.

Icahn called reports connecting his sale to the tariffs proposal ""categorically untrue,"" and attributed the cut in stake to ""legitimate investment reasons Last month, Icahn reduced his stake in Manitowoc to 4.85 percent from 7.81 percent, according to SEC filings. About a week after that, Trump said he would impose 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent on imported aluminum to make domestic production more attractive.

1669,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 01:01PM ET</span>",IKEA Group's new CFO to maintain investment drive through 2020,"By Anna Ringstrom
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA Group, the world's biggest furniture retailer, will maintain or raise already high levels of investment in coming years as it adapts to fast-changing shopping habits, its new CFO said on Wednesday.
In a strategy shift, privately held IKEA, known for its huge out-of-town warehouse stores, is starting to add city-center showroom formats to entice new generations, while also further developing its online store to stave off competition from internet giants including Amazon.
IKEA must adapt if it is to stay ahead of online-only players such as Amazon (O:AMZN) - which in November launched two furniture brands of its own - as well as Flipkart in India and Germany's Otto and Home24. 
""Of course you can see online players such as Amazon and Flipkart growing,"" Juvencio Maeztu told Reuters in his first interview since becoming chief financial officer of IKEA Group last month. 
""What is more relevant than ever is to be as close as possible to the consumer - it has much more power than before,"" he said.
That partly means maintaining heavy investment, even if it puts pressure on profits as it did in the financial year through last August.
IKEA Group, owner of most IKEA budget furniture stores worldwide, invested 3.1 billion euros in stores, distribution and customer service networks, shopping centers, renewable energy and forestry in its 2016/17 financial year. 
Maeztu said total annual investments in traditional store expansion, new city-center formats, digital services, e-commerce warehouses and distribution would be as high or higher in fiscal 2018-2020 as in 2017.
""We will invest in being more accessible,"" he said. ""We will keep investing the same or even more over the next three years,"" he said. 
INDIA LAUNCH
IKEA also says its strategy of surveying households about their everyday frustrations and ambitions, for instance by making home visits, gives it a competitive edge. 
Maeztu hopes to draw on his recent experience as IKEA's manager for India, where in 2012 the Swedish group was the first foreign single-brand retailer to get approval to open stores in the country. It aims to open its first Indian store, in Hyderabad, early this summer.
In India, his efforts to get close to the customer included 800 visits to family homes either by himself or members of his team during his time there. 
""This is something we will do even more,"" Maeztu said.
IKEA, whose founder Ingvar Kamprad died in January at the age of 91, operates through a franchise system. Inter IKEA is the brand owner and franchisor. IKEA Group owns 393 stores in 29 markets out of a total of 413 store in 49 markets.
Last September IKEA Group made its first-ever acquisition outside the group of companies that make up IKEA when it bought TaskRabbit, a U.S. online marketplace for odd jobs - such as furniture assembly. It has flagged more acquisitions or partnerships could be on the cards.
For the new CFO, that strategy shift spells a new way for the company to keep a lid on costs, a necessity as the market transforms.
""TaskRabbit is an example of partnership in order to really keep prices down at the same time as we are offering the best of IKEA,"" Maeztu said.
""We are exploring other partnerships, but we don't have anything specific (to communicate) now,"" he said.

1671,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 12:50PM ET</span>",Do you need a do-over on your Roth conversion?,"By Gail MarksJarvis
CHICAGO (Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) 
If you turned a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA in 2017, you may be kicking yourself now:¬†What seemed like a clever strategy a few months ago may not seem so smart if your account value dropped.
People do this kind of conversion so they can escape paying taxes on investment growth down the road, because Roth accounts grow tax-free. According to the latest IRS data available, taxpayers in 2015 converted about $4.3 billion into Roths from IRAs.
When you move the money, you have to pay income tax on the amount based on the value of the stocks on the day you do the conversion. That is because IRA contributions go in before taxes, and you pay income tax as you take the money out in retirement. 
If you did a conversion in 2017 while stocks were soaring, you might want to check in. Since the beginning of this year, stocks have been on a wild ride. While the Standard & Poor‚Äôs 500 has recovered from losses and was up 2 percent for the year through Tuesday, your individual holdings may still have dropped. 
Some individual stocks are down more than 10 percent. At the end of February, for instance,  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co was down 16.2 percent, and  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) 10.5 percent. The average core bond fund tracked by Lipper was down 1.6 percent. 
So as you do your 2017 tax return you could face an aggravating realization: You owe taxes on sums that have evaporated.
If you converted $100,000 in 2017 and the value in your Roth is now $90,000, then you would still owe taxes on $100,000 in income ‚Äì which could run more than $20,000 depending on your tax bracket.
The way out? ""Try a do-over,"" said Ed Slott, chief executive of Ed Slott & Company and founder of IRAHelp.com.
For conversions made in 2017, you can simply send your Roth IRA funds back to your IRA. It is called a ""recharacterization,"" and with extensions, you have until October 15, 2018, to make it happen. 
Despite the changes Congress made to get rid of recharacterizations starting on Jan. 1, 2018, the new tax laws do not affect 2017 conversions.¬† 
Going forward, Slott suggests still looking for opportunities to turn traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs ‚Äì you can do this even if you take a do-over on your 2017 conversion. 
Slott notes that doing a conversion will be cheaper for most people in 2018 because they will be in lower tax brackets.
""This is the time to get money into a Roth because taxes are likely to go up in the future,‚Äù Slott said.¬†¬†
Yet, without the right to change your mind in the future, he suggests moving slowly on new conversions ‚Äì possibly waiting until later in the year when you know more about your possible investment declines, your annual income and your overall tax situation. 
To limit the impact on current taxes, Phoenix financial planner Alexander Koury is helping a 50-year-old client convert an IRA into a Roth IRA slowly. With a $2 million IRA, Koury is having a couple convert $250,000 each year for the next four years into a Roth so only $1 million remains in the husband's traditional IRA. 
Each year, they will owe about $50,000 more in taxes based on the extra income, said Koury. But the $1 million Roth could grow tax-free to about $2.6 million, based on a modest 5 percent return by the time he retires in 20 years. 
That is a huge benefit that does not happen in traditional IRAs. With a traditional IRA, everything withdrawn to cover retirement spending will get taxed each year, and at age 70-¬Ω Uncle Sam forces people to withdraw money every year so the government can collect taxes.

Koury‚Äôs conclusion: ""Why not pay taxes now and not ever have to worry about paying taxes again?""

First job: Congressional page
When I was 14, after my freshman year in high school, I was a summer page in the House of Representatives. That basically meant I ran letters and packages all over the Capitol. The advantage of it was that I could interact face-to-face with members of Congress, and sometimes watch proceedings on the House floor.
It was a pretty rude awakening to Congress, warts and all. Also, we were a largely unsupervised group of teenagers, enjoying a lot of freedom, with all that entails. In that sense as well, it was pretty eye-opening.
Even when I was 14, I was interested in the workings of government, so I was lucky that I got to experience it firsthand. I still know my way around Capitol Hill pretty well, and can find my through all the bowels and basements and hidden hallways.
Thomas Pickering

First Job: Forklift driver
This was in Bloomfield, New Jersey, in a plant which manufactured steel casings for fire extinguishers. I had to move big pallet-loads of steel around, which had to be pressed in gas-fired ovens. Luckily I‚Äôm still here, and didn‚Äôt kill anybody.
I remember there was no air conditioning, and this was summertime, so it was hot as hell. 
I think there were some lessons for diplomats in that job. It was hard work, very dangerous, and you always had to think about next steps. It was serious business that was potentially injurious to many people, and so you had to be extremely careful at every moment.
Karen Hughes

First job: McDonald‚Äôs
My first real job was working at McDonald's. The same day I got my driver‚Äôs license, I asked to borrow the family car (we only had one) and my mom recalls that I came home and announced that I had a job. They had always taught me that all work was valuable, and I looked forward to earning my own spending money.
Several days a week in the early evenings, after swim practice, I worked behind the counter filling people‚Äôs orders.¬†McDonald's has great training programs and I learned the value of precision. It also gave me an early taste of the critical importance of customer service.
I can still say ‚Äútwo all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun‚Äù in less than a couple seconds.
Bill Richardson
Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and governor of New Mexico
First job: Landscaper
When I was 17, I was a pitcher in the Cape Cod baseball league. But I had to pay for my own room and board, so in the mornings before games, I was a landscaper in Cotuit, Massachusetts. I would mow lawns, and use tractors to clear brush, and get paid something like $2 an hour. This was back in the late ‚Äò60s.
I remember being so tired, and then after my shift I had to go pitch baseball games. I was a relief pitcher, had a creditable ERA, and would come in to mop up games. I knew I was not going to be a major leaguer, because I was a curveball pitcher, and at age 21 my arm just went dead. At that time they didn‚Äôt have Tommy John surgery, so that was it. 

They had big lawns on Cape Cod, and plenty of wealthy people, so I always had a lot of work to do. To this day, when I see some guy mowing a lawn, I say: Hat‚Äôs off to him. Because it‚Äôs not an easy job.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel has shined a light on U.S. steel companies, whose shares have outperformed the overall market since Trump's election but as a group remain well below levels reached before the financial crisis a decade ago.
The S&P 1500 steel index <.SPCOMSTEEL> has climbed more than 3 percent since Trump last week announced his plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum to protect U.S. producers, which set off fears of a global trade war and spooked the broad stock market.
(GRAPHIC: Steel's Trump bump - http://reut.rs/2FfLXUH)
The past few days have been bumpy for steel stocks, given uncertainty about the timing and extent of the tariffs as Trump faces growing pressure from political and diplomatic allies as well as U.S. companies urging him to pull back.
Investors are accustomed to volatility for the stocks. The sector has climbed more than 40 percent since Trump's November 2016 election, compared with a 27 percent rise for the benchmark S&P 500 index (SPX), but it has taken a roller-coaster path over that time.
The potential for increased spending on U.S. infrastructure under Trump fueled a rise in the shares in the aftermath of the election. But their performance has wobbled as prospects for an infrastructure package waned last year, along with uncertainty over protectionist measures. 
(GRAPHIC: Steel sector's elusive peak - http://reut.rs/2FfJCZz)
Much of the gains for steel stocks are due to improved overall industry conditions, according to analysts, including higher prices, with the global economy strengthening and China reducing its steel production.
‚ÄúThe initial rally happened because he talked about infrastructure,"" said David Lipschitz, an analyst with Macquarie Capital. ‚ÄúUp until the tariff talk recently, prices in the U.S. have rallied nicely because international prices have had a nice rally. China has taken capacity off line.‚Äù
Despite its run, the S&P 1500 steel index remains more than 45 percent below levels reached in mid-2008, before the financial crisis took hold, even as the broad market has marched to record highs.
The sector's rise in the mid-2000s came amid strength in the U.S. economy including non-residential building as well as a surge in construction in China, analysts said.
""When the stocks really, really surged, there was a belief last time that it was going to go on forever, that China was going to continue to build and build and build,"" said Philip Gibbs, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""Their growth rates have definitely slowed dramatically since that time period.""
The stocks were crushed during the global financial crisis as commodity prices tumbled along with equity markets. Demand for steel dropped as construction and auto markets weakened.
Shares of  Nucor  Corp (N:NUE), the largest company in the 13-component steel index by market value and the only steel stock in the S&P 500, remain about 20 percent below levels reached in mid-2008. U.S. Steel Corp (N:X), which traded as high as $196 a share in 2008, now trades at around $44.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gotten better. It‚Äôs not where it was in the mid-2000s,"" Lipschitz said. ""We are still significantly below from a demand perspective (for construction).""
The steel index has performed well since Trump said in mid-February he was considering tariffs.
Gibbs said tariffs could provide a ""sugar high"" for the stocks but that improved pricing could be short lived while higher prices also could hurt demand from manufacturers and could lead to more supply.
""Investors are likely juggling the prospect for higher near-term pricing, but with a view that it is unsustainable and weighing against (potential) demand erosion,"" Gibbs said.

1675,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 12:40PM ET</span>",Kraft Heinz launches incubator for 'disruptive' food startups,"(Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co (O:KHC) has launched an incubator program for food and beverage startups, joining a growing list of U.S. food companies looking at new ways to spur growth as consumers shun processed packaged food in favor of healthier offerings.
Kraft said on Wednesday the platform, called Springboard, will focus on supporting and developing brands that make healthy, organic and experiential products, giving them access to the company's distribution and marketing expertise, research and development and consumer insights.
Smaller, independent brands are seen by many consumers, especially younger ones, to be more hip and healthy and rather than compete with them many big food and drink companies have looked to buy into and learn from startup innovation, a leaf straight out of Silicon Valley's playbook.
Other big U.S. food makers making similar forays into the startup world include  Campbell Soup  Co (N:CPB),  General Mills  (N:GIS) and Kellog Co (N:K).
As part of the program, Springboard will review applications from ""disruptive"" food and beverage startups, which will then receive financial support to build their brands and guidance to raise additional funding, Kraft Heinz said.
Investors were positive about the new venture, but said the platform may not be enough to drive long-term sales growth for Kraft Heinz, which has a market value of about $82.6 billion.
""It will take time to effect change at a company this size, and the Springboard initiative itself will not be sufficient. Nevertheless, it is a step in the right direction,"" Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group, told Reuters. Roosevelt Investment owns Kraft Heinz's shares worth $9.8 million.
Kraft Heinz's move comes a year after Kraft Heinz walked away from a $143 billion bid for  Unilever  (L:ULVR) after the European consumer goods behemoth dismissed the offer as having no financial or strategic merit.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 12:38PM ET</span>",Exclusive: StanChart presses on with Frankfurt job moves as EU rejects Brexit plan,"By Emma Rumney and Lawrence White
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) has started interviewing candidates for about 20 banking jobs it is moving to Frankfurt due to Brexit, the chief financial officer said on Wednesday.
The Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused lender had previously said it was applying to convert its branch in Frankfurt into a subsidiary to serve clients in the European Union after Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford told Reuters in London that the bank was pressing on with the plans to move the positions ""because that provides a degree of certainty irrespective of what will happen on the political front, we will continue with that."" He said interviews for job posts had begun.
British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Wednesday the EU should allow banks access to the bloc's financial services markets after Brexit, making moves like StanChart's unnecessary. But the EU, in draft guidelines for a trade deal, rebuffed that plan.
Halford's comments show how banks are pushing ahead with plans to move staff and operations to Europe, fearing Britain will fail to secure a deal that would give banks a similar level of access to the bloc that they have now.
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) has put more than a dozen banking, sales and trading staff now based in Britain on notice to move to Frankfurt within weeks, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Halford said halting the relocations became more difficult as time passed without clarity on Britain's future ties with the EU, and as the bank allocated resources to the move.
""As each month goes by and we actually not just have the concept of 20 people but we have the hard names of 20 people getting inked in ... the more difficult it becomes,"" he said.

""The clock is ticking,"" he said. ""If you want an assured, continuity of activity there does come a point where unfortunately you've got to get on with these things and just say, even if there was a change of mind on other fronts,¬†it may arrive too late.""

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 11:40AM ET</span>",Electric sportscars blur the need for speed,"By Andreas Cremer
GENEVA (Reuters) - Established sports car brands such as Porsche and Lamborghini are losing the speed crown to lesser-known rivals offering electric supercars boasting record acceleration.
Sports car drivers have long reveled in the muscular horsepower of their combustion-engined supercars, with the time it takes to reach 100 km per hour (kph) from a standing start a major selling point for some venerable brands.
But electric engines have stolen a march on traditional supercars because they instantly generate maximum torque -- the rotational force that is key to powering a car's acceleration.
This instant pulling power allows battery cars to get off the blocks faster than combustion peers, challenging sports car brands on their home turf.
Croatian manufacturer Rimac entered the fray at this week's Geneva auto show with its Concept Two car, priced at a hefty 1.7 million euros ($2.11 million). 
Powered by four electric engines and capable of hitting 100 kph in 1.95 seconds, Concept Two's straight-line acceleration is up there with the new roadster from U.S. electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (O:TSLA).
A more surprising entrant comes in the form of Volkswagen's (DE:VOWG_p) Spanish brand Seat, better known for the compacts and sport-utility vehicles it makes for the mass market.
SEAT SUPERCAR
Seat was at the show with its CUPRA e-racer, which hits 100 kph in 3.2 seconds. That may sound somewhat sedate compared with the Rimac car, but it still beats the 4.5 seconds of Porsche's petrol-powered 370-horsepower 911 Carrera T.
Unfazed by the newcomers, Volkswagen-owned Porsche reckons that engine and battery performance over time will be more important. Its Mission E electric cars will be capable of rapid 800-volt charging, beating Tesla's 480-volt superchargers.
""Very fast acceleration can probably be achieved by very many"" manufacturers in the electric age, Porsche R&D chief Michael Steiner said in an interview. ""But for us, that's not enough. Charging capacity and charging time is an area where we can and want to stand out.""
Porsche's electric crossover concept ""Mission E Cross Turismo"" needs 3.5 seconds for the 100 kph sprint and would compete with Tesla's Model X as the German company pursues its goal of raising the share of electric models to about a quarter of overall sales by 2025.
Lamborghini, which has shunned all-electric cars and is known for its extreme supercars with roaring V10 and V12 engines, said road-handling has eclipsed acceleration as the key parameter for vehicle performance. 
The Italian brand presented the Huracan Performante Spyder, a lighter and more powerful convertible version of the base model. The new model needs 3.1 seconds for the 0-100 kph sprint. 
LAMBORGHINI ADJUSTS
""At one time acceleration was fundamental,"" R&D chief Maurizio Reggiani said in an interview. ""Now it's more complex.""
As parent VW pushes new technologies to turn the page on its emissions scandal, Lamborghini has recognized the need to adjust. The brand is working on hybrids while seeking to fully exploit the potential of its naturally aspirated high-performance engines. 
""We need to differentiate our products, but we also need to respect the supersport mission of our cars,"" Reggiani said, declining to elaborate.
Tobias Moers, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz's (DE:DAIGn) AMG high-performance brand, said there is still a market for cars that go fast but that faster engines in conventional cars are not enough to differentiate his brand in the market.
""This is one of the reasons why we have presented the latest four-door GT,"" he said. ""It has a distinct body shape from other Mercedes-Benz models, it is our fourth car with a unique body.""
Meanwhile, Hans-Joachim Stuck, a former German F1 racing driver, urged calm amid the flurry of top-speed EV announcements, saying the old guard will always retain their customer base.
""Porsche will always be fast and a benchmark,"" he said. ""Their design is great, the vehicles are robust and reliable and the brand has a pedigree. 
""Speed alone isn't what matters.""

1696,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 07, 2018 11:31AM ET</span>","Daimler, Volvo Cars executives skeptical over Geely alliance plan","GENEVA (Reuters) - Executives at  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Volvo Cars question the viability and industrial logic of a plan by their major shareholder, China's Geely, to form an auto industry alliance to counter ""tech invaders.""
Li revealed last month he had built up an almost 10 percent stake in Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler, hoping to access electric and self-driving cars technology as a way to respond to new competitors such as Uber [UBER.UL] and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
But executives at the Geneva auto show from both Daimler and Volvo Cars questioned how a deal could work without compromising their own independence and leadership in key technologies.
Because Zhejiang Geely Holding already owns Volvo Cars, a stake in truckmaker AB Volvo (ST:VOLVb), and 49.9 percent of Malaysian automaker Proton, German executives fear any wide-ranging cooperation could strengthen an industry rival. 
""Ideally we want a win-win alliance. Handing Volvo and Geely our Mercedes technology is not win-win,"" one Mercedes-Benz executive, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Geely's proposal poses a further challenge to the Germans, because Mercedes-Benz, which has expertise in self-driving cars, connected vehicle and electrification technology, already has an alliance with Renault-Nissan (PA:RENA) (T:7211). 
It also has a deal to build conventional and electric cars in China with existing joint-venture partner BAIC Motor Corporation (HK:1958).
Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche cautiously welcomed his new shareholder at the Geneva show, expressing admiration for Li and Geely, but said any alliance would depend on keeping BAIC happy. ""We will examine everything if it is in keeping with the wishes of our partner,"" Zetsche told reporters. 
Geely's ownership of a stake in Volvo trucks, a direct competitor to Daimler's trucks business, makes cooperation particularly difficult in the area of commercial vehicles, Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters.
""In the truck business, Daimler and Volvo are really heads on competitors, maybe in a more sharper way than we are with Daimler,"" Samuelsson said. ""It is difficult to invest in two competitors.""
While Li's aim is to forge an alliance primarily between carmakers, cooperation there is also tricky, he added.
Strong companies with a technological edge are unwilling to share areas of expertise where they have a competitive advantage, or where they believe it will be a key differentiating factor in future, Samuelsson said. 
For Volvo, this would be in the area of autonomous driving.
""If you believe you can do it better yourself, you have no interest to share it with somebody else,"" Samuelsson said.
In more generic areas such as brakes, shock absorbers and gear boxes, there is broader scope for cooperation, but these technologies can already be bought from suppliers, making it hard to have a meaningful alliance, he added. 
Before investing in Daimler, Geely also held talks with  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (N:FCAU) (MI:FCHA), the head of the Italian-American carmaker said this week. 
""We have a number of institutional meetings in the industry; we consider them to be a matter of normal practice,"" Sergio Marchionne told reporters in Geneva, adding it had been a ""pleasant exchange.""

Marchionne declined to go into detail about the talks, but concluded Fiat Chrysler did not need ""a Chinese investor.""
